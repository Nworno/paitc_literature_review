THE USE OF MATCHING ADJUSTED INDIRECT COMPARISON (MAIC) IN THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN SUGGESTED. WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF A MAIC USED TO EVALUATE THE INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OFFERED BY ADDING SIMEPREVIR (SMV) TO STANDARD THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS INFECTED WITH GENOTYPE 4 HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV). INDIVIDUAL PATIENT DATA FOR A SINGLE ARM STUDY EVALUATING THE USE OF SMV WITH PEGINTERFERON ALFA 2AÂ€‰+Â€‰RIBAVIRIN (PR) IN GENOTYPE 4 HCV WERE AVAILABLE (RESTORE STUDY). A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WAS USED TO IDENTIFY STUDIES OF PR ALONE USED IN THE SAME PATIENT GROUP. BY APPLYING THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR EACH STUDY IN TURN TO THE RESTORE DATASET AND THEN APPLYING THE PUBLISHED MAIC COVARIATE MATCHING ALGORITHM, A SERIES OF PSEUDOSAMPLES FROM RESTORE WERE GENERATED. AFTER ASSESSMENT OF THE MATCHING OUTCOMES, THE BEST MATCHED COMPARISONS WERE USED TO DERIVE ESTIMATES OF EFFICACY FOR SMVÂ€‰+Â€‰PR IN PATIENTS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE PARTICIPATING IN THE PR TRIAL. FIVE POTENTIAL COMPARATOR STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED. AFTER APPLYING THE MATCHING PROCESS, TWO EMERGED AS OFFERING THE GREATEST EQUIVALENCE WITH THE GENERATED RESTORE PSEUDOSAMPLES AND WERE USED TO ESTIMATE SMVÂ€‰+Â€‰PR EFFICACY, EXPRESSED AS THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS ACHIEVING SUSTAINED VIRAL RESPONSE (SVR). IN ONE COMPARISON, SVR IN THE SMVÂ€‰+Â€‰PR GROUP WAS 85% VERSUS 63% FOR PR ALONE. IN THE SECOND COMPARISON, THE CORRESPONDING SVRS WERE 77% AND 44% RESPECTIVELY. AFTER MATCHING FOR VARYING BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS, BOTH COMPARISONS OF RESTORE VERSUS STUDIES OF PR ALONE YIELDED A BENEFIT FOR SMVÂ€‰+Â€‰PR VS PR ALONE IN GENOTYPE 4 HCV-INFECTED PATIENTS. THE INCREMENTAL GAIN IN SVR ASSOCIATED WITH USE OF SMV RANGED FROM 22% TO 33%.

A PARTITIONED SURVIVAL MODEL WITH THREE HEALTH STATES (STABLE DISEASE, PROGRESSIVE DISEASE, DEATH) WAS DEVELOPED OVER A 20-YEAR TIME HORIZON. CERITINIB'S EFFICACY INPUTS (PROGRESSION-FREE AND OVERALL SURVIVAL) WERE ESTIMATED FROM ASCEND-4; PARAMETRIC SURVIVAL MODELS EXTRAPOLATED DATA BEYOND THE TRIAL PERIOD. THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF CERITINIB VS CHEMOTHERAPY WAS OBTAINED FROM ASCEND-4, THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF CERITINIB VS CRIZOTINIB WAS ESTIMATED USING A MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT COMPARISON BASED ON ASCEND-4 AND PROFILE 1014. DRUG ACQUISITION, TREATMENT ADMINISTRATION, ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT, AND MEDICAL COSTS WERE OBTAINED FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASES AND THE LITERATURE, AND INFLATED TO 2016Â€‰US DOLLARS. TREATMENT-SPECIFIC STABLE-STATE UTILITIES WERE DERIVED FROM TRIALS AND PROGRESSIVE-STATE UTILITY FROM THE LITERATURE. INCREMENTAL COSTS PER QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEAR (QALY) WERE ESTIMATED FOR CERITINIB VS EACH COMPARATOR. COST-EFFECTIVENESS WAS ASSESSED BASED ON US WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY THRESHOLDS. DETERMINISTIC AND PROBABILISTIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO TEST MODEL ROBUSTNESS. IN THE BASE CASE, FIRST-LINE CERITINIB WAS ASSOCIATED WITH TOTAL DIRECT COSTS OF $299,777 AND 3.28 QALYS (FROM 4.61 LIFE YEARS GAINED [LYG]) OVER 20 YEARS. FIRST-LINE CRIZOTINIB AND CHEMOTHERAPY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 2.73 AND 2.41 QALYS, 3.92 AND 3.53 LYG, AND $263,172 AND $228,184 TOTAL DIRECT COSTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREMENTAL COST PER QALY GAINED WAS $66,064 FOR CERITINIB VS CRIZOTINIB AND $81,645 FOR CERITINIB VS CHEMOTHERAPY. IN THE FIRST 2 YEARS FOLLOWING TREATMENT INITIATION, CERITINIB DOMINATED CRIZOTINIB BY CONFERRING GREATER HEALTH BENEFITS AT REDUCED TOTAL COSTS.

DIRECT COMPARISONS OF THESE TREATMENTS ARE NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO A LACK OF HEAD-TO-HEAD TRIALS. WE COMPARED 2 YEAR EFFICACY OF DMF VERSUS FINGOLIMOD AT THE APPROVED DOSAGE USING A MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT APPROACH. INDIVIDUAL PATIENT DATA FROM DEFINE AND CONFIRM, AND AGGREGATE DATA FROM FREEDOMS AND FREEDOMS II, WERE POOLED AND COMPARED USING THE MATCHING-ADJUSTED IN-DIRECT METHOD. TO ACCOUNT FOR CROSS-TRIAL DIFFERENCES, DATA FROM TRIALS WITH AVAILABLE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT DATA WERE ADJUSTED TO MATCH AGGREGATE DATA (I.E. AVERAGE PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS) FROM TRIALS WITHOUT PATIENT-LEVEL DATA. DATA FROM DMF-TREATED PATIENTS WERE WEIGHTED SUCH THAT AVERAGE BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS MATCHED THOSE OF FINGOLIMOD-TREATED PATIENTS. AFTER MATCHING, WEIGHTED TREATMENT OUTCOMES FOR DMF-TREATED PATIENTS (240Â€‰MG TWICE DAILY) WERE COMPARED WITH SUMMARY OUTCOMES FOR FINGOLIMOD-TREATED PATIENTS (0.5Â€‰MG ONCE DAILY). ALL COMPARISON RESULTS OF DMF VERSUS FINGOLIMOD USED FINGOLIMOD AS THE REFERENCE. AFTER MATCHING, BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS WERE BALANCED BETWEEN DMF AND FINGOLIMOD. AT YEAR 2, THE EFFICACY OF DMF WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF FINGOLIMOD FOR ANNUALIZED RELAPSE RATE (RATE RATIO [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI)]: 1.11 [0.88, 1.40]), 12 WEEK CONFIRMED DISABILITY PROGRESSION (HAZARD RATIO [95% CI]: 0.90 [0.63, 1.29]), AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITE (MEAN DIFFERENCE [95% CI]: 0.04 [-0.05, 0.13]). FOR PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES (EUROQOL 5-DIMENSIONS QUESTIONNAIRE), THE MEAN DIFFERENCES (95% CI) WERE 0.05 (0.01, 0.08) FOR UTILITY SCORE AND 3.22 (0.58, 5.86) FOR VISUAL ANALOG SCALE SCORE, SIGNIFICANTLY FAVORING DMF. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WITH NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE ACTIVITY (NEDA) FOR DMF VERSUS FINGOLIMOD AMONG MATCHING-ADJUSTED PATIENTS WITH COMPLETE NEDA DATA: RATE RATIO (95% CI): 0.92 (0.51, 1.64).

THIS STUDY IMPLEMENTS A MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT COMPARISON TECHNIQUE TO ADDRESS THAT GAP. PATIENT-LEVEL DATA FROM A PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL OF ADALIMUMAB (ADEPT) WERE RE-WEIGHTED TO MATCH AVERAGE BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS FROM PIVOTAL PUBLISHED TRIALS OF ETANERCEPT AND INFLIXIMAB. ADEPT PATIENTS WERE RE-WEIGHTED BY ODDS OF ENROLLMENT IN COMPARATOR TRIALS, ESTIMATED USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION. MATCHED-ON CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDED PSA DURATION, AGE, GENDER, SEVERITY, ACTIVE PSORIASIS, AND CONCOMITANT TREATMENT. AFTER MATCHING, PLACEBO-ADJUSTED TREATMENT ARMS WERE COMPARED AT WEEKS 12 (OR 14) AND 24. OUTCOMES INCLUDED ACR20/50/70, PSARC, HAQ, AND MODIFIED TSS. PASI50/75/90 WERE COMPARED FOR PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE PSORIASIS. COST PER RESPONDER (CPR) WAS ASSESSED IN THE US AND GERMANY USING MATCHING-ADJUSTED END-POINTS AND DRUG LIST PRICES. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS ASSESSED USING WEIGHTED T-TESTS. AFTER MATCHING, ADALIMUMAB-TREATED PATIENTS HAD GREATER PLACEBO-ADJUSTED RATES OF ACR70 AND PASI50/75/90 AT WEEK 24 COMPARED WITH ETANERCEPT (ALL PÂ€‰<Â€‰0.05). ADALIMUMAB PATIENTS HAD A HIGHER PLACEBO-ADJUSTED RATE OF ACR70 THAN INFLIXIMAB AT WEEK 14 (PÂ€‰=Â€‰0.034). ADALIMUMAB TREATMENT HAD LOWER CPR FOR ACR70 AND PASI50/75/90 COMPARED WITH ETANERCEPT AT WEEK 24, IN BOTH THE US AND GERMANY (ALL PÂ€‰<Â€‰0.02). ADALIMUMAB HAD LOWER CPR THAN INFLIXIMAB FOR ALL OUTCOMES AT WEEK 24 (ALL PÂ€‰<Â€‰0.05). ADALIMUMAB IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER ACR70 AND PASI50/75/90 RESPONSE RATES THAN ETANERCEPT AT WEEK 24 AND A HIGHER ACR70 RESPONSE RATE THAN INFLIXIMAB AT WEEK 14.

GIVEN THE RAPID EFFECT OF BREXANOLONE INJECTION (WITHIN 60Â H) SUSTAINED THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH OF THE TRIALS (30Â DAYS), WE SOUGHT TO COMPARE ITS EFFICACY DATA AGAINST SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIS), THE CLASS OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS MOST COMMONLY PRESCRIBED FOR PPD, USING HAM-D AND EDINBURGH POSTNATAL DEPRESSION SCALE (EPDS) OUTCOMES FROM CURRENTLY AVAILABLE RCTS.

ITCS WERE CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCES IN CHANGE FROM BASELINE (CFB) IN HAM-D AND, SEPARATELY, CFB IN EPDS, BETWEEN TREATMENTS, AND REPORTED WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS). FOR ALL TIME POINTS, MAICS SHOWED LARGER DIFFERENCES IN CFB FOR BREXANOLONE COMPARED WITH SSRIS. DIFFERENCES (95% CIS) BETWEEN BREXANOLONE AND SSRIS WERE 12.79 (8.04-17.53) [DAYÂ 3], 5.87 (-Â€‰1.62 TO 13.37) [WEEKÂ 4] AND 0.97 (-Â€‰6.35 TO 8.30) [LAST OBSERVATION] FOR THE HAM-D.

INDIRECT TREATMENT COMPARISONS (ITCS), NAMELY NETWORK META-ANALYSIS (NMA), ANCHORED MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT COMPARISON (MAIC), AND SIMULATED TREATMENT COMPARISON (STC), WERE CONDUCTED TO COMPARE THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF THESE THERAPIES. PATIENT-LEVEL DATA FROM A STUDY THAT EVALUATED INO WITH STANDARD OF CARE (SOC) CHEMOTHERAPY (INO-VATE-ALL) AND PUBLISHED DATA FROM A STUDY THAT EVALUATED BLINA WITH SOC CHEMOTHERAPY (TOWER) WERE USED IN THE ANALYSES. ENDPOINTS EVALUATED INCLUDED REMISSION RATE DEFINED AS COMPLETE REMISSION OR COMPLETE REMISSION WITH INCOMPLETE HEMATOLOGIC RECOVERYÂ (CR/CRI), HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HSCT), OVERALL SURVIVALÂ (OS), AND EVENT-FREE SURVIVALÂ (EFS). FOR EACH OUTCOME, TREATMENT-EFFECT MODIFIERS WERE ADJUSTED FOR IN THE ANCHORED MAIC AND STC ANALYSES. ANALYSES SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT HIGHER RATES OF REMISSION AND HSCT WITH INO COMPARED TO BLINA IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ITC METHOD USED OR MEASURE OF THE EFFECT (I.E., ODDS RATIOÂ [OR] OR RATE DIFFERENCE). THE TREATMENT EFFECTS DERIVED FROM THE MAIC AND STC ANALYSES WERE CONSISTENT AND STRONGER THAN THOSE ESTIMATED FROM THE NMA. A TREND FAVORING INO WAS DETECTED FOR EFS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF POM-D, DARA, AND CAR IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION FROM A US PAYER'S PERSPECTIVE. A COST-EFFECTIVENESS MODEL WAS DEVELOPED TO ESTIMATE THE COST AND HEALTH OUTCOMES OVER A 3-YEAR TIME HORIZON IN 3 HEALTH STATES: PROGRESSION-FREE, POST-PROGRESSION, AND DEATH. THE MAIN EFFICACY DATA SOURCE WAS A MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT COMPARISON USING DATA FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED STUDIES. DIRECT MEDICAL COSTS WERE CONSIDERED, INCLUDING: TREATMENT ACQUISITION AND ADMINISTRATION (INITIAL LINE AND SUBSEQUENT LINE), PRE- AND POST-MEDICATION, PROPHYLAXIS TREATMENT, ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT, AND HEALTH CARE RESOURCE UTILIZATION. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED. A SCENARIO ANALYSIS THAT ASSUMED EQUAL EFFICACY ACROSS ALL 3 TREATMENTS WAS CONDUCTED. COSTS, LIFE-YEARS, AND QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE-YEARS WERE ESTIMATED AND DISCOUNTED AT 3% PER ANNUM. OVER 3 YEARS, THE USE OF POM-D WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIMILAR LIFE-YEARS AND QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE-YEARS GAINED COMPARED WITH DARA AND CAR (INCREMENTAL: LIFE-YEARS, +0.02 AND +0.07, RESPECTIVELY; QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE-YEARS, +0.01 AND +0.05), AND WITH A COST LESS THAN THAT OF DARA (-$8,919) AND SIMILAR TO THAT OF CAR (-$195). SENSITIVITY ANALYSES ILLUSTRATED THAT THE RESULTS WERE SENSITIVE TO PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL, TREATMENT DURATION, AND DRUG COSTS. AN EQUAL EFFICACY SCENARIO RESULTED IN COST-SAVINGS RELATIVE TO THOSE OF BOTH DARA AND CAR (-$11,779 AND -$12,595).

HOWEVER, OTHER STUDY DESIGNS OR METHODS COULD BE USED TO INDIRECTLY COMPARE THESE TWO MEDICATIONS. MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT COMPARISON (MAIC) IS A RECENT METHODOLOGY THAT UTILIZES INDIVIDUAL PATIENT DATA (IPD) FROM CLINICAL TRIALS FOR ONE TREATMENT AND PUBLISHED AGGREGATE DATA FROM ANOTHER TREATMENT TO ESTIMATE THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF BOTH, PROVIDING RAPID, RELIABLE COMPARATIVE EFFICACY RESULTS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY OF GXR AND ATX FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADHD USING MAIC. A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY ATX AND GXR TRIALS PUBLISHED THROUGH DECEMBER 2012. STUDIES WERE SELECTED FOR MAIC ANALYSES ON THE BASIS OF HAVING COMPARABLE TRIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND STUDY DESIGNS. SUMMARY DATA FROM SELECTED ATX TRIALS AND IPD FROM SELECTED GXR TRIALS WERE USED. MAIC METHODOLOGY ENSURED COMPARABLE POPULATIONS: TARGET DOSES FOR THE 'BASE CASE' COMPARISON WERE SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF MAXIMUM EFFECTIVE DOSAGE RANGES FROM THE US FDA-APPROVED PRODUCT LABELS (GXR 0.09-0.12 MG/KG/DAY, ATX 1.2 MG/KG/DAY FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WEIGHING Â‰¤70 KG). INDIVIDUALS FROM GXR TRIALS WERE SELECTED IF THEY MATCHED INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA FROM SELECTED ATX TRIALS; SELECTED GXR IPD WERE THEN RE-WEIGHTED TO MATCH THE PUBLISHED ATX TRIAL MEAN BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS AND PLACEBO OUTCOMES. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED, EXAMINING DIFFERENT DOSAGE RANGES AND REPEATING THE ANALYSIS IN A LARGER NUMBER OF TRIALS, ALLOWING FOR LARGER AND MORE HETEROGENEOUS TRIAL POPULATIONS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS CHANGE IN ADHD RATING SCALE IV (ADHD-RS-IV) TOTAL SCORE. USING MAIC IN THE BASE CASE COMPARISON, SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN MEAN (STANDARD ERROR; SE) ADHD-RS-IV TOTAL SCORES FROM BASELINE TO END OF STUDY WERE OBSERVED IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH GXR RELATIVE TO ATX [-7.0 (2.2); P < 0.01]. SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS FOR GXR OVER ATX WERE ALSO DEMONSTRATED FOR HYPERACTIVITY/IMPULSIVITY [-3.8 (1.2); P < 0.01] AND INATTENTION [-3.2 (1.3); P < 0.05] SUBSCALES OF THE ADHD-RS-IV. SIMILAR RESULTS WERE OBSERVED IN MAIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSES EVALUATING OTHER DOSAGE RANGES AND USING MORE HETEROGENEOUS TRIAL POPULATIONS (E.G., LARGER RANDOMIZED SAMPLE, BROADER SUBJECT WEIGHT RANGE, ADDITIONAL TRIALS). MEAN (SE) DECREASES IN ADHD-RS-IV TOTAL SCORES WERE GREATER FOR GXR RELATIVE TO ATX WHEN INCLUDING IPD FOR THOSE ADMINISTERED GXR AT LOWER THAN TARGET DOSAGE (0.075-0.090 MG/KG/DAY) COMPARED WITH ATX AT TARGET DOSAGE (1.2 MG/KG/DAY), WITH A RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF -6.0 (2.7) (P < 0.05). REDUCTIONS IN ADHD-RS-IV TOTAL SCORES WERE ALSO GREATER FOR GXR IN ANOTHER MAIC EXAMINING GXR AT TARGET DOSAGE (0.09-0.12 MG/KG/DAY) AND A BROADER RANGE OF ATX DOSAGES (INCLUDING THREE ADDITIONAL TRIALS EVALUATING ATX Â‰¥1.2 MG/KG/DAY); RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT FOR GXR VERSUS ATX ADMINISTERED AT TARGET DOSAGE OR HIGHER WAS -7.6 (1.4) (P < 0.01).

DOWNSTAGING FAILURE WAS DEFINED AS STABLE PROGRESSIVE DISEASE OR POST-TREATMENT MORTALITY. THE STATISTICAL METHOD OF ""MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT COMPARISON"" WAS USED TO MATCH THE STUDY GROUP TO THE XXL POPULATION. DOWNSTAGING FAILURE RATE WAS CONSIDERABLY LOWER IN THE STUDY GROUP THAN IN THE XXL TRIAL (12% VS. 32%,   VALUE = |0.683|). THE SURVIVAL CURVES OF OUR LT GROUP (  = 68) OVERLAPPED WITH THOSE OF THE LT-XXL GROUP (  = 0.846). SURVIVAL CURVES OF NON-LT CANDIDATES WITH A SUSTAINED COMPLETE RESPONSE (  = 64) WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF TRANSPLANTED PATIENTS (  = 0.281).

PATIENTS TAKING EVEROLIMUS WERE WEIGHTED UP OR DOWN BASED ON THEIR COMBINATION OF PROGNOSTIC VARIABLES. WEIGHTS WERE CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE PROPORTION OF PATIENTS OBSERVED IN AXIS FOR A GIVEN CHARACTERISTIC BY THE PROPORTION OBSERVED IN RECORD-1 AND TAKING THE PRODUCT OF THE VALUES DERIVED FOR ALL THREE WEIGHTING VARIABLES CONSIDERED. WEIGHTED PFS DISTRIBUTIONS WERE DERIVED WITH BOOTSTRAPPED 95% CIS AND COMPARED WITH THOSE REPORTED FOR THE AXIS TRIAL. AFTER WEIGHTING, DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE 3 KEY BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS WERE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED BETWEEN THE 2 STUDIES; HOWEVER, SOME DIFFERENCES REMAINED. A SLIGHTLY LOWER RATE OF POOR-RISK PATIENTS WAS EVIDENT IN RECORD-1 (30%) VERSUS AXIS (36%), AND A 9% LOWER PROPORTION OF MALES WAS OBSERVED IN THE EVEROLIMUS GROUP COMPARED WITH THE AXITINIB GROUP. DISTRIBUTIONS OF TIME RECEIVING PRIOR SUNITINIB THERAPY WERE ALMOST EQUIVALENT BETWEEN THE TREATMENT ARMS.

THE CURRENT STUDY ASSESSED THE PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL (PFS) AND OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS) OUTCOMES WITH PAN + BTZ + DEX VERSUS LEN + DEX (PRIMARY COMPARATOR) AND POM + DEX (EXPLORATORY COMPARATOR). SINCE AN ANCHOR-BASED INDIRECT TREATMENT COMPARISON WAS NOT FEASIBLE, THE MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT TREATMENT COMPARISON APPROACH WAS USED. TO COMPARE THE SURVIVAL OUTCOMES, PATIENT-LEVEL DATA WERE GENERATED FOR THE COMPARATORS UTILIZING PUBLISHED KAPLAN-MEIER SURVIVAL ESTIMATES. THE USE OF APPROXIMATED PATIENT-LEVEL DATA AND MATCHED DATA FOR PAN + BTZ + DEX ALLOWED THE USE OF COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODELS AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS ASSUMPTION. IN CASES WHERE THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT THE PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS ASSUMPTION WAS VIOLATED, TIME-DEPENDENT HAZARD RATIOS (HRS) WERE ESTIMATED. MEDIAN AND MEAN VALUES FOR PFS AND OS WERE PREDICTED. FOR BOTH PFS AND OS, THE PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS ASSUMPTION WAS NOT SATISFIED, THEREFORE TIME-DEPENDENT HRS WERE ESTIMATED.

SINCE 2004, THE NUMBER OF DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPIES (DMTS) FOR MS HAS GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY. AS A RESULT, PATIENTS, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, AND INSURERS ARE INCREASINGLY INTERESTED IN COMPARATIVE EFFICACY AND SAFETY EVALUATIONS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TREATMENT OPTIONS, BUT HEAD-TO-HEAD STUDIES BETWEEN DMTS ARE LIMITED. THE AIM OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO COMPARE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OUTCOMES WITH THE DMTS OZANIMOD AND DIMETHYL FUMARATE (DMF) USING A MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT COMPARISON (MAIC) TO ADJUST FOR CROSS-TRIAL DIFFERENCES IN STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION. A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY CLINICAL STUDIES EVALUATING THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF OZANIMOD COMPARED WITH DMF. INDIVIDUAL PATIENT-LEVEL DATA (IPD) FOR OZANIMOD WERE OBTAINED FROM THE SUNBEAM AND RADIANCE PART B TRIALS, AND AGGREGATE-LEVEL PATIENT DATA (APD) FOR DMF WERE OBTAINED FROM CONFIRM AND DEFINE. A MAIC IS USED TO WEIGHT IPD TO APD BASED ON IMPORTANT BASELINE PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS CONSIDERED TO BE EFFECT MODIFIERS OR PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE COVARIATE DISTRIBUTION TO ESTABLISH MORE HOMOGENOUS TRIAL POPULATIONS. ONCE TRIAL POPULATIONS ARE DETERMINED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY HOMOGENOUS, OUTCOMES OF INTEREST ARE ESTIMATED AND USED TO GENERATE TREATMENT EFFECTS BETWEEN THE WEIGHTED IPD AND APD. WE USED MAIC METHODOLOGY TO COMPARE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OUTCOMES OF INTEREST BETWEEN OZANIMOD 1.0 MG ONCE DAILY (OD) AND DMF 240 MG TWICE DAILY (BID), INCLUDING CONFIRMED DISABILITY PROGRESSION (CDP) AT 3 AND 6 MONTHS, ANNUALIZED RELAPSE RATE (ARR), PROPORTION OF PATIENTS RELAPSED, OVERALL ADVERSE EVENTS (AES), SERIOUS AES (SAES), AND DISCONTINUATIONS DUE TO AES. AFTER MATCHING PATIENT DATA, BASELINE PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS WERE BALANCED BETWEEN PATIENTS RECEIVING OZANIMOD AND THOSE RECEIVING DMF. COMPARED WITH DMF, OZANIMOD DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED CDP AT 3 MONTHS (HAZARD RATIO 0.67; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 0.53-0.86), ARR (RATE RATIO [RR] 0.80; 95% CI 0.67-0.97), PROPORTION OF PATIENTS RELAPSED (ODDS RATIO [OR] 0.66; 95% CI 0.52-0.83), OVERALL AES (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.08-0.16), SAES (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.19-0.39), AND DISCONTINUATIONS (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.07-0.17). CDP AT 6 MONTHS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE TWO AGENTS (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.62-1.26). AFTER ADJUSTMENT OF BASELINE PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS, THE MAIC DEMONSTRATED THAT THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF OZANIMOD 1.0 MG OD WAS SUPERIOR TO THAT OF DMF 240 MG BID.

PATIENTS WITH ADHD WHO ARE INTOLERANT OF OR DO NOT HAVE AN OPTIMAL RESPONSE TO STIMULANTS OFTEN USE NON-STIMULANTS AS ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES. GUANFACINE EXTENDED-RELEASE (GXR) AND ATOMOXETINE (ATX) ARE THE ONLY NON-STIMULANTS APPROVED BY THE US FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FOR ONCE-DAILY USE IN THE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH ADHD IN THE US. ATX HAS BEEN ON THE MARKET SINCE 2002 WHILE GXR WAS RECENTLY APPROVED IN 2009. TO DATE, THERE IS NO COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OR COST-EFFECTIVENESS STUDY COMPARING THE TWO DRUGS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF GXR VERSUS ATX FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADHD IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS, USING THE COMPARATIVE EFFICACY RESULTS FROM A MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT COMPARISON (MAIC). THE MAIC METHOD WAS USED TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY BETWEEN GXR (TARGET DOSE AND LOWER DOSES) AND ATX (TARGET DOSE) IN THE ABSENCE OF HEAD-TO-HEAD CLINICAL TRIALS. INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS IN THE GXR TRIALS WERE WEIGHTED SUCH THAT THE SUMMARY BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS AND THE EFFICACY OF THE PLACEBO ARM OF THE GXR TRIALS MATCHED EXACTLY WITH THOSE FROM PUBLISHED ATX TRIALS. AFTER WEIGHTING, THE EFFICACY (I.E. CHANGE IN THE ADHD RATING SCALE, FOURTH EDITION [ADHD-RS-IV] TOTAL SCORE FROM BASELINE) WAS COMPARED BETWEEN EACH GXR DOSING GROUP AND THE ATX GROUP. THE RESULTS FROM THE MAIC ANALYSES WERE USED TO POPULATE A 1-YEAR MARKOV MODEL THAT IS USED TO COMPARE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF GXR VERSUS ATX FROM A US THIRD-PARTY PAYER PERSPECTIVE. EFFECTIVENESS OUTCOMES FOR EACH TREATMENT GROUP WERE ESTIMATED AS THE PROPORTION OF RESPONDERS, DEFINED AS PATIENTS WITH Â‰¥25% REDUCTION IN ADHD-RS-IV TOTAL SCORE FROM BASELINE, AND AVERAGE QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (QALYS). UTILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONSE/NON-RESPONSE AND DISUTILITIES DUE TO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE APPLIED IN THE MODEL. COSTS INCLUDED DRUG AND MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS AND WERE INFLATED TO 2011 US DOLLARS ($US). INCREMENTAL COST/QALY AND INCREMENTAL COST/RESPONDER WERE ESTIMATED. UNIVARIATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED BY VARYING ALL MODEL PARAMETERS, INCLUDING COSTS, UTILITIES, AND RESPONSE RATE. THE TARGET DOSE OF GXR WAS 0.12Â€‰MG/KG/DAY. IN MATCH-ADJUSTED POPULATIONS WITH BALANCED BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS, PATIENTS RECEIVING GXR AT THE DOSE OF 0.09-0.12(P = 0.0016) [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] AND 0.075-0.09Â€‰MG/KG/DAY (PÂ€‰=Â€‰0.0248) HAD BETTER EFFICACY, WHILE THOSE RECEIVING GXR AT THE DOSE OF 0.046-0.075Â€‰MG/KG/DAY HAD COMPARABLE EFFICACY (PÂ€‰=Â€‰0.0699), COMPARED WITH PATIENTS RECEIVING ATX AT THE TARGET DOSE OF 1.2Â€‰MG/KG/DAY. IN THE BASE CASE OF THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS (CEA), GXR HAD INCREMENTAL COST-EFFECTIVENESS RATIOS OF $US10Â€‰637/QALY AND $US853/RESPONDER, COMPARED WITH ATX (INCREMENTAL COSTS: $US74; INCREMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS: 0.007 QALYS AND 86 RESPONDERS PER 1000 PATIENTS TREATED). RESULTS OF ALL UNIVARIATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE MODEL RESULTS WERE ROBUST TO CHANGES IN MODEL INPUTS. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST APPLICATION OF THE NOVEL COMPARATIVE EFFICACY METHOD OF MAIC TO A CEA MODEL.

A MATCHING-ADJUSTED INDIRECT COMPARISON WAS CONDUCTED USING INDIVIDUAL PATIENT DATA FROM THE ADEPT TRIAL OF ADALIMUMAB AND PUBLISHED DATA FROM FUTURE I AND II. TO ADJUST FOR THE CROSS-TRIAL DIFFERENCES, INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS IN ADEPT WERE RE-WEIGHTED SO THAT THE MEAN BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS (INCLUDING AGE, WEIGHT, GENDER, RACE, BASELINE METHOTREXATE USE, PSORIASIS Â‰¥3% BODY SURFACE AREA, BASELINE PASI SCORE, PRESENCE OF DACTYLITIS AND ENTHESITIS, AND HAQ-DI) MATCHED THOSE IN THE FUTURE TRIALS.

THE MEAN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ADALIMUMAB AND SECUKINUMAB 150Â MG IN RELATIVE ACR 20/50/70 AND PASI 75/90 RESPONSE RATES WERE 9.5, 3.0, 6.0, 13.1, AND 6.7%, RESPECTIVELY (PÂ >Â 0.05 FOR ALL COMPARISONS). POST-MATCH RELATIVE ACR 20/50/70 AND PASI 75 TO PLACEBO WERE ALSO HIGHER WITH ADALIMUMAB COMPARED TO SECUKINUMAB 300Â MG.

A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO COMPARE ADJACENT-LEVEL DEGENERATION (ALD) OUTCOMES BETWEEN TDR AND FUSION. FUSION IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH RATES OF ALD IN SYMPTOMATIC LUMBAR DISC DEGENERATION. TDR MAY REDUCE THIS RISK. IN TOTAL, 175 PATIENTS WITH SINGLE-LEVEL, SYMPTOMATIC, LUMBAR DISC DEGENERATION WHO HAD RECEIVED ACTIVL OR PRODISC-L AND HAD A PREOPERATIVE AND 5-YEAR POSTOPERATIVE RADIOGRAPH AVAILABLE WERE INCLUDED.

NIVOLUMAB-IPILIMUMAB WAS THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE OPTION IN THE BASE CASE ANALYSIS WITH AN ICER OF $34,190/QALY COMPARED WITH SUNITINIB, WHILE THE PEMBROLIZUMAB-AXITINIB ICER WAS DOMINATED BY NIVOLUMAB-IPILIMUMAB AND WAS NOT COST-EFFECTIVE (ICER=$12,630,828/QALY) COMPARED WITH SUNITINIB. THE MEAN TOTAL COSTS PER PATIENT FOR THE NIVOLUMAB-IPILIMUMAB AND PEMBROLIZUMAB-AXITINIB ARMS WERE $284,683 AND $457,769, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH SUNITINIB AT $241,656. QALY WAS LONGER FOR NIVOLUMAB-IPILIMUMAB (3.23 QALY) THAN FOR ADJUSTED PEMBROLIZUMAB-AXITINIB (1.99 QALY), WHICH WAS LONGER THAN SUNITINIB'S (1.98 QALY). THESE RESULTS WERE MOST SENSITIVE TO TREATMENT COST IN BOTH GROUPS, BUT PLAUSIBLE CHANGES DID NOT ALTER THE CONCLUSIONS.

TETRABENAZINE WAS ASSESSED FOR TREATING CHOREA IN THE TETRA-HD TRIAL, AND WHILE EFFICACIOUS, THERE ARE TOLERABILITY CONCERNS POSSIBLY DUE TO ITS PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES. DEUTETRABENAZINE IS A NOVEL VMAT2 INHIBITOR THAT CONTAINS DEUTERIUM, WHICH EXTENDS ACTIVE METABOLITE HALF-LIVES AND MINIMIZES DRUG CONCENTRATION FLUCTUATIONS. IN THE FIRST-HD TRIAL, DEUTETRABENAZINE WAS EFFICACIOUS IN TREATING CHOREA AND WAS GENERALLY WELL TOLERATED. IN THE ABSENCE OF A HEAD-TO-HEAD TRIAL, WE PERFORMED AN INDIRECT TREATMENT COMPARISON (ITC) OF THE TOLERABILITY OF DEUTETRABENAZINE AND TETRABENAZINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF HD-ASSOCIATED CHOREA, AS OBSERVED IN THE FIRST-HD AND TETRA-HD TRIALS, USING WELL-ESTABLISHED COMPARISON METHODS. DATA FROM THE PHASE III, 12-WEEK, PARALLEL-GROUP, CLINICAL TRIALS FIRST-HD ( Â€‰=Â€‰90) AND TETRA-HD ( Â€‰=Â€‰84) WERE USED TO CONDUCT AN ITC OF THE TOLERABILITY OF DEUTETRABENAZINE VERSUS TETRABENAZINE USING TWO ANCHOR-BASED METHODS: BUCHER COMPARISON FOR UNADJUSTED ITCS, AND MATCHING INDIRECT COMPARISON FOR ADJUSTED ITCS. OVERALL ADVERSE EVENTS (AES; MILD, MODERATE, AND SEVERE), SERIOUS AES, SPECIFIC AES OCCURRING IN Â‰¥10% OF PATIENTS, AND DISCONTINUATIONS (ALL-CAUSE AND AE-RELATED) WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE RISK DIFFERENCES OF THESE OUTCOMES FOR DEUTETRABENAZINE AND TETRABENAZINE WERE ESTIMATED BY SUBTRACTING THE APPLICABLE PLACEBO-ADJUSTED RISK IN FIRST-HD FROM THAT OF TETRA-HD. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO ADDRESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TRIALS, AND  -VALUES WERE OBTAINED FROM Z-TESTS. COMPARED WITH TETRABENAZINE, DEUTETRABENAZINE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RISK OF MODERATE TO SEVERE AES AND NEUROPSYCHIATRIC AES INCLUDING AGITATION, AKATHISIA, DEPRESSION, DEPRESSION/AGITATED DEPRESSION, DROWSINESS/SOMNOLENCE, INSOMNIA, AND PARKINSONISM IN BOTH ADJUSTED AND UNADJUSTED ANALYSES ( Â€‰<Â€‰0.05 FOR EACH). DEUTETRABENAZINE HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATE OF DOSE REDUCTION OR DOSE REDUCTION/SUSPENSION IN THE UNADJUSTED AND ADJUSTED ANALYSES ( Â€‰<Â€‰0.001 FOR EACH). DEUTETRABENAZINE RESULTED IN NUMERICALLY MORE MILD AES, SUCH AS DIARRHEA AND COUGHING; HOWEVER, THESE RESULTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THIS INDIRECT TREATMENT COMPARISON DEMONSTRATES THAT FOR THE TREATMENT OF HD CHOREA, DEUTETRABENAZINE HAS A FAVORABLE TOLERABILITY PROFILE COMPARED TO TETRABENAZINE.
