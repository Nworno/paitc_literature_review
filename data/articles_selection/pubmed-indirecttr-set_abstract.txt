TI  - Geometric approaches to assessing the numerical feasibility for conducting 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparisons.
LID - 10.1002/pst.2210 [doi]
AB  - We discuss how to handle matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) from a data 
      analyst's perspective. We introduce several multivariate data analysis methods to 
      assess the appropriateness of MAIC for a given set of baseline characteristics. 
      These methods focus on comparing the baseline variables used in the matching of a 
      study that provides the summary statistics or aggregated data (AD) and a study that 
      provides individual patient level data (IPD). The methods identify situations when 
      no numerical solutions are possible with the MAIC method. This helps to avoid 
      misleading results being produced. Moreover, it has been observed that sometimes 
      contradicting results are reported by two sets of MAIC analyses produced by two 
      teams, each having their own IPD and applying MAIC using the AD published by the 
      other team. We show that an intrinsic property of the MAIC estimated weights can be 
      a contributing factor for this phenomenon.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell 
      therapies for third-line or later treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell 
      lymphoma: lisocabtagene maraleucel versus tisagenlecleucel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no head-to-head clinical studies comparing chimeric antigen 
      receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies for the treatment of relapsed or refractory 
      aggressive large B-cell lymphomas. Naive, indirect comparisons may be inappropriate, 
      as the study designs and patient populations could differ substantially. 
      Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC) can reduce many biases associated with 
      indirect comparisons between studies. To determine the comparative efficacy and 
      safety of lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) to tisagenlecleucel, we describe an 
      unanchored MAIC of the pivotal studies TRANSCEND NHL 001 (TRANSCEND; NCT02631044; 
      liso-cel) and JULIET (NCT02445248; tisagenlecleucel). METHODS: Individual patient 
      data (IPD) from TRANSCEND were available to the authors; for the JULIET pivotal 
      study, summary-level data from the published study were used. To balance the 
      populations between two studies, IPD from TRANSCEND were adjusted to match the 
      marginal distribution (e.g., mean, variance) of clinical factors among patients from 
      JULIET. RESULTS: Results from the primary MAIC showed liso-cel had statistically 
      significant greater efficacy than tisagenlecleucel (objective response rate: odds 
      ratio [OR] = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63‒4.74; complete response rate: 
      OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22‒3.30; progression-free survival: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65, 
      95% CI: 0.47‒0.91; overall survival: HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47‒0.95). MAIC of safety 
      outcomes showed lower ORs for all-grade and grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome, and 
      grade ≥ 3 prolonged cytopenia for liso-cel when compared with tisagenlecleucel; 
      there were no statistically significant differences detected for other safety 
      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this MAIC of two CAR T-cell therapies indicates 
      liso-cel had favorable efficacy and a comparable or better safety profile relative 
      to tisagenlecleucel. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: 
      NCT02631044 and NCT02445248.

TI  - Carfilzomib 56 mg/m(2) twice-weekly in combination with dexamethasone and 
      daratumumab (KdD) versus daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and 
      dexamethasone (DVd): a matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/10428194.2022.2047962 [doi]
AB  - Given the increasing use of frontline lenalidomide-based therapies in multiple 
      myeloma (MM), there is an emerging need for lenalidomide-sparing regimens at 
      relapse. Carfilzomib plus dexamethasone and daratumumab (KdD) and daratumumab plus 
      bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) are lenalidomide-sparing triplet regimens that 
      are approved for relapsed and/or refractory MM (R/RMM). In the absence of a 
      head-to-head trial comparing these treatments, a matching-adjusted indirect 
      treatment comparison (MAIC) was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of KdD 
      versus DVd. Results showed that treatment with KdD decreases the risk of progression 
      or death versus DVd (HR 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.90). 
      Time-dependent analysis demonstrated a larger benefit for KdD after the first eight 
      cycles. Unmatched subgroup analysis indicated that KdD may be particularly effective 
      in lenalidomide-exposed and -refractory patients. The present analysis suggests that 
      KdD improves outcomes compared with DVd in patients with R/RMM and may provide a 
      rationale for a preferential treatment.

TI  - Eluxadoline Versus Antispasmodics in the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: An 
      Adjusted Indirect Treatment Comparison Meta-analysis.
PG  - 757969

LID - 757969
AB  - Objective: Eluxadoline is a newly approved drug for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 
      but it has rarely been compared with positive controls. We aimed to compare 
      eluxadoline with antispasmodics in the treatment of IBS. Methods: We searched the 
      OVID Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing eluxadoline or 
      antispasmodics with placebo. The search was conducted from 1 January 1980, to 1 
      September 2020, without any language restrictions. The primary efficacy outcome was 
      the relief of abdominal pain, defined by a reduction of pain scores of at least 30% 
      from baseline. The secondary efficacy outcome was the relief of global IBS symptoms, 
      defined by a composite response of a decrease in abdominal pain and improvement in 
      stool consistency on the same day for at least 50% of the days assessed. The data 
      were pooled using a random-effects model. Outcome estimates were pooled by using 
      Risk Ratios (RRs) and P-scores. Results: Forty-two trials with 8,457 participants 
      were included from 45 articles. Compared with placebo, each of drotaverine, 
      pinaverium, alverine combined with simethicone (ACS) and eluxadoline 100 mg was 
      highly effective in the relief of abdominal pain, with drotaverine [RR, 2.71 (95% 
      CI, 1.70 to 4.32), P-score = 0.95] ranking first. Drotaverine, otilonium, 
      cimetropium, pinaverium, and eluxadoline 100 mg had significantly high the relief of 
      global IBS symptomss, for which drotaverine [RR, 2.45 (95% CI, 1.42 to 4.22), 
      P-score = 0.95] was ranked first. No significant difference was found between these 
      interventions. Pinaverium had a significantly higher the relief of global IBS 
      symptoms than eluxadoline [RR, 1.72 (95% CI, 1.33 to 2.21)] on sensitivity analysis. 
      However, no significant difference was found in the number of adverse events between 
      each intervention and the placebo. Conclusion: Our network meta-analysis showed that 
      eluxadoline 100 mg was at least as effective as antispasmodics in relieving 
      abdominal pain in IBS. But eluxadoline had more reported adverse events. 
      Antispasmodics are still the first choice for the treatment of IBS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare 30-day mortality among patients receiving the specific reversal 
      agent andexanet alfa versus replacement prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in the 
      management of direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC)-related bleeds. METHODS: Two 
      patient-level datasets were used: ANNEXA-4, a prospective, single-arm trial of 
      patients taking apixaban or rivaroxaban who received andexanet alfa and ORANGE, a 
      prospective, observational study of anticoagulated patients in UK hospitals, some of 
      whom received PCC. Patients were propensity score matched based on demographic and 
      clinical characteristics. Subgroup analyses were performed by bleed type 
      (intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], gastrointestinal [GI], other). Relative risk (RR) of 
      all-cause 30-day mortality was calculated. RESULTS: 322 ANNEXA-4 patients treated 
      with andexanet alfa (mean age = 77.7 years; 64.9% ICH) were matched with 88 ORANGE 
      patients treated with PCC (mean age = 74.9 years, 67.1% ICH). Adjusted 30-day 
      mortality for patients treated with andexanet alfa (14.6%) was lower than patients 
      treated with PCC (34.1%; RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.29-0.63). In the ICH subgroup, patients 
      treated with andexanet alfa had lower mortality (15.3%) than patients treated with 
      PCC (48.9%; RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.20-0.48). Mortality risk was lowest for patients in 
      the GI subgroup but did not differ significantly by treatment (12.2% for andexanet 
      alfa vs 25.0% for PCC; RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.21-1.16). CONCLUSIONS: In this propensity 
      score-matched comparison across 2 independent datasets, adjusted 30-day mortality 
      rates were lower for patients treated with andexanet alfa than in matched patients 
      receiving PCC. This indirect comparison was limited in that it could not account for 
      several highly predictive variables including GCS score, hematoma volume, and 
      expected survival. Further research is warranted to confirm the mortality 
      differences between reversal/replacement agents for DOAC-related bleeding.

TI  - Transarterial Radioembolization Versus Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab in Unresectable 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Time to 
      Deterioration in Quality of Life.
LID - 10.1007/s12325-022-02099-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Given the relatively short life expectancy of patients with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), quality of life (QOL) plays a significant role in 
      treatment selection. This analysis aimed to compare time to deterioration (TTD) in 
      QOL with transarterial radioembolization (TARE) and atezolizumab-bevacizumab, as 
      well as sorafenib, in advanced and unresectable HCC. METHODS: Patient-level data 
      from SARAH (TARE using SIR-Spheres(®) Y-90 resin microspheres [SIR-Spheres] versus 
      sorafenib) and aggregate data from IMbrave150 (atezolizumab-bevacizumab versus 
      sorafenib) randomized controlled trials were used to conduct an anchored 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). Patients with a Child-Pugh score B in 
      SARAH were excluded to align with exclusion criteria in IMbrave150. To identify 
      potential effect modifiers for adjustment, the literature was searched and 
      multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were implemented using SARAH data. 
      Patients from SARAH were then weighted to balance with baseline characteristics from 
      IMbrave150. Median TTD in QOL and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated. RESULTS: Four 
      potential effect modifiers were identified and used for adjustment: cause of disease 
      (viral/non-viral), macrovascular invasion, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
      performance score, and alpha-fetoprotein level. The MAIC included 217 patients from 
      SARAH (TARE = 94; sorafenib = 123). Median TTD in QOL was 11.23 and 8.64 months for 
      atezolizumab-bevacizumab and TARE, respectively (HR = 1.06; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 0.75-1.50; p = 0.725). A sensitivity analysis was conducted adjusting for cause 
      of disease defined as hepatitis B/hepatitis C/non-viral: median TTD in QOL was 
      higher for TARE compared with atezolizumab-bevacizumab (19.88 vs 11.23 months; 
      HR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.36-1.19; p = 0.163). Sorafenib resulted in the shortest TTD in 
      QOL, with statistically significant differences in both base case and sensitivity 
      analyses. CONCLUSION: TARE using SIR-Spheres may achieve similar TTD in QOL compared 
      with atezolizumab-bevacizumab, as the analyses found no statistically significant 
      differences between these two interventions. Both TARE using SIR-Spheres and 
      atezolizumab-bevacizumab seem to be more efficacious than sorafenib in maintaining 
      QOL.

OAB - For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as physicians treating 
      hepatocellular carcinoma, the quality of life that different treatments can offer 
      represents an increasingly important aspect to consider when choosing treatments. 
      Transarterial radioembolization and atezolizumab–bevacizumab are two potential 
      treatments for advanced and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, but no clinical 
      trials have directly compared the outcomes of these two therapeutic options. With 
      the data available (patient-level data from a clinical trial of transarterial 
      radioembolization using SIR-Spheres(®) Y-90 resin microspheres [SIR-Spheres] versus 
      sorafenib and data from a trial of atezolizumab–bevacizumab versus sorafenib from 
      the literature), this study indirectly compared the time to deterioration of quality 
      of life (i.e., how long quality of life is maintained) after treatment with 
      transarterial radioembolization and atezolizumab–bevacizumab. The study showed that 
      quality of life may be preserved over a similar time period with transarterial 
      radioembolization using SIR-Spheres and atezolizumab–bevacizumab; also, both 
      transarterial radioembolization using SIR-Spheres and atezolizumab–bevacizumab seem 
      to maintain patients’ quality of life over a longer period of time compared with 
      sorafenib. These results are expected to enrich the existing evidence on which 
      patients and physicians can base their decisions, allowing them to choose the most 
      appropriate treatment by assessing the treatments’ characteristics as a whole.

TI  - Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for adults with ADHD: protocol 
      for a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - e058102

LID - e058102
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is unclear how pharmacological and non-pharmacological 
      interventions compare with each other in terms of efficacy and tolerability for core 
      symptoms and additional problems in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD). We aim to conduct the first network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing 
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (or their combinations) in 
      adults with ADHD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for NMAs. We will search 
      a broad set of electronic databases/registries and contact drug companies and 
      experts in the field to retrieve published and unpublished randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) (parallel or cross-over) of medications (either licensed or 
      unlicensed) and any non-pharmacological intervention in adults (≥18 years) with 
      ADHD. Primary outcomes will be: (1) change in severity of ADHD core symptoms, and 
      (2) acceptability (all-cause discontinuation). Secondary outcomes will include 
      tolerability (drop-out due to side effects) and change in the severity of emotional 
      dysregulation, executive dysfunctions and quality of life. The risk of bias in each 
      individual RCT included in the NMA will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 
      tool-version 2. We will evaluate the transitivity assumption comparing the 
      distribution of possible effect modifiers across treatment comparisons. We will 
      perform Bayesian NMA for each outcome with random-effects model in OpenBUGS. Pooled 
      estimates of NMA will be obtained using the Markov Chains Monte Carlo method. We 
      will judge the credibility in the evidence derived from the NMA using the CINeMA 
      tool (which includes assessment of publication bias). We will conduct a series of 
      sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: As this is the protocol for an aggregate-data level NMA, ethical 
      approval will not be required. Results will be disseminated at 
      national/international conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. PROSPERO 
      REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021265576.

TI  - Comparison of Different Biologics for Treating Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal 
      Polyps: A Network Analysis.
LID - S2213-2198(22)00235-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jaip.2022.02.034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several promising clinical trials have demonstrated the effects of type 
      2 biologics compared with placebos in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
      (CRSwNP). However, there are no head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      between the biologics. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of different 
      biologics used for the treatment of CRSwNP. METHODS: We systematically identified 
      RCTs investigating the effects of biologics for CRSwNP. Primary outcomes were nasal 
      polyp score (NPS), nasal congestion severity, and serious adverse events. Secondary 
      outcomes included the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score, loss of smell 
      severity, the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test score, and the 
      Lund-Mackay computed tomography score. Bucher indirect treatment comparison (ITC) 
      was used to compare the outcome parameters. RESULTS: Seven RCTs (Bachert 2017, 
      OSTRO, POLYP 1, POLYP 2, SINUS-24, SINUS-52, and SYNAPSE) involving 1913 patients 
      and 4 biologics (benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, and omalizumab) were included 
      for ITC. Dupilumab presented better effects in decreasing NPS and nasal congestion 
      severity compared with the other 3 biologics at 24 weeks of the treatment and at the 
      end of follow-up (more than 48 weeks). Benralizumab was the least effective in 
      reducing nasal congestion severity and SNOT-22 score at 24 weeks. No significant 
      differences were observed between the effects of the other biologics. CONCLUSION: 
      Our current findings suggest that dupilumab exhibits the best efficacy and safety 
      for the treatment of CRSwNP.

TI  - Feasibility Study of a Network Meta-Analysis and Unanchored Population-Adjusted 
      Indirect Treatment Comparison of Niraparib, Olaparib, and Bevacizumab as Maintenance 
      Therapies in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Advanced Ovarian Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14051285 [doi]
LID - 1285
AB  - Selecting a first-line (1L) maintenance option for ovarian cancer is challenging 
      given the variety of therapies, differing trials, and the lack of head-to-head data 
      for angiogenesis and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Thus, indirect 
      treatment comparisons (ITCs) can aid treatment decision making. This study assessed 
      the feasibility of two ITCs, a network meta-analysis (NMA) and a population-adjusted 
      ITC (PAIC), comparing the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor niraparib in the PRIMA 
      trial (NCT02655016) with other 1L maintenance treatments. A systematic literature 
      review was conducted to identify trials using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic 
      Reviews of Interventions to assess differences in trial design, population 
      characteristics, treatment arms, and outcome measures. All 12 trials identified were 
      excluded from the NMA due to the absence of a common comparator and differences in 
      survival measures and/or inclusion criteria. The PAIC comparing PRIMA and PAOLA-1 
      trials was also not feasible due to differences in inclusion criteria, survival 
      measures, and the previous receipt of chemotherapy/bevacizumab. Neither ITC met 
      recommended guidelines for analysis; the results of such comparisons would not be 
      considered appropriate evidence when selecting 1L maintenance options in ovarian 
      cancer. ITCs in this setting should be performed cautiously, as many factors can 
      preclude objective trial comparisons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Results of CheckMate 577 show an improved disease-free survival for 
      patients with resected esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer treated with 
      adjuvant nivolumab compared with placebo (22.4 versus 11.0 months). Population-based 
      data can provide insights in outcomes from clinical practice. The aim of our study 
      was to investigate disease-free and overall survival in a nationwide population 
      aligned with the inclusion criteria of CheckMate 577. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Resected 
      patients with stage II/III esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer 
      (2015-2016) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were selected from the 
      Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients with cervical esophageal cancer, irradical 
      resection, or complete pathological response were excluded. Disease-free and overall 
      survival were assessed from 12 weeks after resection using Kaplan-Meier methods. In 
      addition, to adjust for differences in characteristics between CheckMate 577 and our 
      population-based cohort, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison was performed for 
      pathological lymph node status and pathological tumor status. RESULTS: We identified 
      634 patients. Sixty percent of patients were diagnosed with recurrence or were 
      deceased at the end of follow-up. Median disease-free survival was 19.7 months and 
      median overall survival was 32.2 months. After the matching procedure, the median 
      disease-free survival was 17.2 months and median overall survival was 28.2 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Disease-free survival in our population-based study was considerably 
      longer than the placebo population of CheckMate-577 (19.7 versus 11.0 months). 
      Possible explanations are differences in characteristics, quality of esophageal 
      cancer care, or differential strategies for evaluation of recurrence. In the 
      Netherlands postoperative imaging is not part of the standard follow-up as opposed 
      to the standard postoperative imaging in the CheckMate 577 trial. The difference in 
      postoperative imaging could partially explain the longer disease-free survival 
      observed in our study. Quality and optimization of current treatment modalities 
      remain important aspects of esophageal cancer care.

TI  - Effectiveness of crizotinib versus entrectinib in ROS1-positive non-small-cell lung 
      cancer using clinical and real-world data.
LID - 10.2217/fon-2021-1102 [doi]
AB  - Aims: To compare clinical trial results for crizotinib and entrectinib in 
      ROS1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer and compare clinical trial data and 
      real-world outcomes for crizotinib. Patients & methods: We analyzed four phase I-II 
      studies using a simulated treatment comparison (STC). A STC of clinical trial versus 
      real-world evidence compared crizotinib clinical data to real-world outcomes. 
      Results: Adjusted STC found nonsignificant trends favoring crizotinib over 
      entrectinib: objective response rate, risk ratio = 1.04 (95% CI: 0.85-1.28); median 
      duration of response, mean difference = 16.11 months (95% CI: -1.57- 33.69); median 
      progression-free survival, mean difference = 3.99 months (95% CI: -6.27-14.25); 
      12-month overall survival, risk ratio = 1.01 (95% CI: 0.90-1.12). Nonsignificant 
      differences were observed between the trial end point values and the real-world 
      evidence for crizotinib. Conclusions: Crizotinib and entrectinib have comparable 
      efficacy in ROS1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.

PG  - 975-995

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Information about the long-term survival impact of hematopoietic stem 
      cell transplant (HSCT) in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
      leukaemia is limited. The objective was to conduct a systematic review identifying 
      studies reporting survival in HSCT-receiving patients and apply parametric analyses 
      to predict long-term survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five relevant studies 
      were identified. Analyses were conducted in 10 studies (n=503; "global" analysis) 
      reporting overall survival (OS) data as Kaplan-Meier curves or at patient level. 
      Four studies (n=217; "subgroup" analysis) measured OS from the point of HSCT. 
      Patient-level data were recreated from Kaplan-Meier curves and pooled, with six 
      models tested for longer-term extrapolation. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis 
      was undertaken involving removal of data from the oldest study cohort (recruited 
      between 1981-1997) to determine if the year which patients received HSCT impacted 
      survival compared to post-2009 data. RESULTS: Median OS and five-year survival 
      probability were 11.4 months and 24.4% (95% CI, 20.5-28.5%) in the global analysis, 
      and 12.0 months and 28.4% (95% CI, 22.1-34.9%) in the subgroup analysis. The 
      generalised gamma and Gompertz models fit longer-term extrapolation criteria. The 
      generalised gamma model predicted survival at 10.4% vs. 14.8% (15 years), 8.3% vs. 
      12.8% (20 years), and 6.9% vs. 11.4% (25 years) for the global and subgroup 
      analysis, respectively. The Gompertz model predicted survival to plateau at 23% vs. 
      25.6% just before 10 years. The sensitivity analysis excluding older data found 
      median survival increased two-fold (25.3 vs. 12 months). CONCLUSIONS: Results 
      synthesize long-term evidence of outcomes for HSCT-receiving patients, providing a 
      basis for treatment comparison. Risk of death is low beyond four years and newer 
      data appears correlated with improved outcomes.

TI  - Proptosis and Diplopia Response With Teprotumumab and Placebo vs the Recommended 
      Treatment Regimen With Intravenous Methylprednisolone in Moderate to Severe Thyroid 
      Eye Disease: A Meta-analysis and Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison.
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.6284 [doi]
LID - e216284
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Thyroid eye disease can be a debilitating autoimmune disorder 
      characterized by progressive proptosis or diplopia. Teprotumumab has been compared 
      with placebo in randomized clinical trials, but not with intravenous 
      methylprednisolone (IVMP), which sometimes is used in clinical practice for this 
      condition. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of 
      teprotumumab vs IVMP vs placebo. DATA SOURCES: Deidentified patient-level data from 
      teprotumumab trials and aggregate-level data from literature on the most recommended 
      regimen of IVMP. STUDY SELECTION: PubMed and Embase were searched for 
      randomized/observational studies using key terms and controlled vocabulary. Full 
      texts of eligible articles were reviewed and cataloged. DATA EXTRACTION AND 
      SYNTHESIS: Conducted by 1 reviewer (R.A.Q.) and 1 verifier (R.B.), including study 
      characteristics, eligibility criteria, baseline characteristics, and outcomes. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in proptosis by millimeter and diplopia response 
      (percentage with ≥1 grade reduction) from baseline to week 12 in patients receiving 
      IVMP and placebo, and to week 24 in patients receiving teprotumumab. RESULTS: The 
      search identified 1019 records, and 6 through manual searches, alerts, and secondary 
      references. After excluding duplicates and screening full-text records, 12 IVMP 
      studies were included in the matching-adjusted indirect comparison (11 for proptosis 
      change [n = 419], 4 for diplopia response [n = 125], and 2 teprotumumab [n = 79] and 
      placebo [n = 83] comparator studies). Treatment with IVMP resulted in a proptosis 
      difference of -0.16 mm (95% CI, -1.55 to 1.22 mm) from baseline to week 12 vs 
      placebo. The proptosis treatment difference between IVMP and teprotumumab of -2.31 
      mm (95% CI, -3.45 to -1.17 mm) favored teprotumumab. Treatment with IVMP (odds 
      ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 0.94-7.70) was not favored over placebo in odds of diplopia 
      response; however, teprotumumab was favored over IVMP (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 
      1.07-5.03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis suggests that use of IVMP 
      is associated with a small, typically not clinically relevant, change from baseline 
      in proptosis vs placebo, with modest changes in diplopia. While this nonrandomized 
      comparison suggests that use of teprotumumab, compared with IVMP, is associated with 
      greater improvements in proptosis and may be twice as likely to have a 1 grade or 
      higher reduction in diplopia, randomized trials comparing these 2 treatments would 
      be warranted to determine if 1 treatment is superior to the other to a clinically 
      relevant degree.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel vs. Tisagenlecleucel for the 
      Management of Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in Spain.

AB  - The study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of axicabtagene ciloleucel 
      (axi-cel) vs. tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory 
      (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after ≥2 lines of systemic therapy in 
      Spain. A lifetime partitioned survival mixture cure model, which comprises 
      pre-progression, post-progression, and death health states, was used to estimate the 
      accumulated costs and outcomes in terms of life years gained (LYG) and 
      quality-adjusted life years (QALY). A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was used 
      to reweight patient-level data from ZUMA-1, the pivotal clinical trial for axi-cel, 
      to aggregate-level data from the pivotal tisa-cel trial, JULIET. The analysis was 
      performed from the National Health System perspective, thus only direct costs were 
      included. Sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed. Axi-cel yielded 2.74 incremental 
      LYG and 2.31 additional QALY gained per patient compared to tisa-cel. Total 
      incremental lifetime costs for axi-cel versus tisa-cel were €30,135/patient. The 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of axi-cel versus tisa-cel resulted in 
      €10,999/LYG and the incremental cost-utility ratio in €13,049/QALY gained. SA proved 
      robustness of the results. Considering the frequently assumed willingness-to-pay 
      thresholds in Spain (€22,000/QALY and €60,000/QALY), axi-cel is a cost-effective 
      treatment vs. tisa-cel for adult patients with R/R DLBCL in Spain.

TI  - A Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Single-Arm Trials in Patients with 
      Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma Who Received at Least Two Prior Systemic 
      Treatments: Tazemetostat was Associated with a Lower Risk for Safety Outcomes Versus 
      the PI3-Kinase Inhibitors Idelalisib, Duvelisib, Copanlisib, and Umbralisib.
LID - 10.1007/s12325-022-02054-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tazemetostat is an enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitor 
      recommended for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) 
      after demonstrating single-agent, antitumor activity in patients with wild-type or 
      mutant EZH2. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors idelalisib, copanlisib, 
      umbralisib and (formerly) duvelisib are indicated for third-line, fourth-line, and 
      later (3L/4L+) treatment of R/R FL. The objective of this analysis was to provide an 
      indirect treatment comparison of tazemetostat with each PI3K inhibitor for 3L/4L+ 
      R/R FL treatment. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify 
      trials for idelalisib (DELTA), duvelisib (DYNAMO), copanlisib (CHRONOS-1 Part B), 
      and umbralisib (UNITY-NHL) in 3L+ R/R FL. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons 
      were conducted by weighting tazemetostat individual patient data with available 
      baseline characteristics from each comparator trial: age, Eastern Cooperative 
      Oncology Group performance status, disease stage, histology, prior treatment lines, 
      prior stem cell therapy, progression within 24 months, and refractory status to last 
      therapy. Only the tazemetostat trial included patients with grade 3b or transformed 
      FL, or recorded EZH2 mutation status. Primary safety outcomes included risk of 
      grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); primary efficacy outcomes 
      included objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Matched patients treated with 
      tazemetostat had lower relative risk (RR) for all grouped safety outcomes, including 
      any grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, compared with idelalisib (RR = 0.45), duvelisib (RR = 0.35), 
      copanlisib (RR = 0.37), and umbralisib (RR = 0.65; all, p < 0.01), any serious TEAE, 
      and any TEAE leading to dose reduction, drug discontinuation, or interruption. The 
      ORR was not significantly different for tazemetostat versus other treatments 
      (idelalisib 43% vs 56%, p = 0.16; duvelisib 48% vs 47%, p = 0.91; copanlisib 49% vs 
      61%, p = 0.11; and umbralisib 57% vs 47%, p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      statistically adjusted comparison, tazemetostat was associated with lower RR for 
      safety outcomes versus idelalisib, duvelisib, copanlisib, and umbralisib, while 
      achieving similar efficacy outcomes.

TI  - Oral Antihypertensives for Nonsevere Pregnancy Hypertension: Systematic Review, 
      Network Meta- and Trial Sequential Analyses.
PG  - 614-628
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18415 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to address which antihypertensives are superior to placebo/no 
      therapy or another antihypertensive for controlling nonsevere pregnancy hypertension 
      and provide future sample size estimates for definitive evidence. METHODS: 
      Randomized trials of antihypertensives for nonsevere pregnancy hypertension were 
      identified from online electronic databases, to February 28, 2021 (registration URL: 
      https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/; unique identifier: CRD42020188725). Our 
      outcomes were severe hypertension, proteinuria/preeclampsia, fetal/newborn death, 
      small-for-gestational age infants, preterm birth, and admission to neonatal care. A 
      Bayesian random-effects model generated estimates of direct and indirect treatment 
      comparisons. Trial sequential analysis informed future trials needed. RESULTS: Of 
      1246 publications identified, 72 trials were included; 61 (6923 women) were 
      informative. All commonly prescribed antihypertensives (labetalol, other β-blockers, 
      methyldopa, calcium channel blockers, and mixed/multi-drug therapy) versus 
      placebo/no therapy reduced the risk of severe hypertension by 30% to 70%. Labetalol 
      decreased proteinuria/preeclampsia (odds ratio, 0.73 [95% credible interval, 
      0.54-0.99]) and fetal/newborn death (odds ratio, 0.54 [0.30-0.98]) compared with 
      placebo/no therapy, and proteinuria/preeclampsia compared with methyldopa (odds 
      ratio, 0.66 [0.44-0.99]) and calcium channel blockers (odds ratio, 0.63 
      [0.41-0.96]). No other differences were identified, but credible intervals were 
      wide. Trial sequential analysis indicated that 2500 to 10 000 women/arm (severe 
      hypertension or safety outcomes) to >15 000/arm (fetal/newborn death) would be 
      required to provide definitive evidence. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, all commonly 
      prescribed antihypertensives in pregnancy reduce the risk of severe hypertension, 
      but labetalol may also decrease proteinuria/preeclampsia and fetal/newborn death. 
      Evidence is lacking for many other safety outcomes. Prohibitive sample sizes are 
      required for definitive evidence. Real-world data are needed to individualize care.

TI  - A Method for Reconstructing Individual Patient Data From Kaplan-Meier Survival 
      Curves That Incorporate Marked Censoring Times.

AB  - Introduction. Access to individual patient data (IPD) can be advantageous when 
      conducting cost-effectiveness analyses or indirect treatment comparisons. While 
      exact times of censoring are often marked on published Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, an 
      algorithm for reconstructing IPD from such curves that allows for their 
      incorporation is presently unavailable. Methods. An algorithm capable of 
      incorporating marked censoring times was developed to reconstruct IPD from KM 
      curves, taking as additional inputs the total patient count and coordinates of the 
      drops in survival. The reliability of the algorithm was evaluated via a simulation 
      exercise, in which survival curves were simulated, digitized, and then 
      reconstructed. To assess the reliability of the reconstructed curves, hazard ratios 
      (HRs) and quantiles of survival were compared between the original and reconstructed 
      curves, and the reconstructed curves were visually inspected. Results. No systematic 
      differences were found in HRs and quantiles in the original versus reconstructed 
      curves. Upon visual inspection, the reconstructed IPD provided a close fit to the 
      digitized data from the published KM curves. Inherent to the algorithm, censoring 
      times were incorporated into the reconstructed data exactly as specified. 
      Conclusion. This new algorithm can reliably be used to reconstruct IPD from reported 
      KM survival curves in the presence of extractable censoring times. Use of the 
      algorithm will allow health researchers to reconstruct IPD more closely by 
      incorporating censoring times exactly as marked, requiring as additional inputs the 
      total patient count and coordinates of the drops in survival.

LID - 10.2217/fon-2021-1509 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This research aimed to compare the relative efficacy of avapritinib 
      versus midostaurin for patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis. Method: A 
      systematic literature review was performed to identify relevant evidence. Unanchored 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were conducted for overall survival (OS), 
      overall response rate (ORR) and complete remission (CR). Results: The systematic 
      literature review identified the clinical trials EXPLORER and PATHFINDER 
      (investigating avapritinib) and D2201 and A2213 (investigating midostaurin). The 
      avapritinib versus midostaurin adjusted hazard ratio for OS was 0.44 (95% CI: 
      0.25-0.76), and the adjusted odds ratios for ORR and CR were 4.06 (95% CI: 
      3.09-5.33) and 9.56 (95% CI: 0.97-93.81), respectively. Conclusion: The results 
      suggest that avapritinib improves survival and response (ORR and CR) compared with 
      midostaurin.

OAB - Plain language summary Systemic mastocytosisis a rare blood disorder caused by the 
      build-up of too many abnormal mast cells, a type of white blood cell, in the skin 
      and organs. Patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis have a low life expectancy 
      and limited treatment options. This research aimed to compare the effectiveness of 
      two recent and innovative treatments (called avapritinib and midostaurin) in 
      extending life expectancy and decreasing mast cells and organ damage. As avapritinib 
      and midostaurin were not investigated in the same clinical studies, it was necessary 
      to compare the two treatments using the results from studies of each individual 
      treatment. The published evidence used to support this comparison was systematically 
      searched for and consisted of four clinical studies: the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER 
      studies (investigating avapritinib) and D2201 and A2213 studies (investigating 
      midostaurin). An indirect comparison between the studies was made that adjusted for 
      differences in key patient characteristics. The results suggest that compared with 
      midostaurin, avapritinib has the potential to extend life expectancy and decrease 
      disease burden.

TI  - Effect of pretreatment with dexamethasone on the efficacy and immune-related adverse 
      events of immunotherapy in first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung 
      cancer: a network meta-analysis of randomized control trials.
PG  - 93-102
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pretreatment of dexamethasone on the efficacy and immune-related 
      adverse events of immunotherapy involving programmed cell death 1/programmed cell 
      death 1 ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) inhibitors is an effective option for the first-line 
      treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). With the immunosuppressive 
      effect, corticosteroids may be used to reduce the efficacy of PDL1 blockade, as well 
      as prevent overactive immune responses, thereby reducing the occurrence of 
      immune-related adverse events (irAEs). This study quantitatively summarized the 
      current evidence, and compared the efficacy and toxicity of therapies involving 
      chemotherapy plus PDL1 inhibitors plus dexamethasone pretreatment (I+C+D) with 
      chemotherapy plus PDL1 inhibitors (I+C) and therapies involving PDL1 inhibitors or 
      chemotherapy alone (I or C). METHODS: The protocol of this study was registered with 
      PROSPERO (CRD42021227281). By using a network meta-analysis approach, the different 
      treatments were compared and ranked based on their effectiveness and rates of irAEs 
      at the different grades. Risk rates were determined through direct meta-analysis and 
      indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: 12 randomized clinical trials were included 
      with a total of 7155 NSCLC patients. Network meta-analysis generated 15 comparisons. 
      The combination treatment of I+C+D showed a longer progression-free survival and 
      overall survival, while I+C was less toxic, and the toxicity of I+C+D or that of I+C 
      had been significantly decreased, compared to that of monotherapy with either drug. 
      According to the ranking analysis, I+C+D is consistently proved to be the most 
      effective therapeutic strategy, while I+C is linked to the lowest rate of irAEs, 
      with the rate of grade value of ≥3 irAEs. CONCLUSION: The combination treatment of 
      I+C+D is the most effective approach for the first-line treatment of NSCLC patients 
      treated with I+C, I, or C.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, five biologic treatment options are available for use in 
      patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma: three interleukin (IL)-5 antagonists, 
      which either bind to the anti-IL-5 ligand (mepolizumab, reslizumab) or to the IL-5 
      receptor (benralizumab); one anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-IgE) therapy (omalizumab); 
      and one anti-IL-4/IL-13 therapy (dupilumab). To date, no comparative data from 
      head-to-head clinical trials are available for these biologics. OBJECTIVE: An 
      indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of dupilumab versus each of the anti-IL-5 and 
      anti-IgE therapies using the endpoints of annualized severe asthma exacerbation 
      rates and change in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). 
      METHODS: Embase®, MEDLINE®, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      (CENTRAL) were searched for studies published between January 1, 1980 and March 25, 
      2019. Eligible articles included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients 
      aged ≥ 12 years with persistent/uncontrolled asthma using at least medium-to-high 
      dose inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β(2)-agonist with add-on biologic 
      therapy. Bucher ITCs were performed to compare subgroups of dupilumab patients with 
      the anti-IL-5s and anti-IgE trial populations. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs were included 
      in the analyses. The matched dupilumab subgroups were associated with greater 
      reductions in annualized severe exacerbation rates compared with benralizumab, 
      mepolizumab, reslizumab, and omalizumab (54%, 28%, 38%, and 26% greater reduction, 
      respectively). A greater improvement in FEV(1) was also observed for dupilumab at 
      week 12 and/or week 24/52 than for the other biologics (0.06-0.14 L). CONCLUSION: In 
      this ITC, dupilumab was associated with lower severe asthma exacerbation rates and 
      greater improvements in lung function than anti-IL-5s and omalizumab.

TI  - Indirect comparison of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus nivolumab + ipilimumab in 
      first-line metastatic lung cancer.
PG  - 295-307
LID - 10.2217/imt-2021-0273 [doi]
AB  - Aim: This study indirectly compared the effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy 
      versus nivolumab + ipilimumab in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Materials 
      and methods: A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was conducted using pooled 
      individual patient data from KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042 and published aggregate 
      data from CheckMate 227 Part 1A, with platinum doublet chemotherapy as the anchor. 
      Results: After matching, estimated hazard ratios (95% CI) of pembrolizumab 
      monotherapy versus nivolumab + ipilimumab for overall survival and progression-free 
      survival were 1.07 (0.82, 1.39) and 1.16 (0.93, 1.45), respectively. For objective 
      response rate, the estimated risk ratio (95% CI) was 0.93 (0.71, 1.22) and the risk 
      difference (95% CI) was -2.86%(-11.38, 5.67). Conclusion: Matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison results demonstrated comparable effectiveness between pembrolizumab 
      monotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab as first-line therapies for metastatic 
      non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 tumor-proportion score ≥1%.

AB  - Aim: To compare efficacy of apomorphine sublingual film (APL) and levodopa 
      inhalation powder (CVT-301) for 'on-demand' treatment of Parkinson's disease 'OFF' 
      episodes. Patients & methods: Patient-level data from an APL pivotal study were 
      re-weighted to match average baseline characteristics from a CVT-301 study 
      (SPAN-PD). Placebo-adjusted treatments were compared at week 12. Results: 
      Improvements in predose Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores 
      were significantly larger for APL versus CVT-301 at 60 min postdose (least squares 
      mean difference-in-difference: -8.82; p = 0.002); difference at 30 min favored APL 
      but was not statistically significant (-4.46; p = 0.103). Total daily 'OFF' time 
      reductions were significantly larger for APL versus CVT-301 (-1.31 h; p = 0.013). 
      Conclusion: Results suggest APL treatment may lead to improved efficacy versus 
      CVT-301.

TI  - Importance of Time Point-Specific Indirect Treatment Comparisons of Osteoporosis 
      Treatments: A Systematic Literature Review and Network Meta-Analyses.

LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2021.11.015 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The efficacy comparison of osteoporosis treatments can be hindered by the 
      absence of head-to-head trials; instead, network meta-analyses (NMAs) have been used 
      to determine comparative effectiveness. This study was the first to investigate the 
      impact of time point-specific NMAs of osteoporosis treatments on variability in 
      treatments' onset of action caused by their different mechanisms of actions and 
      trial designs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for postmenopausal women with 
      osteoporosis, including romosozumab (ROMO), teriparatide (TPTD), abaloparatide 
      (ABL), alendronate (ALN), risedronate (RIS), ibandronate (IB), zoledronic 
      acid/zoledronate (ZOL), denosumab (DEN), and raloxifene (RLX), on at least 1 
      fracture or bone mineral density (BMD) outcome. Of 100 RCTs identified in 5 
      databases, 27 RCTs were included for NMAs of new vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip 
      fracture outcomes at 12, 24, and 36 months, and 47 RCTs were included for NMAs of 
      BMD outcomes at lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck to compare the relative 
      efficacy of osteoporosis treatments. Quality of included studies was assessed using 
      the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. FINDINGS: For vertebral fractures, TPTD (83.63%), 
      ABL (69.11%), and ROMO/ALN (78.70%) had the highest probability to be the most 
      effective treatment at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. ROMO/ALN had the highest 
      probability (54.4%, 64.69%, and 90.29%, respectively) to be the most effective 
      treatment for nonvertebral fractures at 12, 24, and 36 months. For hip fractures, 
      ROMO/ALN (46.31%), ABL (61.1%), and DEN (55.21%) had the highest probability to be 
      the most effective treatment at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. ROMO had the 
      highest probability (76.06%, 44.19%, and 51.78%, respectively) to be the most 
      effective treatment for BMD outcomes at lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. 
      IMPLICATIONS: The importance of indirectly comparing available osteoporosis 
      treatments using time point-specific NMAs was confirmed because indirect comparison 
      results differed substantially across time points.

TI  - An indirect comparison meta-analysis of noninvasive intravesical instillation and 
      intravesical injection of botulinum toxin-A in bladder disorders.
PG  - 479-491
LID - 10.1007/s11255-022-03107-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) intravesical instillation and BTX-A 
      intravesical injection are both effective treatments or overactive bladder (OAB) and 
      interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), but direct comparative studies 
      of the two treatments are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a pairs-comparison 
      meta-analysis and an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis extracting published 
      data from randomized controlled trials in literature databases from the inception of 
      each database to Aug. 31, 2021, evaluating efficacy and safety of BTX-A intravesical 
      instillation and BTX-A intravesical injection. We also carried out a subgroup 
      analysis. RESULTS: We identified 24 trials in 21 studies were included in our study, 
      of which 18 trials in 17 studies were BTX-A intravesical injections, 6 trials in 4 
      studies were BTX-A intravesical instillation. Compared with the normal saline 
      injection, BTX-A intravesical injections for patients with OAB and IC/ BPS can 
      obviously improve the symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency episode, UI and UUI, 
      but BTX-A significantly increased the rate of urinary retention and urinary tract 
      infection and increased PVR (p < 0.05). Adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis 
      showed that BTX-A intravesical injections was more effective than BTX-A intravesical 
      instillation (p > 0.05). Surprisingly, BTX-A intravesical instillation had fewer 
      side effects than BTX-A intravesical injections (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      BTX-A intravesical injections of OAB and IC/BPS has been significantly superior the 
      BTX-A intravesical instillation, it has major side effects, but this needs to be 
      confirmed by more large-scale, multicenter, direct comparison randomized controlled 
      trials.

TI  - An anchored simulated treatment comparison of uptitration of amlodipine compared 
      with a low-dose combination treatment with amlodipine 5 mg/bisoprolol 5 mg for 
      patients with hypertension suboptimally controlled by amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy.
PG  - 587-593
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2022.2030112 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP) 
      from baseline to following 8 weeks of treatment with a low dose combination of 
      amlodipine 5 mg plus bisoprolol 5 mg versus up titration to the maximum daily dose 
      of amlodipine 10 mg, in hypertensive patients uncontrolled by amlodipine 5 mg. 
      METHODS: Individual patient data (IPD) from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) 
      comparing the combination versus amlodipine 5 mg (EudraCT Number: 2019-000751-13) 
      and aggregated data (AgD) from a published RCT comparing amlodipine 10 mg versus 
      amlodipine 5 mg were utilized in an anchored simulated treatment comparison (STC). 
      The RCT with IPD was used to create models assessing how patients might respond to 
      the combination if they were more comparable to those patients in the RCT with AgD. 
      A population-adjusted indirect comparison of the treatment strategies was then 
      conducted, using amlodipine 5 mg as an anchor. RESULTS: In the efficacy analyses, a 
      total of 261 patients were included in the amlodipine 10 mg arm of the RCT with AgD; 
      and a total of 178 patients in the low-dose combination arm of the RCT with IPD. 
      Respectively, in the Amlodipine 10 mg arm and in the low-dose combination arm, the 
      mean age was 54.3 years-old (Standard deviation [SD] 10.6), and 57.1 years-old 
      (13.7); 8.7% and 18.8% of patients were diabetics; and the mean baseline SBP/DBP was 
      149.3 (12.0)/96.5 (4.7) mmHg, and 148.8 (8.2)/90.2 (7.6) mmHg. The final model for 
      SBP and DBP included the following variables: baseline SBP, baseline DBP, duration 
      of hypertension, age, concomitant diabetes, sex, smoking history (final model for 
      SBP only), and body mass index (final model for DBP only). Mean treatment 
      differences (standard error [SE]) at 8 weeks between the combination and uptitration 
      were -1.6 mmHg (1.9) for SBP; and -3.3 mmHg (1.3) for DBP. CONCLUSION: In this 
      indirect comparison, a more important decrease was observed in DBP with the low-dose 
      combination as compared to the alternative therapeutic approach of up-titration from 
      amlodipine 5 mg to amlodipine 10 mg. No meaningful difference was seen for SBP.

TI  - How does risdiplam compare with other treatments for Types 1-3 spinal muscular 
      atrophy: a systematic literature review and indirect treatment comparison.
PG  - 347-370
LID - 10.2217/cer-2021-0216 [doi]
AB  - Aim: To conduct indirect treatment comparisons between risdiplam and other approved 
      treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Patients & methods: Individual patient 
      data from risdiplam trials were compared with aggregated data from published studies 
      of nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec, accounting for heterogeneity across 
      studies. Results: In Type 1 SMA, studies of risdiplam and nusinersen included 
      similar populations. Indirect comparison results found improved survival and motor 
      function with risdiplam versus nusinersen. Comparison with onasemnogene abeparvovec 
      in Type 1 SMA and with nusinersen in Types 2/3 SMA was challenging due to 
      substantial differences in study populations; no concrete conclusions could be drawn 
      from the indirect comparison analyses. Conclusion: Indirect comparisons support 
      risdiplam as a superior alternative to nusinersen in Type 1 SMA.

      Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma.

AB  - No head-to-head trials have compared the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel versus 
      historical treatments for adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell 
      lymphoma (r/r DLBCL). This study indirectly compared the overall survival (OS) and 
      overall response rate (ORR) associated with tisagenlecleucel, using data from the 
      JULIET study (NCT02445248), versus historical treatments assessed in the CORAL study 
      follow-up population. To assess treatment effects in the treated (full analysis set 
      [FAS]) and enrolled (intent-to-treat [ITT]) study populations, the JULIET FAS vs. 
      the CORAL follow-up FAS and JULIET ITT vs. CORAL follow-up ITT populations were 
      separately compared. Propensity score weighting using standardized mortality ratio 
      weight (SMRW) and fine stratification weight (FSW) was used to compare OS and ORR, 
      adjusting for baseline confounders. The results indicated that tisagenlecleucel was 
      associated with a lower hazard of death among the FAS (adjusted hazard ratio [95% 
      CI], both FSW and SMRW: 0.44 [0.32, 0.59]) and ITT populations (FSW: 0.60 [0.44, 
      0.77], SMRW: 0.57 [0.44, 0.73]; all p<0.001). Median OS was 12.48 months (JULIET) 
      vs. 4.34-4.40 months (CORAL) for the FAS, and 8.25 (JULIET) vs. 4.04-4.86 (CORAL) 
      for the ITT populations. Tisagenlecleucel was associated with a significantly higher 
      ORR compared to historical treatments among the FAS (adjusted response rate 
      difference [95% CI], both FSW and SMRW: 36% [22%, 0.48%]; p<0.001) and among the ITT 
      populations after SMRW adjustment (11% [0%, 22%]; p=0.043). This analysis supports 
      that improved response and OS are achieved in r/r DLBCL patients treated with 
      tisagenlecleucel when compared to those treated with alternative historical 
      treatments.

AB  - In metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the efficacy of immune 
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with chemotherapy has been demonstrated 
      in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Despite this, an indirect comparison is not 
      yet available. Reconstruction of individual patient data from Kaplan-Meier curves 
      allows the indirect comparison of different treatments. We analyzed six overall 
      survival (OS) curves from three RCTs. In patients with ≥1% positivity, atezolizumab 
      was found to determine a significantly better OS than pembrolizumab. As 
      regards pembrolizumab, adopting a threshold of PD-L1 positivity ≥10% (as opposed to 
      ≥1%) improved median survival to a remarkable extent (23.0 vs 15.5 months).

PG  - 421-428
LID - 10.1097/MAO.0000000000003464 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of different treatments for posterior 
      semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (PC-BPPV) by using direct 
      and indirect evidence from existing randomized data. METHODS: Randomized 
      case-control studies that compared the efficacy of various nonsurgical treatments in 
      PC-BPPV patients at 1 week and 1 month of follow-up were comprehensively screened. 
      Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to evaluate direct and indirect 
      treatment comparisons. We further conducted subgroup pairwise meta-analysis to 
      explore the inconsistency between comparisons of the Epley versus a sham maneuver 
      and the Epley versus the Semont maneuver. RESULTS: A total of 41 parallel, 
      randomized controlled studies were included. The Epley with vestibular 
      rehabilitation (EVR), Epley, Semont and Hybrid maneuvers were effective in 
      eliminating nystagmus during a Dix-Hallpike test at 1 week of follow-up (odds ratios 
      [ORs]: 11.41-23.8, 95% credible interval [CrI]: excluding null), among which EVR 
      showed the best efficacy (the surface area under the cumulative ranking curves 
      [SUCRA] = 77.5%). However, at 1 month of follow-up, only the Semont (rank first, 
      SUCRA = 76.1%) and Epley maneuvers (rank second, SUCRA = 65.3%) were effective in 
      eliminating nystagmus during a Dix-Hallpike test. In the pairwise subgroup 
      meta-analysis, for patients younger than 55 years of age, the efficacy of the Epley 
      maneuver was comparable to that of the Semont maneuver [rate ratio (RR): 0.99, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.05]; for patients with a longer duration before 
      treatment, the effect of the Epley maneuver was equivalent to that of a sham 
      maneuver (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.90-1.29). CONCLUSION: Among the 12 types of PC-BPPV 
      treatments, the Epley, Semont, EVR, and Hybrid maneuvers were effective in 
      eliminating nystagmus during a Dix-Hallpike test for PC-BPPV at 1 week of follow-up, 
      whereas only the Epley and Semont maneuvers were effective at 1 month of follow-up. 
      The duration before treatments and the age of patients might contribute to the 
      efficacy of treatments.

TI  - A Cost-effectiveness Analysis Comparing Pembrolizumab-Axitinib, 
      Nivolumab-Ipilimumab, and Sunitinib for Treatment of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.
PG  - 66-73
LID - 10.1097/COC.0000000000000884 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nivolumab-ipilimumab 
      and pembrolizumab-axitinib as first-line treatments for metastatic, clear-cell, 
      renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) based on results from CheckMate 214 and KEYNOTE-426. Our 
      objective was to compare the adjusted, lifetime cost-effectiveness between 
      nivolumab-ipilimumab, pembrolizumab-axitinib, and sunitinib for patients with mRCC. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3-state Markov model was developed comparing 
      nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib to each other and sunitinib, over a 
      20-year lifetime horizon from a US medical center perspective. The clinical outcomes 
      of nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib were compared using 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison. Costs of drug treatment, adverse events, and 
      utilities associated with different health states and adverse events were determined 
      using national sources and published literature. Our outcome was incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using quality-adjusted life years (QALY). One-way 
      and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Nivolumab-ipilimumab 
      was the most cost-effective option in the base case analysis with an ICER of 
      $34,190/QALY compared with sunitinib, while the pembrolizumab-axitinib ICER was 
      dominated by nivolumab-ipilimumab and was not cost-effective (ICER=$12,630,828/QALY) 
      compared with sunitinib. The mean total costs per patient for the 
      nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib arms were $284,683 and $457,769, 
      respectively, compared with sunitinib at $241,656. QALY was longer for 
      nivolumab-ipilimumab (3.23 QALY) than for adjusted pembrolizumab-axitinib (1.99 
      QALY), which was longer than sunitinib's (1.98 QALY). These results were most 
      sensitive to treatment cost in both groups, but plausible changes did not alter the 
      conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: The base case scenario indicated that nivolumab-ipilimumab 
      was the most cost-effective treatment option for mRCC compared with 
      pembrolizumab-axitinib and sunitinib.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated 
      high overall effectiveness for the three US-authorized COVID-19 vaccines against 
      symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Nevertheless, the challenges associated with the use 
      of observational data can undermine the results of the studies. OBJECTIVE: To assess 
      the feasibility of using observational data for vaccine effectiveness studies by 
      examining granular weekly effectiveness. DESIGN SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: In this 
      retrospective cohort study, we used Columbia University Medical Center data linked 
      to State and City Immunization Registries to assess the weekly effectiveness of mRNA 
      COVID-19 vaccines. We conducted manual chart review of cases in week one in both 
      groups along with a set of sensitivity analyses for Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and 
      Janssen vaccines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used propensity score matching with 
      up to 54,987 covariates and fitted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate 
      hazard ratios and constructed Kaplan-Meier plots for two main outcomes (COVID-19 
      infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization). RESULTS: The study included 
      179,666 patients. We observed increasing effectiveness after the first dose of mRNA 
      vaccines with week 6 effectiveness approximating 84% (95% CI 72-91%) for COVID-19 
      infection and 86% (95% CI 69-95) for COVID-19-associated hospitalization. When 
      analyzing unexpectedly high effectiveness in week one, chart review revealed that 
      vaccinated patients are less likely to seek care after vaccination and are more 
      likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 during the encounters for other conditions. 
      Sensitivity analyses showed potential outcome misclassification for COVID-19 
      ICD10-CM diagnosis and the influence of excluding patients with prior COVID-19 
      infection and anchoring in the unexposed group. Overall vaccine effectiveness 
      analysis in fully vaccinated patients matched the results of the randomized trials. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Observational data can be used to ascertain vaccine 
      effectiveness if potential biases are accounted for. The data need to be scrutinized 
      to ensure that compared groups exhibit similar health seeking behavior and are 
      equally likely to be captured in the data. Given the difference in temporal trends 
      of vaccine exposure and baseline characteristics, indirect comparison of vaccines 
      may produce biased results. KEY POINTS: Question: When accounted for all potential 
      biases, what is the weekly effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines?Findings: In this 
      cohort study we replicated the results of randomized clinical trials, discovered 
      plausible increase in effectiveness after week one following the first dose of mRNA 
      COVID-19 vaccines and found differences in temporal trends of vaccine exposure and 
      baseline characteristics in vaccinated groups.Meaning: Observational data can be 
      used to reliably estimate vaccine effectiveness if the biases are accounted for. 
      Vaccines need to be directly compared.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of tisagenlecleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel among adults 
      with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphomas: an indirect treatment comparison.

AB  - This study compared overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), complete 
      response rate (CRR), and overall response rate (ORR) of tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) 
      and lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) in relapsed or refractory large B-cell 
      lymphomas (r/r LBCL). Using matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), individual 
      patient-level data from JULIET (tisa-cel) were weighted to match the patient 
      population in TRANSCEND (liso-cel). The main analysis compared infused JULIET 
      patients (N = 106) with the TRANSCEND efficacy-evaluable set (EES) (N = 256 
      [infused]). After adjustment, OS, PFS, and the CRR were comparable between tisa-cel 
      and liso-cel EES patients. The estimated adjusted 2-year OS, 2-year PFS, ORR, and 
      CRR were 45.6, 38.2, 62.9, and 47.7%, respectively, for tisa-cel vs. 43.8, 42.1, 
      72.7, and 53.1% for liso-cel. A scenario analysis compared JULIET patients to the 
      TRANSCEND primary analysis set (PAS) (N = 133). ORR was significantly higher in the 
      TRANSCEND PAS compared with matched JULIET patients, but no significant differences 
      in CRR were observed.

TI  - Efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Patients with Mismatch Repair-Deficient 
      or Microsatellite Instability-High Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Analysis of Three 
      Phase-II Trials.
PG  - e19893
LID - 10.7759/cureus.19893 [doi]
LID - e19893
AB  - Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) 
      inhibitors are increasingly used in a variety of solid tumors. In patients with DNA 
      mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic 
      colorectal cancer, their efficacy has been demonstrated in recently published 
      phase-II trials. However, an indirect comparison of effectiveness between 
      pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and nivolumab+ipilimumab is not yet available. After a 
      standard literature search, we analyzed four overall survival (OS) curves from three 
      phase-II trials. Individual patient data were reconstructed from each curve using a 
      specific web-based technique (Shiny method). Indirect statistical comparisons were 
      made based on hazard ratio (HR) and restricted mean survival time (RMST). 
      Nivolumab+ipilumumab had a better HR compared with pembrolizumab (0.65, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 1.002, p=0.051); the difference being close to 
      statistical significance. In the analysis based on RMST, the combination of 
      nivolumab+ipilimumab showed a significantly longer OS than pembrolizumab 
      (improvement in RMST, 1.08 mos; 95%CI, 0.11 to 2.06; p=0.029). The other two 
      pairwise differences in RMST (nivolumab vs. pembrolizumab and nivolumab+ ipilimumab 
      vs. nivolumab) had a smaller magnitude (0.25 mos, 95%CI, -0.99 to 1.48, and 0.84 
      mos, 95%CI, -0.40 to 2.07, respectively) and were far from statistical significance. 
      Our results favoring the combination of nivolumab+ipilimumab in metastatic 
      colorectal cancer must be viewed with caution owing to the indirect nature of our 
      statistical comparisons. With this limitation in mind, the magnitude of the 
      incremental benefit for the above combination treatment was estimated to be around 
      one month over a follow-up of 15 months.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of ravulizumab and eculizumab in the treatment of atypical 
      hemolytic uremic syndrome: An indirect comparison using clinical trial data .
LID - 10.5414/CN110516 [doi]
AB  - Ravulizumab and eculizumab are approved terminal complement inhibitor treatments for 
      atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Ravulizumab was engineered from 
      eculizumab to have an increased half-life allowing for reduced dosing frequency 
      (8-weekly vs. 2-weekly). To account for differences in respective clinical trials, a 
      validated balancing technique was used to enable an indirect comparison of 
      ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment efficacy in aHUS. Patient-level data from four 
      eculizumab clinical trials were available for pooling and comparison with data from 
      two ravulizumab trials. In the primary analysis, adult native kidney data were 
      compared. Propensity scores were calculated from baseline characteristics (dialysis 
      status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, platelet count, serum lactate 
      dehydrogenase). Stabilized inverse probability weighting was used to balance groups. 
      Changes in outcomes from baseline to 26 weeks were compared between treatment 
      groups. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of 
      findings. Overall, 85 patients (46 ravulizumab, 39 eculizumab) were included in the 
      primary analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics were well balanced after 
      weighting at baseline. At 26 weeks, clinical outcomes (including renal function, 
      hematological markers, and dialysis prevalence), and fatigue and quality of life 
      measures were improved with eculizumab and ravulizumab treatment. No differences 
      between treatment groups reached statistical significance, although confidence 
      intervals were wide. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis results were consistent with 
      those of the primary analysis. Using appropriate methodology for indirect comparison 
      of studies, no differences in outcomes were seen between ravulizumab and eculizumab, 
      although, owing to small sample sizes, confidence intervals were wide. .

TI  - An indirect treatment comparison of semaglutide 2.0 mg versus dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 
      4.5 mg using multilevel network meta-regression.
LID - dgab905 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgab905 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Currently no head-to-head data are available comparing semaglutide 2.0 mg with 
      dulaglutide 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg. We conducted an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of 
      their effects on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight in patients with type 
      2 diabetes (T2D). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multilevel network meta-regression (MLNMR) 
      was conducted, based on a connected evidence network of published results from the 
      AWARD-11 trial and individual patient data (IPD) from the SUSTAIN FORTE and SUSTAIN 
      7 trials. RESULTS: Semaglutide 2.0 mg significantly reduced HbA1c versus dulaglutide 
      3.0 mg and 4.5 mg, with estimated treatment differences (ETD) of -0.44%-points (95% 
      credible interval [CrI]: -0.68, -0.19) and -0.28%-points (95% CrI: -0.52, -0.03), 
      respectively. Semaglutide 2.0 mg also significantly reduced body weight versus 
      dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg with ETDs of -3.29 kg (95% CrI: -4.62, -1.96) and 
      -2.57 kg (95% CrI: -3.90, -1.24), respectively. Odds of achieving HbA1c <7.0% were 
      significantly greater for semaglutide 2.0 versus dulaglutide 3.0 mg (odds ratio 
      [OR]: 2.23 [95% CrI: 1.15, 3.90]), while this did not reach significance for 
      semaglutide 2.0 mg versus dulaglutide 4.5 mg (OR: 1.58 [95% CrI: 0.82, 2.78]). 
      Sensitivity analyses supported the main analysis findings. CONCLUSIONS: This ITC 
      demonstrated significantly greater reductions from baseline in HbA1c and body weight 
      with semaglutide 2.0 mg vs dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg. The findings of this study 
      provide important comparative effectiveness information until randomised 
      head-to-head studies become available.

TI  - Use of [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic 
      neuroendocrine tumours: Results of a UK cost-effectiveness modelling study.
PG  - 14-23
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcsup.2021.06.003 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE versus relevant 
      comparators for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours located in the 
      gastrointestinal tract (GI-NETs) and the pancreas (P-NETs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      three-state partitioned survival model was developed to perform a cost-utility 
      analysis of [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE versus standard of care (high dose Octreotide 
      LAR), everolimus and sunitinib. Effectiveness data for SoC, everolimus and sunitinib 
      were obtained from published Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Given a lack of 
      head-to-head effectiveness data, matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) were 
      performed to population-adjust [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE survival data based on 
      prognostic factors and derive estimates of relative effectiveness. Health state 
      utilities were estimated from real-world evidence. Drug acquisition costs were taken 
      from nationally published sources (BNF, NICE), and administration costs were based 
      on treatment protocols in [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE studies, combined with nationally 
      published unit costs (PSSRU, DoH reference costs). Incidence of adverse events were 
      estimated using published sources. A discount rate of 3.5% was applied to both 
      utilities and costs, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
      performed. Costs were included from an NHS perspective and presented in 2017/18 GBP 
      (and PPP Euros for base case). RESULTS: In GI-NETs, the incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE compared to SoC and 
      everolimus was £26,528 (€27,672) and £24,145 (€25,186) per QALY, respectively. In 
      P-NETs, the ICER of [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE compared to SoC was £22,146 (€23,101) or 
      £28,038 (€29,251) dependent on matched population, and £21,827 (€22,766) and £15,768 
      (€16,445) compared to everolimus and sunitinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: At a 
      willingness to pay threshold of £30,000, [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE is likely to be a 
      cost-effective treatment option for GI-NET and P-NET patients versus relevant 
      treatment comparators (NHS perspective).

      and sunitinib in advanced, unresectable gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine

AB  - Head-to-head comparisons of the efficacy of treatments for gastroenteropancreatic 
      neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs) have not yet been reported. This study used a 
      series of matching-adjusted indirect comparisons to indirectly compare the 
      effectiveness of [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE to everolimus, sunitinib and best supportive 
      care (BSC) for extending progression-free survival and overall survival in patients 
      with advanced, unresectable gastrointestinal (GI)-NETs and P-NETs. The results of 
      the main analysis suggest that after accounting for differences in key prognostic 
      variables, the hazard of progression was 62% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; confidence 
      interval [CI](95) 0.25-0.58) and 65% (HR 0.35 CI(95) 0.21-0.59) lower in patients 
      with GI-NETs treated with [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE than in those treated with 
      everolimus and BSC, respectively. Similarly, the hazard of progression was 64% (HR 
      0.36 CI(95) 0.18-0.70), 54% (HR 0.46 CI(95) 0.30-0.71) and 79-87% (HR 0.21 CI(95) 
      0.13-0.32; HR 0.13 CI(95) 0.08-0.22) lower in patients with P-NET treated with 
      [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE than in those treated with sunitinib, everolimus and BSC, 
      respectively. The hazard of death was 58% (HR 0.42 CI(95) 0.25-0.72), 47% (HR 0.53 
      CI(95) 0.33-0.87) and 44-64% (HR 0.56 CI(95) 0.36-0.90; HR 0.34 CI(95) 0.20-0.57) 
      lower in P-patients with NET treated with [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE than in those 
      treated with sunitinib, everolimus and BSC, respectively. While our results must be 
      interpreted with caution given the non-randomised nature of the comparisons and the 
      potential for residual confounding, the magnitude of the effect sizes we observe and 
      their consistency across comparators suggest that [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE may be a 
      more effective treatment option than everolimus, sunitinib and BSC in advanced, 
      unresectable GEP-NETs.

AB  - Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) is a Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy 
      with the potential for long-term disease control in heavily pre-treated patients 
      with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). As cilta-cel was assessed in the 
      single-arm CARTITUDE-1 clinical trial, we used an external cohort of patients from 
      the Therapie Monitor registry fulfilling the CARTITUDE-1 inclusion criteria to 
      evaluate the effectiveness of cilta-cel for overall survival (OS) and time to next 
      treatment (TTNT) vs. real-world clinical practice. Individual patient data allowed 
      us to adjust the comparisons between both cohorts, using the inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting (IPW; average treatment effect in the treated population (ATT) 
      and overlap population (ATO) weights) and multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
      regression. Outcomes were compared in intention-to-treat (HR, IPW-ATT: TTNT: 0.13 
      (95% CI: 0.07, 0.24); OS: 0.14 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.25); IPW-ATO: TTNT: 0.24 (95% CI: 
      0.12, 0.49); OS: 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.54)) and modified intention-to-treat (HR, 
      IPW-ATT: TTNT: 0.24 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.67); OS: 0.26 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.84); IPW-ATO: 
      TTNT: 0.26 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.59); OS: 0.31 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.79)) populations. All the 
      comparisons were statistically significant in favor of cilta-cel. These results 
      highlight cilta-cel's potential as a novel, effective treatment to address unmet 
      needs in patients with RRMM.

TI  - Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Crisaborole Ointment 2% vs. Topical 
      Calcineurin Inhibitors in the Treatment of Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Atopic 
      Dermatitis.
PG  - 185-194
LID - 10.1007/s13555-021-00646-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crisaborole topical ointment, 2%, is a nonsteroidal, topical 
      anti-inflammatory phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor that is approved for the 
      treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). The objective of the current 
      analysis was to compare the efficacy of crisaborole 2% relative to pimecrolimus 1%, 
      tacrolimus 0.03% and tacrolimus 0.1% in patients aged ≥ 2 years with 
      mild-to-moderate AD by comparing improvement in Investigator's Static Global 
      Assessment scores ( (ISGA scores of 0/1 indicating "clear or almost clear"). ISGA 
      was selected as the primary efficacy outcome given the US Food and Drug 
      Administration's recommendations on the use of ISGA for assessment of global 
      severity in AD and to align with efficacy measurements in the crisaborole 
      registration trials. Safety endpoints could not be analyzed due to differences in 
      outcome definitions across studies. METHODS: Efficacy of crisaborole was evaluated 
      using individual patient data (IPD) from two pivotal phase III randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs), and efficacy of comparators was evaluated using published RCTs 
      included in a previous network meta-analysis. Vehicle controls were not comparable 
      due to differences in ingredients and population imbalance and, therefore, an 
      unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was used, which reweighted 
      IPD for crisaborole to estimate absolute response in comparator populations. 
      RESULTS: The odds of achieving an improvement in ISGA score was higher with 
      crisaborole 2% versus pimecrolimus 1% (odds ratio [OR] 2.03; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 1.45-2.85; effective sample size =  627, reduced from 1021; p value < 0.001) 
      and for crisaborole 2% versus tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.09-2.05; effective 
      sample size = 311, reduced from 1021; p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: The unanchored MAIC 
      suggests that the odds of achieving an improvement in ISGA score is greater with 
      crisaborole 2% than with pimecrolimus 1% or tacrolimus 0.03% in patients 
      aged ≥ 2 years with mild-to-moderate AD. These results are consistent with findings 
      from the previously published network meta-analysis, which used a different 
      methodology for performing indirect treatment comparisons.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of cenobamate relative to other antiseizure 
      medications (ASMs) has not been evaluated. An indirect treatment comparison (network 
      meta-analysis) was performed to determine if adjunctive cenobamate increases the 
      odds ratio (OR) for ≥50% responder rate or for withdrawals due to treatment-emergent 
      adverse events (TEAEs) leading to ASM discontinuation versus adjunctive therapy with 
      other ASMs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (maintenance phase ≥ 12 weeks) 
      assessing adjunctive ASMs in adults with uncontrolled focal seizures. Cenobamate was 
      compared to a group of seven other ASMs, and to subgroups of branded (brivaracetam, 
      eslicarbazepine acetate, lacosamide, and perampanel) and older (lamotrigine, 
      levetiracetam, and topiramate) ASMs at FDA-recommended daily maintenance doses 
      (FDA-RDMD), at all doses, and at maximum and minimum daily doses. Statistical 
      significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were eligible for 
      analysis. The placebo-adjusted ≥ 50% responder rate for FDA-RDMD of cenobamate was 
      superior (OR 4.200; 95% CI 2.279, 7.742) to FDA-RDMD of all seven assessed (OR 2.202 
      95% CI 1.915, 2.532; p = 0.044) and branded ASMs (OR 2.148; 95% CI 1.849, 2.494; 
      p = 0.037). There was no significant difference for ≥50% responder rate between 
      FDA-RDMD of cenobamate and FDA-RDMD of older ASMs (OR 2.617; 95% CI 1.767, 3.878; 
      p = 0.202). No significant differences were identified for ≥50% responder rate when 
      comparing all doses and maximum/minimum doses of cenobamate to all seven, branded, 
      and older ASMs. Cenobamate demonstrated comparable TEAE withdrawal rates to all 
      seven ASMs, branded ASMs, and older ASMs across each of the four dose ranges (all 
      p > 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Patients receiving FDA-RDMD of cenobamate were more likely 
      to have ≥50% seizure reduction compared with FDA-RDMD of the seven assessed ASMs and 
      branded ASMs, without an increase in treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs.

TI  - Conceptual Framework and Methodological Challenges for Modeling Effectiveness in 
      Oncology Treatment Sequence Models.
PG  - 257-268
LID - 10.1007/s40273-021-01113-7 [doi]
AB  - In this review, we summarize the challenges faced by existing oncology treatment 
      sequence decision models and introduce a general framework to conceptualize such 
      models. In the proposed framework, patients with cancer receive at least two lines 
      of therapy (LOTs) followed by palliative care throughout their lifetime. Patients 
      cycle through progression-free and progressive disease health states in each LOT 
      before death. Under this framework, four broad aspects of modeling effectiveness of 
      treatment sequences need exploration. First, disease progression, treatment 
      discontinuation, and the relationship between the two events should be considered. 
      Second, the effectiveness of each LOT depends on its placement in a treatment 
      sequence as the effectiveness of later LOTs may be influenced by the earlier LOTs. 
      Third, the treatment-free interval (TFI; time between discontinuation of earlier LOT 
      and initiation of later LOT) may impact a therapy's effectiveness. Fourth, in the 
      absence of head-to-head trials directly comparing LOTs, indirect treatment 
      comparison (ITC) of outcomes for a specific LOT or even for the entire treatment 
      sequence is important to consider. A search of decision models that estimated 
      effectiveness of at least two lines of oncology therapy was conducted in PubMed 
      (N = 20) and technology appraisals by the National Institute for Health and Care 
      Excellence (N = 26) to assess four methodological aspects related to the model 
      framework: (1) selection of outcomes for effectiveness in a treatment sequence, (2) 
      approaches to adjust the efficacy of a treatment in consideration of its place in 
      the sequence, (3) approaches to address TFIs between LOTs, and (4) incorporation of 
      ITCs to estimate comparators' effectiveness in the absence of direct head-to-head 
      evidence. Most models defined health states based on disease progression on 
      different LOTs while estimating treatment duration outside of the main model 
      framework (30/46) and used data from multiple data sources in different LOTs to 
      model efficacy of a treatment sequence (41/46). No models adjusted efficacy for the 
      characteristics of patients who switched from an earlier LOT to a later LOT or 
      adjusted for the impact of prior therapies, and just six models considered TFIs. 
      While 11 models applied ITC results to estimate efficacy in comparator treatment 
      sequences, the majority limited the ITC to one LOT in the sequence. Thus, there is 
      substantial room to improve the estimation of effectiveness for treatment sequences 
      using existing data when comparing effectiveness of alternative treatment sequences.

TI  - Comparative Efficacy of Ciltacabtagene Autoleucel in CARTITUDE-1 vs Physician's 
      Choice of Therapy in the Long-Term Follow-Up of POLLUX, CASTOR, and EQUULEUS 
      Clinical Trials for the Treatment of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple 
      Myeloma.
PG  - 29-41
LID - 10.1007/s40261-021-01100-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) is a novel agent 
      being investigated in the single-arm CARTITUDE-1 trial (NCT03548207) for patients 
      with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who are triple-class exposed to an 
      immunomodulatory drug, proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. 
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative efficacy of cilta-cel vs 
      physician's choice of treatment, as no head-to-head trials have been conducted. 
      METHODS: An external control arm for CARTITUDE-1 was created from patients in the 
      long-term follow-up for three clinical trials of daratumumab (POLLUX, CASTOR, and 
      EQUULEUS) who satisfied the eligibility criteria of CARTITUDE-1. These patients 
      received physician's choice of treatment following the discontinuation of study 
      drugs. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to align the external 
      control and CARTITUDE-1 populations on important baseline characteristics. Overall 
      response rate, complete response or better rate, progression-free survival, time to 
      next treatment, and overall survival were assessed. Several sensitivity analyses 
      were conducted. RESULTS: After propensity score weighting, baseline characteristics 
      were comparable between cohorts. Patients showed improved results with cilta-cel vs 
      physician's choice of treatment: overall response rate (relative risk: 2.95 [95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 2.27, 3.84; p < 0.0001]), complete response or better 
      (relative risk: 111.70 [95% CI 29.08, 429.06; p < 0.0001]), progression-free 
      survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.24 [95% CI 0.15, 0.37; p < 0.0001]), time to next 
      treatment (HR: 0.14 [95% CI 0.09, 0.22; p < 0.0001]), and overall survival (HR: 0.21 
      [95% CI 0.13, 0.35; p < 0.0001]). Results were consistent across all sensitivity 
      analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Cilta-cel showed superior efficacy compared with physician's 
      choice of treatment, making it a promising new treatment option for patients with 
      triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

TI  - Apalutamide Compared with Darolutamide for the Treatment of Non-metastatic 
      Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Efficacy and Tolerability in a 
      Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison.
PG  - 518-531
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01885-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Apalutamide and darolutamide are next-generation androgen receptor 
      inhibitors that have demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo in men with 
      non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) receiving androgen 
      deprivation therapy (ADT). In the absence of head-to-head studies, the present study 
      sought to indirectly compare the efficacy and tolerability between these two 
      treatments. METHODS: This anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) used 
      patient-level data from the phase 3, randomized, controlled SPARTAN study 
      (apalutamide + ADT), weighted to match aggregate published data from the ARAMIS 
      study (darolutamide + ADT) for clinically relevant baseline measures. Hazard ratios 
      (HR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI) were estimated for efficacy endpoints: 
      metastasis-free survival (MFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, 
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Odds ratios were 
      estimated for tolerability outcomes: adverse events and serious adverse events. 
      RESULTS: Before weighting, baseline characteristics from SPARTAN versus ARAMIS were 
      different for median PSA (7.8 vs. 9.2 ng/mL), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
      performance status of 1 (23% vs. 31%), use of bone-targeted agents (10% vs. 4%), 
      median time from initial diagnosis (94.9 vs. 85.4 months), and proportion of 
      patients from North America (35% vs. 12%) and Europe (50% vs. 64%). After matching 
      (n = 455), our analysis demonstrated that apalutamide + ADT had a Bayesian 
      probability of being more effective than darolutamide + ADT for MFS [98.3%; HR 0.70 
      (95% CrI 0.51, 0.98)], PSA progression [~ 100%; HR 0.46 (95% CrI 0.33, 0.64)], and 
      PFS [93.2%; HR 0.79 (95% CrI 0.59, 1.08)]. Results for OS and tolerability were 
      similar between apalutamide + ADT and darolutamide + ADT. CONCLUSION: This anchored 
      MAIC analysis of pivotal phase 3 studies in patients with nmCRPC suggests that 
      apalutamide + ADT is more effective than darolutamide + ADT for MFS, 
      progression-free survival (PFS), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, 
      with a similar OS benefit and tolerability profile. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ARAMIS

TI  - Efficacy of Brodalumab and Guselkumab in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Plaque 
      Psoriasis Who are Inadequate Responders to Ustekinumab: A Matching Adjusted Indirect 
      Comparison.
PG  - 123-131
LID - 10.2147/PTT.S326121 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Both brodalumab and guselkumab improve skin clearance in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis after inadequate response to ustekinumab. In the 
      absence of a direct head-to-head comparison, the relative efficacy of brodalumab and 
      guselkumab in non-responders to ustekinumab were compared using a matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison (MAIC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient data for 
      brodalumab (n = 121) were pooled from the AMAGINE-2 and -3 trials and adjusted using 
      a propensity score reweighting method, so that baseline and week 16 characteristics 
      matched the aggregate published data of patients with an inadequate response to 
      ustekinumab who switched to guselkumab (n = 135) in the NAVIGATE trial. RESULTS: 
      After inadequate response to ustekinumab, brodalumab resulted in significantly 
      higher psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 90 rates versus guselkumab at 
      post-treatment switch week 12 (62.7% vs 48.1%, relative difference 14.6% [95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 5.3-23.9], p = 0.002 [number needed to treat [NNT] = 6.8]) 
      and week 36 (63.7% vs 51.1%; relative difference 12.6% [95% CI 4.1-21.0]; p = 0.004 
      [NNT = 7.9]) and PASI 100 rate at week 36 (40.3% vs 20.0%; relative difference 20.3% 
      [95% CI 11.8-28.7]; p < 0.001 [NNT = 4.9]). CONCLUSION: In this MAIC, brodalumab was 
      associated with greater improvements than guselkumab in inadequate responders to 
      ustekinumab. Switching to brodalumab in such patients may be a more effective 
      strategy than switching to guselkumab.

TI  - A cost-consequence analysis of the preferential use of secukinumab versus adalimumab 
      for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficiency of secukinumab compared to adalimumab as first 
      biologic treatment for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) from the Spanish National Health 
      System (SNHS) perspective. METHODS: A cost-consequence analysis of the cost and 
      clinical response of two treatment strategies was conducted over a 2-year time 
      horizon. A hypothetical cohort of 10 patients with PsA initiated treatment with 
      secukinumab 150mg (cohort A) or adalimumab 40mg (cohort B), respectively. Patients 
      achieving clinical response (ACR20/50/70) at week 24 continued the initial 
      treatment, while patients with inadequate response switched to secukinumab 300mg. 
      Pharmacological costs were calculated based on SmPC (notified ex-factory price). The 
      lowest cost of adalimumab biosimilar was considered. Data on clinical response were 
      extracted from the two matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) published 
      comparing secukinumab vs adalimumab. Results were expressed as the cost difference 
      between the two cohorts (€, 2019) and were calculated for each clinical response 
      criteria (ACR20/50/70) and for each MAIC. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact 
      of potential discounts on the cost of adalimumab while maintaining the cost of 
      secukinumab unchanged. RESULTS: Depending on the MAIC used, the cost of initiating 
      biologic treatment for PsA with secukinumab 150mg was 18-33% lower than the one 
      estimated for adalimumab 40mg, for ACR20, 18-28% for ACR50, and 16-23% for ACR70 
      response rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that it would be necessary a discount of 
      40-60%, 40-65% and 50-75% over the adalimumab cost to compensate for the differences 
      in efficacy observed for ACR20/50/70, respectively, depending on the MAIC used. 
      CONCLUSION: In patients with PsA, secukinumab could be considered a more efficient 
      first-line biologic treatment compared to adalimumab, from the SNHS perspective.

TI  - Indirect Treatment Comparison of Damoctocog Alfa Pegol versus Turoctocog Alfa Pegol 
      as Prophylactic Treatment in Patients with Hemophilia A.
PG  - 935-943
LID - 10.2147/JBM.S321288 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and FVIII consumption of BAY 94-9027 versus N8-GP in 
      prophylaxis in adolescent and adult patients with severe hemophilia A (HA). PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies on the 
      efficacy of BAY-94-9027 and N8-GP for prophylaxis in patients with HA aged ≥12 years 
      without a history of inhibitors. Eight studies met systematic literature review 
      inclusion criteria, but only data from PROTECT VIII on BAY 94-9027 and PATHFINDER 2 
      on N8-GP could be used for an indirect comparison. Matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison (MAIC) and simulated treatment comparison were performed. RESULTS: No 
      significant differences (unadjusted and adjusted) were observed in the mean 
      annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for any bleed and proportion of patients with zero 
      bleeds when comparing BAY 94-9027 to N8-GP. The adjusted treatment difference 
      [incidence rate ratio (IRR)] in terms of ABR was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.85-1.44). The odds 
      ratio (OR) of any bleed, measuring the relative effect of BAY 94-9027 versus N8-GP 
      on the proportion of patients with zero bleeds, was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.60-1.77). FVIII 
      consumption was significantly lower in BAY 94-9027 [mean adjusted 
      difference=-1292.57 IU/kg/year (95% CI, ‒2152.44 to ‒432.70)]; a 26.7% reduction in 
      consumption of BAY-94-9027. The results of the sensitivity analyses were similar to 
      the main analysis for mean ABRs, percentages of patients with zero bleeds, and 
      significant reduction in rFVIII consumption. For patients on BAY 94-9027 
      every-5-days and every-7-days, no differences versus every-4-days N8-GP were 
      observed for the mean ABR for any bleed [IRR=0.90 (95% CI, 0.68‒1.20)] and 
      proportion of patients with zero bleeds [OR=1.06 (95% CI, 0.56‒2.02)]. CONCLUSION: 
      BAY 94-9027 prophylaxis demonstrated 26.7% lower annual consumption when compared to 
      N8-GP with similar efficacy in terms of ABR and percentage of patients with zero 
      bleeds.

TI  - Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Ribociclib Plus Fulvestrant versus 
      Palbociclib Plus Letrozole as First-Line Treatment of HR+/HER2- Advanced Breast 
      Cancer.
PG  - 8179-8189
LID - 10.2147/CMAR.S325043 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) plus endocrine therapy are 
      recommended for first-line treatment of hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal 
      growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC). However, 
      not all CDK4/6i trials have reported significant overall survival (OS) benefit, and 
      there have been no head-to-head trials. Two trials have reported OS outcomes in 
      first-line patients: MONALEESA-3 reported significant OS benefit with first- or 
      second-line ribociclib plus fulvestrant (RIB+FUL) versus placebo plus fulvestrant 
      (PBO+FUL), while PALOMA-1 reported no significant OS benefit for palbociclib plus 
      letrozole (PAL+LET) versus LET in first-line postmenopausal patients. 
      Matched-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) are an established method for 
      comparing efficacy of treatments from different trials. We used an MAIC to compare 
      first-line patients from MONALEESA-3 and PALOMA-1. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An 
      unanchored MAIC of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in first-line patients 
      with HR+/HER2- ABC treated with RIB+FUL versus PAL+LET was conducted using 
      individual patient data from MONALEESA-3 and aggregated data from PALOMA-1. To match 
      patients in PALOMA-1, patients in MONALEESA-3 were limited to those with no prior 
      endocrine therapy for ABC and no (neo) adjuvant LET ≤12 months before enrollment. 
      PFS and OS were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox regression. RESULTS: 
      A total of 329 and 178 patients from RIB+FUL and PBO+FUL arms, respectively, of 
      MONALEESA-3 were matched to 84 and 81 patients from PAL+LET and LET arms of 
      PALOMA-1. After weighting, OS was significantly longer for RIB+FUL versus PAL+LET 
      (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32-0.77; p = 0.0020). PFS favored RIB+FUL versus 
      PAL+LET, although the difference was not statistically significant (HR, 0.77; 95% 
      CI, 0.54-1.10; p = 0.1553). CONCLUSION: Using MAIC to adjust for trial differences, 
      OS comparisons favored RIB+FUL over PAL+LET as first-line treatment in 
      postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2- ABC. These exploratory results suggest a 
      significant increase in OS benefit with RIB treatment compared with PAL.

TI  - Palbociclib versus abemaciclib in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer: an indirect 
      comparison of patient-reported end points.
PG  - 109-120
LID - 10.2217/cer-2021-0221 [doi]
AB  - Aim: To assess the relative impact of palbociclib plus fulvestrant (PAL + FUL) and 
      abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (ABEM + FUL) on patient-reported outcomes in patients 
      with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer. 
      Patients & methods: Anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were conducted 
      using individual patient data from PALOMA-3 (PAL + FUL) and summary-level data from 
      MONARCH-2 (ABEM + FUL). Outcomes included the European Organisation for Research and 
      Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30) and 
      its breast cancer-specific module (QLQ-BR23). Results: Significantly different 
      changes from baseline favoring PAL + FUL compared with ABEM + FUL were observed in 
      global quality of life (6.95 [95% CI: 2.19-11.71]; p = 0.004) and several 
      functional/symptom scales, including emotional functioning, nausea/vomiting, 
      appetite loss, diarrhea and systemic therapy side effects. Conclusion: PAL + FUL was 
      associated with more favorable patient-reported outcomes than ABEM + FUL in patients 
      with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The general objective of the study was to reflect on the key factors to 
      advance in optimal models of care for Heart Failure (HF) and specifically, on the 
      macromanagement elements most necessary for the development of comprehensive HF 
      management models. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An Advisory Committee, composed of 15 
      experts and a multidisciplinary group of 31 additional experts, was appointed, 
      together forming a Delphi panel of 46 experts. Based on a systematic bibliographic 
      review and the analysis of the care course of the patient with HF, an initial 
      battery of key factors for the development of HF care models was identified by the 
      Advisory Committee. This proposal was adjusted and prioritized by the Delphi panel 
      applying Delphi Rand/UCLA methodology. RESULTS: After two Delphi rounds, 75 key 
      factors grouped into 7 challenges were defined. In the first of the challenges, 
      related to the development of HF management models, 16 key factors were identified, 
      7 of which were valued as high priority and related to the establishment of common 
      objectives, resources for the continuity of care and improving the measurement of 
      health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The definition of management elements at the macro 
      level was considered a priority to advance in the development of optimal models of 
      assistance to HF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, new therapeutic combinations based on immunotherapy 
      provided significant benefits as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced 
      renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). OBJECTIVE: This work aims to address the lack of 
      head-to-head comparisons and the uncertainty of the benefit from immunotherapy-based 
      combinations in all the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) 
      subgroups. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A systematic review and a network 
      meta-analysis were performed. Overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
      population was the primary endpoint. OS according to IMDC subgroups (favorable, 
      intermediate, poor), PD-L1 expression, and grade ⩾3 adverse events (AEs) were 
      secondary endpoints. A SUCRA analysis was performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Six 
      randomized phase III trials with 5121 patients were included. There was a high 
      likelihood (82%) that nivolumab-cabozantinib was the preferred treatment in OS. The 
      benefit of ICI-based combinations over sunitinib was unclear in the favorable-risk 
      subgroup. Nivolumab-ipilimumab had the best risk/benefit ratio among all the 
      ICI-based combinations. The limitations were the lack of individual patient data; 
      the heterogeneity of patients' characteristics, trial designs, and follow-up times; 
      and a limited number of studies for indirect comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: A customized 
      approach for the first-line treatment of patients with mRCC should consider the 
      risk/benefit profile of each treatment option, especially considering the likeliness 
      of long-term survival finally reached in this setting.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of iGlarLixi Versus iDegLira in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
      Inadequately Controlled by GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and Oral Antihyperglycemic 
      Therapy.
PG  - 3231-3241
LID - 10.1007/s13300-021-01156-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The fixed-ratio combinations (FRCs) of glucagon-like peptide 1 
      receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and basal insulin, insulin glargine 100 U/mL plus 
      lixisenatide (iGlarLixi), and insulin degludec plus liraglutide (iDegLira), have 
      demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      inadequately controlled on GLP-1 RAs. However, a comparative cost-effectiveness 
      analysis between these FRCs from a UK Health Service perspective has not been 
      conducted. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes Model was used to estimate lifetime 
      costs and outcomes in patients with T2DM receiving iGlarLixi (based on the LixiLan-G 
      trial) versus iDegLira (based on relative treatment effects from an indirect 
      treatment comparison using data from DUAL III). Utilities, medical costs, and costs 
      of diabetes-related complications were derived from literature. Model outputs 
      included costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated with a local willingness-to-pay threshold 
      of £20,000 per QALY. Extensive scenario, one-way sensitivity, and probabilistic 
      sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model. 
      RESULTS: iGlarLixi was less costly (iGlarLixi, £30,011; iDegLira, £40,742), owing to 
      lower acquisition costs, and similar in terms of QALYs gained (iGlarLixi, 8.437; 
      iDegLira, 8.422). Extensive scenario and sensitivity analyses supported the base 
      case findings. CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control 
      despite GLP-1 RAs, use of iGlarLixi was associated with substantial cost savings and 
      comparable utility outcomes. iGlarLixi can be considered as cost-effective versus 
      iDegLira from the UK Health Service perspective.

      Controlled on Basal Insulin Plus Metformin in the UK.
PG  - 3217-3230
LID - 10.1007/s13300-021-01159-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted comparing a fixed-ratio 
      combination (FRC) of insulin glargine 100 units/mL plus lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) 
      versus the FRC of insulin degludec plus liraglutide (iDegLira) and the 
      free-combination comparators insulin glargine plus dulaglutide (iGlar plus Dula) and 
      basal insulin plus liraglutide (BI plus Lira). METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes 
      Model was used to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes for a cohort of patients with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from the UK healthcare perspective. Initial clinical 
      data for iGlarLixi were based on the randomized, controlled LixiLan-L trial and the 
      relative treatment effects for comparators were based on an indirect treatment 
      comparison using data from the AWARD-9 (iGlar plus Dula), LIRA ADD2 BASAL (BI plus 
      Lira), and DUAL V (iDegLira) trials. Costs were derived from publicly available 
      sources. Lifetime costs (in British Pound Sterling [£]) and quality-adjusted 
      life-years (QALYs) were predicted; net monetary benefit (NMB) for iGlarLixi versus 
      comparators was derived using a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000. Extensive 
      scenario and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Estimated costs were 
      lowest with iGlarLixi (£31,295) compared with iGlar plus Dula (£38,790), iDegLira 
      (£40,179), and BI plus Lira (£42,467). Total QALYs gained were identical with 
      iGlarLixi and iDegLira (8.438), and comparable with iGlar plus Dula (8.439) and BI 
      plus Lira (8.466). NMB for iGlarLixi was positive versus all comparators (£10,603.86 
      vs. BI plus Lira; £7,466.24 vs. iGlar plus Dula; £8.874.11 vs. iDegLira). 
      CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM with suboptimal glycemic control on basal insulin, 
      iGlarLixi provides very similar outcomes and substantial cost savings, compared with 
      other fixed and free combinations of insulins plus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
      agonists.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparison of pneumococcal vaccines V114 and PCV20.
PG  - 115-123
LID - 10.1080/14760584.2021.1994858 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: V114 (15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV15]) and a 20-valent 
      PCV (PCV20) are approved for adults (≥18 years) in the United States. We present 
      methodologies to indirectly compare immune responses to V114 versus PCV20. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Indirect treatment comparison and matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison (MAIC) were performed to estimate opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) 
      geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios of V114/PCV20 at 30 days post-vaccination with 
      PCV13 as common comparator for 13 serotypes (STs) shared with a 13-valent PCV 
      (PCV13) among pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults aged ≥60 years. Data from three V114 
      studies were pooled (V114, N = 2,196; PCV13, N = 843). In the MAIC analysis, data 
      were reweighted, matching participant age and sex in NCT03760146 (PCV20, N = 1,507; 
      PCV13, N = 1,490). RESULTS: The lower bound of V114/PCV20 OPA GMT ratio for all 
      PCV13 STs is greater than the prespecified  0.5 non-inferiority margin and those for 
      five PCV13 STs (3, 6A, 6B, 18C, and 23F) are greater than the prespecified 1.2 
      superiority margin. V114 was associated with 77% greater OPA GMT for ST3 versus 
      PCV20. CONCLUSION: V114 was non-inferior to PCV20 for all PCV13 STs and 
      statistically superior for five PCV13 STs.

TI  - Mogamulizumab for Previously Treated Mycosis Fungoides and Sézary Syndrome: An 
      Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.
LID - 10.1007/s40273-021-01098-3 [doi]
AB  - The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
      manufacturer (Kyowa Kirin) of mogamulizumab (Poteligeo(®)), as part of the single 
      technology appraisal process, to submit evidence for its clinical and 
      cost-effectiveness for previously treated mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome 
      (SS). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University 
      Medical Centre, was commissioned to act as the independent evidence review group 
      (ERG). This paper summarises the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's 
      critical review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, 
      highlights the key methodological considerations and describes the development of 
      the NICE guidance by the Appraisal Committee. Based on a systematic literature 
      review, one randomised controlled trial, MAVORIC, was identified showing favourable 
      results in patients with MF and SS. However, MAVORIC compared mogamulizumab to 
      vorinostat, which is not standard care in the NHS, and there is uncertainty due to 
      the study design, specifically crossover of patients. Based on a "naïve comparison 
      of results from the vorinostat arm of the MAVORIC study and the physician's choice 
      arm (methotrexate or bexarotene i.e. United Kingdom [UK] standard treatments) of the 
      ALCANZA study as well as comparison to Phase II bexarotene data", the company 
      considered vorinostat to be "a reasonable proxy for current standard of care in the 
      NHS". The ERG considered, based on the limited data available, that the 
      comparability of vorinostat (MAVORIC) and physician's choice (ALCANZA) could not be 
      established. In response to the Appraisal Consultation Document, the company 
      provided an unanchored matched adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of mogamulizumab 
      with UK standard care by analysing Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. However, 
      given the high risk of bias of an unanchored MAIC, these results needed to be 
      regarded with a considerable degree of caution. The economic analysis suffered from 
      uncertainty because there was no trial evidence on the comparator in the England and 
      Wales National Health Service (NHS), and it was unclear to what extent the trial 
      (MAVORIC) comparator (vorinostat) was comparable to standard care, referred to as 
      established clinical management (ECM) in the NHS. The evidence for overall survival 
      had not reached maturity and was confounded by treatment switching, for which 
      different crossover adjustment methods produced large variations in life years. 
      Caregiver utilities were applied in the analysis, but there was a lack of guidance 
      on their application and whether these were indicated in this appraisal. After 
      consultation, the company updated the economic analysis with the MAIC. Incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios comparing mogamulizumab against ECM were (depending on 
      whether the HES or MAVORIC comparison were used) £31,030 or £32,634 per 
      quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained according to the company's base case and 
      £38,274 or £80,555 per QALY gained according to the ERG's base case. NICE did not 
      recommend mogamulizumab for treating MF or SS in adults who have had at least one 
      previous systemic treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nivolumab (an anti-programmed death-1 antibody) is an adjuvant standard 
      of care for patients with high-risk resected melanoma, although a watch-and-wait 
      strategy remains an option. In the absence of head-to-head evidence, an indirect 
      treatment comparison (ITC) of adjuvant nivolumab versus placebo, the proxy for a 
      watch-and-wait strategy, was conducted in patients with high-risk resected melanoma. 
      METHODS: An ITC using the Bucher method compared nivolumab with placebo using 
      intention-to-treat population data from the phase III CheckMate 238 (nivolumab vs 
      ipilimumab; minimum follow-up, 4 years; NCT02388906) and European Organisation for 
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18071 (ipilimumab vs placebo; minimum 
      follow-up, ≈4.5 years; NCT00636168) trials. The end-points were recurrence-free 
      survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS). 
      To account for cross-trial differences in staging and subsequent therapy, additional 
      analyses examined patients with stage IIIB/IIIC disease and adjusted post-recurrence 
      survival in EORTC 18071, respectively. RESULTS: Nivolumab versus placebo was 
      associated with clinically meaningful improvements in RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 
      95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.68) and OS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.89). 
      Nivolumab versus placebo was also associated with clinically meaningful improvements 
      in RFS (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40-0.69), DMFS (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46-0.83) and OS (HR, 
      0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.97) in patients with stage IIIB/IIIC disease and in OS (HR, 
      0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.92) in the overall population after adjusting post-recurrence 
      survival in EORTC 18071. CONCLUSION: This ITC shows that adjuvant nivolumab provides 
      clinically meaningful improvements in RFS, DMFS and OS versus a watch-and-wait 
      strategy in high-risk resected melanoma.

TI  - Oral Anticoagulation Timing in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke and Atrial 
      Fibrillation.
LID - 10.1055/a-1669-4987 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:  Oral anticoagulants (OACs) prevent stroke recurrence and 
      vascular embolism in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). Based on empirical consensus, current guidance recommends a 
      "1-3-6-12 days" rule to resume OACs after AIS. This study investigated the 
      suitability of guideline-recommended timing for OAC initiation. METHODS:  Using data 
      of 12,307 AF patients hospitalized for AIS, for the period 2012 to 2016, in Taiwan's 
      National Health Insurance Research Database, we constructed a sequence of cohorts of 
      OAC users and propensity score-matched nonusers, creating one cohort on each day of 
      OAC initiation for 30 days since admission. Composite outcome included effectiveness 
      (cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic 
      attack, systemic embolism, and venous thromboembolism) and safety (intracranial 
      hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematuria) outcomes. Comparing with 
      nonusers, we examined the risks in the early OAC use (within 1-3-6-12 days) or 
      guideline-recommended delayed use. Indirect comparison between the early and delayed 
      use was conducted using mixed treatment comparison. RESULTS:  Across the AIS 
      severity, the risks of composite or effectiveness outcome were lower in OAC users 
      than nonusers, and the risks were similar between the early and delayed use groups. 
      In patients with severe AIS, early OAC use was associated with an increased risk of 
      safety outcome, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.67 (confidence interval [CI]: 
      1·30-2·13) compared with nonusers and a HR of 1.44 (CI: 0·99-2·09) compared with the 
      delayed use. CONCLUSION:  Our study findings support an early OAC initiation in AF 
      patients with mild-to-moderate AIS and a routine delayed use of OACs can be 
      considered in those with severe AIS to avoid a serious bleeding event.

TI  - Combination anticoagulant or P2Y12 inhibitor with low-dose aspirin versus low-dose 
      aspirin alone in patients at risk or with documented coronary and/or peripheral 
      artery disease.
PG  - 27-34
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2021.1991294 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic literature review and indirect treatment 
      comparison (ITC) to identify, summarize and quantify randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT) evidence evaluating combination anticoagulant or P2Y12 inhibitor with low-dose 
      aspirin versus low-dose aspirin alone for the prevention of atherothrombotic events 
      in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or peripheral artery 
      disease (PAD). METHODS: We performed an updated search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and 
      EMBASE through 23 August 2021 to identify RCTs of adult patients with chronic CAD 
      and/or PAD that compared combination anticoagulant or P2Y12 inhibitor with low-dose 
      aspirin to low-dose aspirin alone. Outcomes of interest included major adverse 
      cardiovascular events (MACEs) including cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial 
      infarction (MI) and bleeding. When needed, outcomes were pooled using random-effects 
      models to generate hazard or risk ratios (HRs or RRs) and accompanying 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs). Adjusted ITCs using subsequent pooled HRs/RRs were then 
      performed. RESULTS: Six publications reporting the results of two unique RCTs (one 
      evaluating clopidogrel + aspirin vs. aspirin alone and the other rivaroxaban 2.5 mg 
      twice daily + aspirin vs. aspirin alone) were analyzed. The ITC suggested that 
      rivaroxaban + aspirin was associated with a lower risk of MACEs compared with 
      clopidogrel + aspirin (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68-0.98). When looking at the 
      individual components of MACE, rivaroxaban + aspirin was associated with lower risk 
      of cardiovascular death (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.57-0.98) and stroke (RR = 0.67, 95 CI 
      = 0.49-0.93) and similar risk of MI (RR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.70-1.23) versus 
      clopidogrel + aspirin. No evidence of a difference in moderate-to-severe bleeding, 
      fatal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was seen between the two treatment 
      strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to clopidogrel + low-dose aspirin, the use of 
      rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily + low-dose aspirin reduced the risk of MACE, CV death 
      and stroke including ischemic stroke in patients with or at high risk for chronic 
      CAD and/or PAD. These benefits of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily + low-dose aspirin 
      compared to clopidogrel + low-dose aspirin appear to be achieved without 
      significantly increasing patients' risk of moderate-to-severe bleeding, including 
      ICH or fatal bleeding.

TI  - Rectal indomethacin and diclofenac are equally efficient in preventing pancreatitis 
      following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in average-risk patients.
PG  - 1119-1126
LID - 10.1002/jgh3.12643 [doi]
AB  - Rectal indomethacin and diclofenac are promising drugs for prevention of 
      post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP). 
      However, their prophylactic effect on PEP in average-risk patients remains 
      controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the 
      efficacy and safety of rectal indomethacin and diclofenac in average-risk patients, 
      and to indirectly compare the prophylactic effect of the two drugs. A comprehensive 
      search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases was performed to 
      identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on rectal indomethacin or diclofenac 
      for prophylaxis against PEP. Fixed- and random-effects models weighted by the 
      Mantel-Haenszel method were used for direct comparisons. The adjusted indirect 
      treatment comparison method was used to indirectly compare the efficacy of 
      indomethacin and diclofenac. A total of 10 RCTs, including 2928 patients, met our 
      inclusion criteria. No significant publication bias was identified. Pooled estimates 
      showed that rectal indomethacin and diclofenac were associated with a significant 
      reduction in the overall risk of PEP compared with control intervention [relative 
      risk (RR) = 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.83] in average-risk patients. 
      Subgroup analyses showed that both rectal indomethacin (RR = 0.67; 95% CI: 
      0.49-0.94) and diclofenac (RR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.23-0.75) were effective in the 
      prevention of PEP. Indirect comparison showed no significant difference between the 
      effectiveness of the two drugs in the prevention of PEP (RR = 1.607; 95% CI: 
      0.824-3.136). The updated meta-analysis suggests that both drugs provide equivalent 
      protection against PEP in average-risk patients.

TI  - Population-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of maintenance PARP inhibitor with 
      or without bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone in women with newly diagnosed 
      advanced ovarian cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, bevacizumab and 
      poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, alone or in combination, have shown 
      benefit as maintenance treatment following platinum-based chemotherapy. However, no 
      trials have compared a PARP inhibitor plus bevacizumab versus a PARP inhibitor, or a 
      PARP inhibitor versus bevacizumab. We performed an unanchored population-adjusted 
      indirect treatment comparison to estimate the relative efficacy and safety of 
      maintenance treatments for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer. METHODS: 
      Analyses were performed using aggregate data from the PRIMA trial and patient-level 
      data from a subset of patients from the PAOLA-1 trial that met surgery and staging 
      eligibility criteria of PRIMA. Propensity weights were used to match baseline 
      characteristics of the PAOLA-1 subset to those of the PRIMA population. Analysis was 
      performed in overall (biomarker-unselected) and homologous recombination repair 
      deficiency (HRD)-positive populations. RESULTS: A total of 595/806 (266/387 
      HRD-positive) PAOLA-1 patients were included. After matching, the effective sample 
      size for PAOLA-1 was 532 (242 HRD-positive). Maintenance olaparib plus bevacizumab 
      reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 43% [hazard ratio (HR) 0.57; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 0.47-0.69] versus niraparib and by 40% (HR 0.60; 95% CI: 
      0.49-0.74) versus bevacizumab in the biomarker-unselected population and by 43% (HR 
      0.57; 95% CI: 0.41-0.79) and 60% (HR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.29-0.55), respectively, in the 
      HRD-positive population. Progression-free survival (PFS) benefits of maintenance 
      niraparib and bevacizumab arms were comparable in the biomarker-unselected 
      population (HR 1.07; 95% CI: 0.87-1.32); however, niraparib showed a 30% reduced 
      risk compared with bevacizumab (HR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51-0.97) in the HRD-positive 
      population. CONCLUSIONS: In biomarker-unselected and HRD-positive patients, 
      combination treatment with olaparib plus bevacizumab as maintenance treatment 
      improves PFS for women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer compared with 
      either bevacizumab or niraparib alone. Results are hypothesis generating and could 
      guide randomised trial design.

TI  - Population-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of the SOLO1 and

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of randomised head-to-head trials, we conducted a 
      population-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (PA-ITC) of phase III trial data 
      to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of maintenance olaparib and bevacizumab 
      alone and in combination in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer 
      and a BRCA mutation (BRCAm). METHODS: An unanchored PA-ITC was performed on 
      investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) data. Individual patient data 
      from SOLO1 (olaparib versus placebo) and from BRCA-mutated patients in 
      PAOLA-1/ENGOT-ov25 (olaparib plus bevacizumab versus placebo plus bevacizumab) were 
      pooled. Each arm of PAOLA-1 was weighted so that key baseline patient 
      characteristics were similar to the SOLO1 cohort. Analyses were performed in 
      patients with complete baseline data. Weighted Cox regression analysis was used to 
      estimate the comparative efficacy of different maintenance therapy strategies, 
      supplemented by weighted Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: Data from SOLO1 patients 
      (olaparib, n = 254; placebo, n = 126) were compared with data from BRCA-mutated 
      PAOLA-1 patients (olaparib plus bevacizumab, n = 151; placebo plus bevacizumab, 
      n = 71). Adding bevacizumab to olaparib was associated with a numerical improvement 
      in PFS compared with olaparib alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 0.45-1.09). Statistically significant improvements in PFS were seen with 
      olaparib alone versus placebo plus bevacizumab (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.30-0.75), olaparib 
      plus bevacizumab versus placebo (0.23; 0.14-0.34), and placebo plus bevacizumab 
      versus placebo (0.65; 0.43-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this hypothesis-generating 
      PA-ITC analysis support the use of maintenance olaparib alone or with bevacizumab in 
      patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCAm.

LID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020004045 [doi]
AB  - In the absence of head-to-head trials, an indirect-treatment comparison can estimate 
      the treatment effect of tisagenlecleucel in comparison with blinatumomab on rates of 
      complete remission (CR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed or 
      primary refractory (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patient-level data from 
      two pivotal trials, ELIANA (tisagenlecleucel; n = 79) and MT103-205 (blinatumomab; n 
      = 70), were used in comparisons of CR and OS, controlling for cross-trial difference 
      in available patient characteristics. Five different adjustment approaches were 
      implemented: stabilized inverse probability of treatment weight (sIPTW); trimmed 
      sIPTW; stratification by propensity score quintiles; adjustment for prognostic 
      factors; and adjustment for both prognostic factors and propensity score. 
      Comparative analyses indicate that treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated 
      with a statistically significant higher likelihood of achieving CR and lower hazard 
      of death than treatment with blinatumomab. The tisagenlecleucel group exhibited a 
      higher likelihood of CR than the blinatumomab group in every analysis regardless of 
      adjustment approach (odds ratios: 6.71-9.76). Tisagenlecleucel was also associated 
      with a lower hazard of death than blinatumomab in every analysis, ranging from 68% 
      to 74% lower hazard of death than with blinatumomab, determined using multiple 
      adjustment approaches (hazard ratios: 0.26-0.32). These findings support the growing 
      body of clinical trials and real-world evidence demonstrating that tisagenlecleucel 
      is an important treatment option for children and young adults with R/R ALL.

TI  - An Indirect Comparison Between Nivolumab + Ipilimumab + Two Cycles of Chemotherapy 
      vs. Pembrolizumab + Chemotherapy as First-Line Treatment for Metastatic Non-Small 
      Cell Lung Cancer.
PG  - 698199
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2021.698199 [doi]
LID - 698199
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nivolumab + ipilimumab + two cycles chemotherapy (N-I + chemo, intensive 
      immunotherapy but chemo-light) and pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (Pem + chemo) were 
      both recommended as first-line treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung 
      carcinoma (NSCLC) patients. We conducted this indirect comparison to compare the 
      efficacy of and safety between these two treatments for providing reference for 
      decision making. METHODS: Relevant databases were searched for eligible trials. A 
      well-accepted adjusted indirect treatment comparison (ITC) approach was selected to 
      pool efficacy results and safety outcomes. Subgroup analyses were stratified 
      according to PD-L1 expression and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Four eligible 
      randomized trials (CheckMate9LA, KEYNOTE-021G, KEYNOTE 189, KEYNOTE 407) involving 
      2017 patients were available to analyze. The ITC results suggested that N-I + chemo 
      is comparable to Pem + chemo in OS (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82-1.30) and ORR (RR 0.81, 95% 
      CI 0.62-1.06), but tended to yield inferior PFS (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.59) than did 
      Pem + chemo. As for safety profiles, N-I + chemo showed no significant difference 
      relative to Pem + chemo in any grade adverse events: (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.10), 
      but demonstrated reduced toxicity in chemo-related adverse events, such as anemia 
      (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81), neutropenia (RR0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.79), and 
      thrombocytopenia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21-0.69). CONCLUSIONS: N-I + chemo is a 
      promising treatment option for providing comparable OS related to Pem + chemo. 
      However, for never smoker female patients, Pem + chemo is preferable to choose for 
      demonstrating favorable OS benefit than N-I + chemo.

TI  - DREAMM-2: Indirect Comparisons of Belantamab Mafodotin vs. Selinexor + Dexamethasone 
      and Standard of Care Treatments in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.
PG  - 5501-5518
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01884-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Single-agent belantamab mafodotin (belamaf; BLENREP) demonstrated deep 
      and durable responses in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and ≥ 3 
      prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, proteasome inhibitor, 
      and anti-CD38 antibody (DREAMM-2; NCT03525678). METHODS: At the time of this study, 
      STORM Part 2, NCT02336815 (selinexor plus low-dose dexamethasone; sel + dex) was 
      systematically identified as the only feasible comparator to the DREAMM-2 cohort. 
      Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC) evaluated efficacy and safety of 
      belamaf (2.5 mg/kg; n = 97) versus sel + dex (80 mg + 20 mg, respectively; n = 123). 
      Populations were weighted for clinically validated effect modifiers and prognostic 
      factors. Outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), 
      duration of response (DoR), overall response rate (ORR), time to response (TTR), and 
      safety. The relative efficacy of belamaf versus standard of care (SoC) on OS was 
      estimated by a Bucher indirect treatment comparison using the MAIC-adjusted hazard 
      ratios (HR) for OS of belamaf (DREAMM-2) versus sel + dex (STORM Part 2) and a HR 
      adjusted for refractoriness to carfilzomib and high-risk cytogenetics of sel + dex 
      (STORM) versus SoC (MAMMOTH). RESULTS: Belamaf demonstrated improved OS (HR 0.53; 
      95% confidence interval 0.34, 0.83; p = 0.005) and DoR (0.41; 0.21, 0.83; p = 0.013) 
      versus sel + dex. There were no statistically significant differences in ORR, TTR, 
      and PFS. Belamaf had a favorable safety profile for most evaluable hematologic 
      (any-grade, Grade 3-4) and non-hematologic (any-grade) adverse events versus 
      sel + dex. Significantly improved OS was observed with belamaf versus SoC (0.29; 
      0.16, 0.54; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Single-agent belamaf represents a new treatment 
      option for triple-class refractory patients with RRMM.

AB  - There are often multiple potential interventions to treat a disease; therefore, we 
      need a method for simultaneously comparing and ranking all of these available 
      interventions. In contrast to pairwise meta-analysis, which allows for the 
      comparison of one intervention to another based on head-to-head data from randomized 
      trials, network meta-analysis (NMA) facilitates simultaneous comparison of the 
      efficacy or safety of multiple interventions that may not have been directly 
      compared in a randomized trial. NMAs help researchers study important and previously 
      unanswerable questions, which have contributed to a rapid rise in the number of NMA 
      publications in the biomedical literature. However, the conduct and interpretation 
      of NMAs are more complex than pairwise meta-analyses: there are additional NMA model 
      assumptions (i.e., network connectivity, homogeneity, transitivity, and consistency) 
      and outputs (e.g., network plots and surface under the cumulative ranking curves 
      [SUCRAs]). In this chapter, we will: (1) explore similarities and differences 
      between pairwise and network meta-analysis; (2) explain the differences between 
      direct, indirect, and mixed treatment comparisons; (3) describe how treatment 
      effects are derived from NMA models; (4) discuss key criteria predicating completion 
      of NMA; (5) interpret NMA outputs; (6) discuss areas of ongoing methodological 
      research in NMA; (7) outline an approach to conducting a systematic review and NMA; 
      (8) describe common problems that researchers encounter when conducting NMAs and 
      potential solutions; and (9) outline an approach to critically appraising a 
      systematic review and NMA.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of different methods for difficult biliary cannulation in ERCP: 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several methods with variable efficacy have been proposed for 
      difficult biliary cannulation in ERCP. We assessed the comparative efficacy of 
      different strategies for difficult biliary cannulation through a network 
      meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: We 
      identified 17 randomized controlled trials (2015 patients) that compared the 
      efficacy of different adjunctive methods for difficult biliary cannulation 
      (needle-knife techniques, pancreatic guidewire-assisted technique, 
      pancreatic-assisted technique, and transpancreatic sphincterotomy) either with each 
      other or with persistence with the standard cannulation techniques. The success rate 
      of biliary cannulation and the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) were the 
      outcomes of interest. We performed pairwise and network meta-analysis for all 
      treatments and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and 
      Evaluation criteria to appraise quality of evidence. RESULTS: Low-quality evidence 
      supported the use of transpancreatic sphincterotomy over persistence with standard 
      cannulation techniques (risk ratio [RR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.05-1.59) and over any other adjunctive intervention (RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.01-1.44] 
      vs pancreatic guidewire-assisted technique, RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.01-1.43] vs early 
      needle-knife techniques, RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.03-2.10] vs pancreatic stent-assisted 
      technique) for increasing the success rate of biliary cannulation. No other 
      significant results were observed in any other comparisons. Based on the network 
      model, transpancreatic sphincterotomy (P-score, .97) followed by early needle-knife 
      techniques (P-score, .62) were ranked highest in terms of increasing the success 
      rate of biliary cannulation. Early needle-knife techniques outperformed persistence 
      with standard cannulation techniques in terms of decreasing PEP rate (RR, .61; 95% 
      CI, .37-1.00), whereas both early needle-knife techniques and transpancreatic 
      sphincterotomy led to lower PEP rates as compared with pancreatic guidewire-assisted 
      technique (RR, .49 [95% CI, .23-.99] and .53 [95% CI, .30-.92], respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Transpancreatic sphincterotomy increases the success rate of biliary 
      cannulation as compared with persistence with the standard cannulation techniques. 
      Early needle-knife techniques and transpancreatic sphincterotomy are superior to 
      other interventions in decreasing PEP rates and should be considered in patients 
      with difficult cannulation.

TI  - Efficacy of Vibegron and Mirabegron for Overactive Bladder: A Systematic Literature 
      Review and Indirect Treatment Comparison.
PG  - 5452-5464
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01902-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of head-to-head trials, we performed an indirect 
      treatment comparison of the β(3)-adrenergic agonists vibegron and mirabegron in the 
      treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library 
      were searched for articles related to phase 3, double-blind, controlled trials of 
      vibegron 75 mg and mirabegron 25/50 mg in patients with OAB. Efficacy outcomes 
      included change from baseline at weeks 4, 12, and 52 in mean daily number of total 
      urinary incontinence episodes and micturitions and mean volume voided/micturition. 
      Effect size was computed as placebo-subtracted change from baseline (weeks 4, 12) or 
      active control (tolterodine)-subtracted change from baseline (week 52) for each 
      treatment group. Adverse events (AEs) are presented descriptively. RESULTS: After 
      removal of duplicates, 49 records were identified, and after screening 9 met 
      inclusion criteria for analysis. Vibegron showed significantly greater reduction in 
      mean daily number of total incontinence episodes than mirabegron 25 mg at week 4, 
      mirabegron 50 mg (weeks 4, 52), and tolterodine (weeks 4, 12) (P < 0.05, each) and 
      significantly greater improvement in volume voided versus mirabegron 25 mg 
      (week 12), mirabegron 50 mg (weeks 12, 52), and tolterodine (week 4) (P < 0.05, 
      each). Confidence intervals of point estimates overlapped zero for all other 
      comparisons of vibegron and mirabegron (25 or 50 mg) or tolterodine, indicating no 
      significant differences between treatments for these time/endpoints. Urinary tract 
      infection, hypertension, and dry mouth were the most commonly occurring AEs for 
      vibegron, mirabegron, and tolterodine, respectively, in the short-term trials; 
      hypertension was the most commonly occurring AE with all three treatments in the 
      long-term trials. CONCLUSIONS: Vibegron was associated with significant improvement 
      in total incontinence episodes versus mirabegron at 4 and 52 weeks and volume voided 
      at 12 and 52 weeks. Improvement in micturitions was similar between vibegron and 
      mirabegron or tolterodine. Incidence of AEs was generally comparable between 
      vibegron and mirabegron.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of randomized studies directly comparing chimeric antigen 
      receptor T cell therapies, this study used matching-adjusted indirect comparisons 
      (MAIC) to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of lisocabtagene maraleucel 
      (liso-cel) versus axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in patients with relapsed or 
      refractory large B cell lymphoma (LBCL). METHODS: Primary data sources included 
      individual patient data from the TRANSCEND NHL 001 study (TRANSCEND [NCT02631044]; 
      N = 256 for efficacy set, N = 269 for safety set) for liso-cel and summary-level 
      data from the ZUMA-1 study (NCT02348216; N = 101 for efficacy set, N = 108 for 
      safety set) for axi-cel. Inter-study differences in design, eligibility criteria, 
      baseline characteristics, and outcomes were assessed and aligned to the extent 
      feasible. Clinically relevant prognostic factors were adjusted in a stepwise fashion 
      by ranked order. Since bridging therapy was allowed in TRANSCEND but not ZUMA-1, the 
      initial efficacy and safety analyses included bridging therapy use as a matching 
      factor (TRANSCEND patients who received bridging therapy were removed). Subsequent 
      sensitivity analyses excluded this matching factor. RESULTS: The initial analysis 
      showed similar MAIC-weighted efficacy outcomes between TRANSCEND and ZUMA-1 for 
      overall and complete response rates (odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.40 
      [0.56-3.49] and 1.21 [0.56-2.64], respectively) and for overall survival and 
      progression-free survival (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.81 [0.44-1.49] and 0.95 
      [0.58-1.57], respectively). MAIC-weighted safety outcomes favored liso-cel, with 
      significantly lower odds of all-grade and grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome (odds 
      ratio [95% CI], 0.03 [0.01-0.07] and 0.08 [0.01-0.67], respectively) and 
      study-specific neurological events (0.16 [0.08-0.33] and 0.05 [0.02-0.15], 
      respectively). Efficacy and safety outcomes remained similar in sensitivity 
      analyses, which did not include use of bridging therapy as a matching factor. 
      CONCLUSIONS: After matching and adjusting for clinically relevant prognostic 
      factors, liso-cel demonstrated comparable efficacy and a more favorable safety 
      profile compared with axi-cel in patients with third- or later-line relapsed or 
      refractory LBCL. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02631044 and NCT02348216.

TI  - Comparison of monoclonal antibodies targeting CD38, SLAMF7 and PD-1/PD-L1 in 
      combination with Bortezomib/Immunomodulators plus dexamethasone/prednisone for the 
      treatment of multiple myeloma: an indirect-comparison Meta-analysis of randomised 
      controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many clinical trials have assessed the effect and safety of monoclonal 
      antibodies (MAbs) in combination with proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulators plus 
      dexamethasone/prednisone for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). The treatment 
      outcomes of comparing different MAbs in combination with the above-mentioned agents 
      remained unclear. We performed the meta-analysis to indirectly compare the effect 
      and safety of MAbs targeting CD38, SLAMF7, and PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with 
      bortezomib/immunomodulators plus dexamethasone/prednisone for patients with MM. 
      METHODS: We searched thoroughly in the databases for randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) in which at least one of the three MAbs were included. We included eleven 
      eligible RCTs with 5367 patients in the meta-analysis. Statistical analysis was 
      carried out using StataMP14 and Indirect Treatment Comparisons software. RESULTS: We 
      calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free 
      survival (PFS) and relative risk (RR) for overall response rate, complete response 
      (CR) or better, very good partial response (VGPR) or better, VGPR, partial response, 
      stable disease, and grade 3 or higher adverse events among the three groups. The HRs 
      for PFS of the CD38 group vs SLAMF7 group, CD38 group vs PD-1/PD-L1 group, and 
      SLAMF7 group vs PD-1/PD-L1 group were 0.662 (95%CI 0.543-0.806), 0.317 (95%CI 
      0.221-0.454), and 0.479 (95%CI 0.328-0.699), respectively. The HR for OS of the CD38 
      group vs SLAMF7 group was 0.812 (95%CI 0.584-1.127). The RR for CR or better in the 
      CD38 group vs SLAMF7 group was 2.253 (95%CI 1.284-3.955). The RR for neutropenia of 
      the CD38 group vs SLAMF7 group was 1.818 (95%CI 1.41-2.344). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment 
      with the CD38 group had longer PFS and better treatment response than that with the 
      SLAMF7 or PD-1/PD-L1 group. In addition, the SLAMF7 group prolonged PFS compared 
      with the PD-1/PD-L1 group and was associated with a lower incidence of grade 3 or 
      higher neutropenia than the CD38 and PD-1/PD-L1 group. In conclusion, MAbs targeting 
      CD38 are the best, followed by those targeting SLAMF7; MAbs targeting PD-1/PD-L1 are 
      the worst when in combination with bortezomib/immunomodulators plus 
      dexamethasone/prednisone for the treatment of MM.

TI  - Enhanced Visualization Methods for First Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumour 
      in Suspected Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer: A Health Technology Assessment.
PG  - 1-123
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer begins in the innermost lining of the bladder wall and, 
      on histological examination, is classified as one of two types: non-muscle-invasive 
      bladder cancer (NMIBC) or muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Transurethral resection of 
      bladder tumour (TURBT) is the standard treatment for people with NMIBC, but the high 
      rate of cancer recurrence after first TURBT is a challenge that physicians and 
      patients face. Tumours seen during follow-up may have been missed or incompletely 
      resected during first TURBT. TURBT is conventionally performed using white light to 
      see the tumours. However, small papillary or flat tumours may be missed with the use 
      of white light alone. With the emergence of new technologies to improve 
      visualization during TURBT, better diagnostic and patient outcomes may be expected. 
      We conducted a health technology assessment of two enhanced visualization methods, 
      both as an adjunct to white light to guide first TURBT for people with suspected 
      NMIBC-hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL), a solution that is instilled into the 
      bladder to make tumours fluoresce under blue-violet light, and narrow band imaging 
      (NBI), a technology that filters light into wavelengths that can be absorbed by 
      hemoglobin in the tumours, making them appear darker. Our assessment included an 
      evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, and the budget impact of 
      publicly funding these new technologies to improve patient outcomes following first 
      TURBT. The use of NBI in diagnostic cystoscopy was out of scope for this health 
      technology assessment. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the 
      clinical evidence from inception to April 15, 2020. We searched for randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the outcomes of first TURBT with the use of 
      HAL or NBI, both as an adjunct to white light, with the outcomes of first TURBT 
      using white light alone, or studies that made such comparison between HAL and NBI. 
      We conducted pairwise meta-analyses using a fixed effects model where head-to-head 
      comparisons were available. In the absence of any published RCT for comparison 
      between HAL and NBI, we indirectly compared the two technologies through indirect 
      treatment comparison (ITC) analysis. We assessed the risk of bias of each included 
      study using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We assessed the quality of the body of 
      evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and 
      Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic 
      literature search and conducted a cost-utility analysis with a 15-year time horizon 
      from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly 
      funding HAL and NBI as an adjunct to white light in people undergoing their first 
      TURBT for suspected non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in Ontario. RESULTS: In the 
      clinical evidence review, we identified 8 RCTs that used HAL or NBI as an adjunct to 
      white light during first TURBT. Pairwise meta-analysis of HAL studies showed that 
      HAL-guided TURBT as an adjunct to white light significantly reduces recurrence rate 
      at 12 months compared with TURBT using white light alone (risk ratio 0.70, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.95) (GRADE: Moderate). Five-year recurrence-free 
      survival was significantly higher when HAL was used as an adjunct to white light 
      than when white light was used alone (GRADE: Moderate). There was little to no 
      difference in the tumour progression rate (GRADE: Moderate).Meta-analysis of NBI 
      studies did not show a significant difference between NBI-guided TURBT as an adjunct 
      to white light and TURBT using white light alone in reducing the rate of recurrence 
      at 12 months (risk ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.75-1.19) (GRADE: Moderate). No evidence on 
      the effect on recurrence-free survival or tumour progression rate was identified for 
      NBI-guided TURBT. The indirect estimate from the network analysis showed a trend 
      toward a lower rate of recurrence after HAL-guided TURBT than after NBI-guided TURBT 
      but the difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI 
      0.51-1.11) (GRADE: Low). Studies showed that use of HAL or NBI during TURBT was 
      generally safe.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of HAL-guided TURBT compared 
      with NBI-guided TURBT, both as an adjunct to white light, is $12,618 per 
      quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared with TURBT using white light 
      alone and using adjunct NBI, the probability of HAL-guided TURBT being 
      cost-effective is 69.1% at a willingness-to-pay value of $50,000 per QALY gained and 
      74.6% at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY gained. The annual budget impact 
      of publicly funding HAL-guided TURBT in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from an 
      additional $0.6 million in year 1 to $2.5 million in year 5. CONCLUSIONS: First 
      TURBT guided by HAL as an adjunct to white light likely reduces the rate of 
      recurrence at 12 months and increases 5-year recurrence-free survival when compared 
      with first TURBT using white light alone. There is likely little to no difference in 
      the tumour progression rate. First TURBT guided by NBI as an adjunct to white light 
      likely results in little to no difference in the rate of recurrence at 12 months 
      when compared with first TURBT using white light alone. Based on an indirect 
      comparison, there may be little to no difference in cancer recurrence rate between 
      HAL-guided and NBI-guided first TURBT. Use of HAL or NBI during first TURBT is 
      generally safe. For people undergoing their first TURBT for suspected 
      non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, using HAL as an adjunct to white light is likely 
      to be cost-effective compared with using white light alone or with using NBI as an 
      adjunct to white light. We estimate that publicly funding HAL as an adjunct to white 
      light to guide first TURBT for people in Ontario with suspected NMIBC would result 
      in additional costs of between $0.6 million and $2.5 million per year over the next 
      5 years.

TI  - Belantamab mafodotin for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in 
      heavily pretreated patients: a US cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 1137-1145
LID - 10.1080/17474086.2021.1970522 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) require 
      several lines of therapy, with typically shorter remission duration with each 
      additional line. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of belantamab 
      mafodotin (belamaf; DREAMM-2; NCT03525678) was compared with selinexor plus 
      dexamethasone (SEL+DEX; STORM Part 2; NCT02336815) among patients with RRMM who have 
      received at least four prior therapies. The base case used a US commercial payer's 
      perspective over a 10-year time horizon. Efficacy data were based on parametric 
      survival analysis of DREAMM-2 and matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison 
      between DREAMM-2 and STORM Part 2, which assessed relative treatment effects between 
      belamaf and SEL+DEX. Cost inputs included drug treatment, concomitant medications, 
      adverse event management, subsequent treatments, and disease management. RESULTS: 
      Belamaf decreased total treatment costs per patient by $14,267 and increased patient 
      life years by 0.74 and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.49 versus SEL+DEX. 
      Patients receiving belamaf accrued 0.12 fewer progression-free life years versus 
      patients on SEL+DEX. CONCLUSIONS: From a US commercial payer's perspective, belamaf 
      had lower costs, and increased QALYs and life-year gain, compared with SEL+DEX. 
      Belamaf is therefore likely to be a cost-effective treatment option for patients 
      with RRMM who have received four or more prior lines of therapy.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of pegcetacoplan versus ravulizumab in patients with 
      paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria previously treated with eculizumab: a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 1913-1923
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2021.1971182 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the absence of a head-to-head study, we assessed the comparative 
      effectiveness of pegcetacoplan, a targeted C3 complement inhibitor, vs. ravulizumab, 
      a C5 complement inhibitor, among patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria 
      (PNH) previously treated with eculizumab using matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      methodology. METHODS: Individual patient data from the PEGASUS study (NCT03500549) 
      comparing pegcetacoplan and eculizumab enabled adjustment for baseline differences 
      compared with published results from the ALXN1210-PNH-302 study (NCT03056040), 
      comparing ravulizumab and eculizumab. Adjusted differences and 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) were computed via weighted Wald tests for comparisons of 
      pegcetacoplan vs. ravulizumab, anchored to the common comparator eculizumab. 
      RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients from PEGASUS (36 pegcetacoplan; 32 eculizumab) and 195 
      from ALXN1210-PNH-302 (97 ravulizumab; 98 eculizumab) were included. Compared with 
      ravulizumab, treatment with pegcetacoplan was associated with more transfusion 
      avoidance (adjusted difference [95% CI] = +71.4% [53.5%, 89.3%]), hemoglobin level 
      stabilization (+75.5% [56.4%, 94.6%]), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level 
      normalization (+64.0% [41.8%, 86.1%]), and fewer blood transfusions (-5.7 units 
      [-7.2, -4.2]). Additionally, patients who received pegcetacoplan experienced 
      clinically meaningful improvements in fatigue (+8.2 points [3.8, 12.6]), global 
      health status (+9.6 points [0.1, 19.0]), physical functioning (+11.5 points [3.6, 
      19.5]), and fatigue symptoms (-13.3 points [-23.7, -3.0]), compared with 
      ravulizumab. Mean change from baseline in LDH level was not significantly different 
      for pegcetacoplan vs. ravulizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that among patients 
      previously treated with eculizumab, clinical, hematological, and quality of life 
      endpoints were better for patients who received the C3 complement inhibitor 
      pegcetacoplan vs. patients who received ravulizumab, a C5 complement inhibitor.

TI  - Indirect treatment comparison of solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil for 
      excessive daytime sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea.
PG  - 2543-2555
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.9610 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep 
      apnea affects 9%-22% of continuous positive airway pressure-treated patients. An 
      indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis was performed to compare efficacy and 
      safety of medications (solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil) approved to treat 
      excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea. METHODS: 
      Efficacy and safety measures assessed in this indirect treatment comparison included 
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), 20-minute Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT20), 
      Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), Functional Outcomes of Sleep 
      Questionnaire (FOSQ), and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (any, 
      serious, or leading to discontinuation). RESULTS: A systematic literature review 
      identified 6 parallel-arm, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials that 
      randomized 1,714 total participants to placebo, solriamfetol, modafinil, or 
      armodafinil. In this indirect treatment comparison, all comparators were associated 
      with greater improvements than placebo on the ESS, MWT20, and CGI-C after 4, 8, and 
      12 weeks of treatment. Relative to comparators and placebo at 12 weeks, solriamfetol 
      at 150 mg or 300 mg had the highest probabilities of improvement in the ESS, MWT20, 
      and CGI-C. Modafinil (200 or 400 mg) and solriamfetol (150 or 300 mg) were 
      associated with greater improvement on the FOSQ than placebo at 12 weeks. Less than 
      2% of patients using placebo or comparators experienced serious or 
      discontinuation-related treatment-emergent adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      of this indirect treatment comparison show 12 weeks of treatment with solriamfetol, 
      modafinil, and armodafinil resulted in varying levels of improvement on the ESS, 
      MWT20, and CGI-C and similar safety risks in participants with excessive daytime 
      sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea. CITATION: Ronnebaum S, Bron M,

TI  - Efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi versus IDegAsp: Results of a systematic literature 
      review and indirect treatment comparison.
PG  - 2660-2669
LID - 10.1111/dom.14518 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi, a fixed-ratio combination of 
      basal insulin glargine 100 U/mL and lixisenatide (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
      agonist) versus IDegAsp, a co-formulation of basal insulin degludec 100 U/mL with 
      rapid-acting insulin aspart. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search 
      of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. Outcomes from eligible RCTs 
      were compared by an indirect treatment comparison using a Bayesian framework. 
      Subanalyses of Japanese and international trials were performed. RESULTS: Eight RCTs 
      (duration 26-30 weeks) were included. Mean difference in HbA1c change with iGlarLixi 
      exceeded that for IDegAsp: -0.64 (95% credible interval -1.01, -0.28) %-units (-7.0 
      [-11.0, -3.1] mmol/mol) for all trials, -0.39 (-0.55, -0.23) %-units (-4.3 [-6.0, 
      -2.5] mmol/mol) for international, and -0.88 (-1.11, -0.64) %-units (-9.6 [-12.1, 
      -7.0] mmol/mol) for Japanese trials. HbA1c target achievement (<7.0%-units 
      [<53 mmol/mol]) was greater for iGlarLixi in all trials (odds ratio 2.50 [1.06, 
      5.56]) and Japanese trials (2.17 [1.27, 3.70]), but not in international trials 
      (2.17 [0.42, 11.11]). Analyses suggesting differences in mean postmeal self-measured 
      plasma glucose were significantly lower by 1.0-2.0 mmol/L (18-36 mg/dL) with 
      iGlarLixi in all analyses. Bodyweight change was more favourable (1-2 kg) for 
      iGlarLixi versus IDegAsp for all analyses (P < 0.05). Comparisons of hypoglycaemia 
      were inconclusive owing to differences in definitions between studies. Adverse 
      events were more frequent with iGlarLixi because of gastrointestinal intolerance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: iGlarLixi appears to offer clinical benefit in glucose control and 
      bodyweight change in people needing both basal and meal-time intervention.

TI  - Indirect comparisons of siponimod with fingolimod and ofatumumab in multiple 
      sclerosis: assessing the feasibility of propensity score matching analyses.
PG  - 1933-1944
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2021.1968362 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Head-to-head trials comparing siponimod with fingolimod or ofatumumab in 
      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are lacking. Instead, the comparative efficacy 
      of siponimod can be derived from indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs). We assessed 
      the suitability of ITCs leveraging individual patient data from relevant phase III 
      trials across different MS phenotypes. METHODS: One siponimod trial in patients with 
      secondary progressive MS (SPMS), four fingolimod trials (three in 
      relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS], and one in primary progressive MS [PPMS]), and two 
      ofatumumab trials in relapsing MS (RMS) were considered. The suitability of ITCs was 
      evaluated based on trial design, patient eligibility criteria, baseline patient 
      characteristics, placebo response, and outcome definitions for each trial. Analyses 
      deemed feasible were conducted using one-to-one propensity score matching (PSM). 
      RESULTS: An ITC between siponimod in SPMS and either fingolimod in RRMS or 
      ofatumumab in RMS was not feasible because of insufficient overlap in key patient 
      characteristics (e.g. disability level and relapse history) and differences in 
      placebo response. However, a comparison between siponimod in SPMS and fingolimod in 
      PPMS was feasible because of sufficient overlap in eligibility criteria and baseline 
      characteristics. One-to-one PSM demonstrated siponimod was favored relative to 
      fingolimod for time to 6- and 3-month confirmed disability progression though not 
      significantly different (hazard ratio 0.76 [95% confidence interval 0.48-1.20; 
      p-value = .240] and hazard ratio 0.80 [95% confidence interval 0.52-1.22; 
      p-value = .300], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: For trials in MS, clinical phenotype is 
      an important determinant of ITC feasibility. An ITC between siponimod in SPMS and 
      either fingolimod in RRMS or ofatumumab in RMS was not feasible. The only feasible 
      comparison was between siponimod in SPMS and fingolimod in PPMS.

TI  - Nail Psoriasis and Quality-of-Life Measurement in Clinical Trials: Call for the Use 
      of Nail-Specific Instruments.
PG  - 747-755
LID - 10.1007/s40257-021-00622-7 [doi]
AB  - Nail involvement is frequent in people with psoriasis. It can considerably impair 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) beyond the impairments due to other psoriasis 
      symptoms, for example, because patients feel ashamed of visible nail defects or 
      because of the functional impairment in manual activities and walking. In clinical 
      trials on nail psoriasis, it is therefore crucial to assess whether the treatment 
      reduces HRQoL impairments that are specific to nail psoriasis. For this purpose, two 
      validated patient questionnaires are available, the Nail Psoriasis Quality of Life 
      Scale (NPQ10) and the Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis-Quality 
      of Life (NAPPA-QOL). The ten-item NPQ10 has the advantage of being short and thus 
      quick to administer. The 20-item NAPPA-QOL, in contrast, assesses the different 
      dimensions of HRQoL which is considered a multi-dimensional construct. Yet most 
      randomized controlled trials on nail psoriasis do not evaluate HRQoL improvement. If 
      they do, a number of different instruments are used, most of which are not nail 
      specific. This makes comparison of trial outcomes difficult. Harmonizing the 
      measurement of HRQoL in future clinical trials on nail psoriasis would improve 
      comparability across studies and would also enhance the reliability of 
      meta-analyses.

TI  - How Assessment-Schedule Matching Limits Bias When Comparing Progression-Free 
      Survival in Single-Arm Studies: An Application in Second-Line Urothelial Carcinoma 
      Treatments.
PG  - 1137-1144
LID - S1098-3015(21)00163-7 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Population-adjusted comparisons of progression-free survival (PFS) from 
      single-arm trials of cancer treatments can be derived using matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparisons (MAICs); however, results are still susceptible to bias, 
      particularly if the trials had different tumor assessment schedules. This study aims 
      to assess the effects of assessment-schedule matching (ASM) on the relative 
      effectiveness on the PFS of avelumab versus approved comparator immunotherapies or 
      chemotherapy after population matching in the second-line (2L) setting for 
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma. METHODS: The MAIC used patient-level data for 
      avelumab from the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial (NCT01772004). PFS was compared with 
      published curves for other treatments to obtain population-adjusted hazard ratios 
      (HRs). The MAIC was repeated after conducting ASM for differences in tumor 
      assessment scheduled first at 6 weeks for avelumab and durvalumab and at 8 or 9 
      weeks for other treatments. RESULTS: MAIC adjustment alone altered the HR estimates 
      up to 23%, whereas MAIC plus ASM resulted in up to 32.7% reductions from naive 
      comparisons. Even in cases in which MAIC had little effect, ASM brought an 
      additional change of 11.1% to 15.4%. Overall, the HR range of avelumab versus other 
      treatments changed from 0.83 to 1.25 for naive comparisons to 0.76 to 0.99 after ASM 
      plus MAIC, numerically favoring avelumab. CONCLUSIONS: Small variations in 
      assessment schedules can introduce bias in unanchored indirect treatment comparisons 
      of interval-censored time-to-event outcomes. In this study, adjusted PFS was 
      comparable across second-line urothelial carcinoma treatment options, numerically 
      favoring avelumab versus immunotherapies and chemotherapy agents. Correcting this 
      bias is especially important when HRs are applied in cost-effectiveness models to 
      transition patients between states.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Single-arm trial (SAT) data is increasingly reviewed for drug approvals 
      by regulators and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies. Supplementary data in 
      the form of external comparators (ECs) can be used to provide clinical context to 
      support these drug evaluations. In this study we characterized HTAs for SAT-based 
      submissions, the use of supplementary EC data and outcomes from HTA review. METHODS: 
      HTA Accelerator database was used to describe SAT-based HTA submissions with 
      decisions (2011-2019). RESULTS: A total of 433 SAT-based HTA submissions were 
      identified between 2011 and 2019 with a 13-fold increase during this period. Around 
      65%(283/433) were in oncology or hem-oncology. Around 52%(226/433) of submissions 
      contained some type of EC data, including prior clinical trials (24%, 104) and 
      real-world data (RWD) (20%, 87), but 40%(175) contained no EC data. The overall 
      acceptance rate for SAT-based submissions was 48% and with RWD EC data acceptance 
      was 59%. In the latest 5-year period (2015-2019), use of RWD ECs increased 22% as a 
      proportion of submissions per year, whereas, prior trial ECs decreased (-14%) and 
      use of no EC remained stable (-2%). Between 2015 to 2017 and 2018 to 2019, 
      acceptance rate for RWD ECs increased by 20% (41% in 2015-2017 to 61% in 2018-2019) 
      whereas prior trial EC use decreased by 10% and no EC submissions decreased 16%. Of 
      226 submissions using ECs, only 29%(66) used an adjusted indirect treatment 
      comparison method. CONCLUSIONS: SAT-based submissions to HTA bodies are rapidly 
      evolving in terms of composition and acceptance. Types of EC and methodological 
      approach used are important determinants of positive outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the histological and ultrastructural changes of the otopoint 
      "Stomach" (MA-IC) area in chronic gastritis rabbits so as to provide a foundation 
      for auricular acupoint diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A total of 20 New Zealand 
      rabbits (half male and half female) were randomly and equally divided into control 
      and model groups. The chronic gastritis model was established by gavage of 5% sodium 
      salicylate each day for 5 weeks, while the rabbits of the control group received 
      gavage of clear water at the same volume. Morphological changes of the tissues of 
      gastric mucosa, otopoint "Stomach" and auricular control point were observed under 
      light microscope after staining with hematoxylin-eosin (H.E.), and given scores (0-3 
      points) according to the levels of inflammatory cells. The ultrastructural changes 
      of the otopoint "Stomach" tissue were observed under transmission electronic 
      microscope (TEM). RESULTS: H.E. staining revealed smoothness of the gastric smooth 
      muscle with no or a few of inflammatory cells in the control group, and appearance 
      of gastric mucosal hemorrhage and erosion, slightly disordered epithelial glands and 
      infiltration of a large number of lymphocytes in the mucosal layer with some 
      clustered lymphocyte aggregation foci in the model group. The pathological score of 
      gastric mucous in the model group was significantly higher than that in the control 
      group (P<0.01). Under light microscope, no obvious changes were observed in the skin 
      of the otopoint "Stomach" of the control group and the control point of the model 
      group, whereas hyperplasia and abscission in the epidermic cuticle and spinous layer 
      and basal layer, dermal tissue and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in 
      the otopoint "Stomach" of the model group. Results of TEM observation showed no 
      significant changes in the ultrastructure of the otopoint "Stomach" in the control 
      group, and swollen and vacuolated epidermal keratinocyte mitochondria, reduced 
      keratin filament aggregation, widened local cell space, unclear desmosome structure, 
      activation of the dermal fibroblasts, and an increase of the myelinated nerve 
      mitochondria in the "Stomach" region in the model group. CONCLUSION: The otopoint 
      "Stomach" tissue has structural damage and hyperplasia in chronic gastritis rabbits, 
      suggesting a special correlation between the otopoint "Stomach" and gastric tissue, 
      hence, providing a morphological basis for otopoint diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Efficacy and Consumption of 
      rVIII-SingleChain Versus Two Recombinant FVIII Products Used for Prophylactic 
      Treatment of Adults/Adolescents with Severe Haemophilia A.
PG  - 4872-4884
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01853-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Given the relatively small number of patients with haemophilia A, 
      head-to-head comparisons between recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products are difficult 
      to conduct. This study compared the efficacy and consumption of rVIII-SingleChain 
      (lonoctocog alfa, AFSTYLA(®)) with rAHF-PFM (octocog alfa, Advate(®)) and rFVIIIFc 
      (efmoroctocog alfa, Elocta(®)), for the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding 
      episodes in previously treated adolescents/adults with severe haemophilia A, through 
      a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). METHODS: A systematic literature 
      review identified published clinical trials for rAHF-PFM and rFVIIIFc. Individual 
      patient data for rVIII-SingleChain were used to match baseline patient 
      characteristics to those from published trials, using an approach similar to 
      propensity score weighting. After matching, annualized bleeding rates (ABR), 
      percentage of patients with zero bleeds, and rFVIII consumption were compared across 
      trial populations. RESULTS: Published data were identified from two rAHF-PFM trials 
      and one rFVIIIFc trial. rVIII-SingleChain had similar ABR (risk ratio [RR]: 0.74 
      [0.16; 3.48]; RR: 1.18 [0.85; 1.65]) and percentage of patients with zero bleeds 
      (odds ratio [OR]: 1.34 [0.56; 3.22]; OR: 0.78 [0.47; 1.31]) versus rAHF-PFM and 
      rFVIIIFc, respectively. Annual rVIII-SingleChain consumption was significantly lower 
      than rAHF-PFM (mean difference: - 1507.66 IU/kg/year [- 2011.71; - 1003.61]) and 
      equivalent to rFVIIIFc (RR: 0.96 [0.62; 1.49]). CONCLUSION: Although limited to 
      published information for comparator trials, these results suggest that with an 
      annualized rFVIII consumption comparable to rFVIIIFc, but significantly lower than 
      rAHF-PFM, routine prophylaxis with rVIII-SingleChain is able to maintain a similar 
      ABR and percentage of patients with zero bleeds, attesting to the long-acting nature 
      of rVIII-SingleChain.

OAB - It is difficult to directly compare different recombinant FVIII products in 
      head-to-head studies because there are few patients with haemophilia A. This study 
      aimed to indirectly compare the efficacy and consumption of different recombinant 
      FVIII products in the prophylactic treatment of haemophilia A using published 
      clinical data. A proven method for performing indirect comparisons of products is 
      referred to as a matching-adjusted indirect comparison. Using this approach, we were 
      able to compare rVIII-SingleChain with two other recombinant FVIII products 
      (rAHF-PFM and rFVIIIFc). Our results suggest that annual FVIII consumption with 
      rVIII-SingleChain is comparable to rFVIIIFc, but is significantly lower than 
      rAHF-PFM, while maintaining a similar bleeding rate. These results highlight the 
      long-acting nature of the product.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and established 
      cardiovascular disease in China.

LID - 46
AB  - BACKGROUND: In several cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), empagliflozin (SGLT-2 
      inhibitor), sitagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) and liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor 
      agonist) + standard of care (SoC) were compared to SoC in patients with type 2 
      diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study assessed the 
      cost-effectiveness (CE) of empagliflozin + SoC in comparison to sitagliptin + SoC 
      and liraglutide + SoC based on the respective CVOT. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes 
      Model (CDM) was calibrated to reproduce the CVOT outcomes. EMPA-REG OUTCOME baseline 
      characteristics and CVOT specific treatment effects on risk factors for 
      cardiovascular disease (HbA1c, BMI, blood pressure, lipids) were applied. Three-year 
      observed cardiovascular events of empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and 
      liraglutide + SoC were derived from EMPA-REG OUTCOME and an indirect treatment 
      comparison. Relative risk adjustments to calibrate the CDM were obtained after a 
      trial and error process to match as closely the observed and CDM-predicted outcomes. 
      The drug-specific treatment effects were considered up until HbA1c reached 8.5% and 
      treatment switch occurred. After this switch, the United Kingdom Prospective 
      Diabetes Study 82 risk equations predicted events based on co-existing risk factors 
      and treatment intensification to basal bolus insulin were applied. The analysis was 
      conducted from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system applying 3% 
      discounting. The time horizon was lifelong. RESULTS: Empagliflozin + SoC provides 
      additional Quality Adjusted Life years (QALY + 0.564) for an incremental cost of 
      42,497RMB (US$6053) compared to sitagliptin + SoC, resulting in an Incremental Cost 
      Utility Ratio of 75,349RMB (US$10,732), thus below the willingness-to-pay threshold 
      of 212,676RMB, corresponding to three times the Gross Domestic Product in China 
      (2019). Compared to liraglutide + SoC, empagliflozin + SoC use leads to 0.211QALY 
      gained and cost savings of 71,427RMB (US$10,173) and is as such dominant. Scenario 
      and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results. 
      CONCLUSION: Results suggest that empagliflozin + SoC is cost-effective compared to 
      sitagliptin + SoC and liraglutide + SoC at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
      212,676RMB ($30,292)/QALY.

TI  - Comparative efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of abobotulinumtoxinA and 
      onabotulinumtoxinA in children with upper limb spasticity: a systematic literature 
      review, indirect treatment comparison, and economic evaluation.
PG  - 949-961
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2021.1957582 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare clinical- and 
      cost-effectiveness of type A botulinum toxin (BoNT-A) therapies for management of 
      pediatric upper limb spasticity, including AbobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A) and 
      Onabotulinumtoxin A (onaBoNT-A). METHODS: Systematic literature review and indirect 
      treatment comparisons were conducted of randomized controlled trials reporting 
      efficacy and safety outcomes. Efficacy was characterized by Modified Ashworth Scale 
      (MAS) and Ashworth Scale (AS) up to 16-weeks post-injection. Results were used to 
      inform a cost-effectiveness model with a 1-year time horizon, linking response rates 
      with health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes and costs from a UK 
      perspective. Other data sources included in the cost-effectiveness model were drug 
      unit costs, health care resource utilization based on UK physician survey, and HRQoL 
      impacts of adverse events associated with oral anti-spasticity therapies. Results 
      were characterized as cost per quality-adjusted life year and cost per responder. 
      RESULTS: Six studies were included in evidence syntheses. There was a trend towards 
      greater response rate for aboBoNT-A which resulted in improved HRQoL and lower 
      annual costs compared with onaBoNT-A. Safety outcomes were similar across BoNT-A 
      therapies. In cost-effectiveness analysis, aboBoNT-A was an economically dominant 
      therapy with respect to cost per quality-adjusted life year. The cost per responder 
      at 1 year was estimated to be £39,056 for aboBoNT-A vs. £54,831 for onaBoNT-A. 
      LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on observed safety and efficacy data, aboBoNT-A 
      is estimated to result in higher treatment response and consequently increased 
      quality-of-life and reduced costs, vs. onaBoNT-A in children with upper limb 
      spasticity. Limitations to the study include study heterogeneity limited details 
      available for onaBoNT-A studies (e.g. use of physical therapy), and limited 
      availability of responder data. Where assumptions were required, they were made to 
      be conservative towards aboBoN-A.

AB  - Network meta-analyses (NMAs) simultaneously estimate the effects of multiple 
      possible treatment options for a given clinical presentation. For allergists to 
      benefit optimally from NMAs, they must understand the process and be able to 
      interpret the results. Through a worked example published in Pediatric Allergy and 
      Immunology, we summarize how to identify credible NMAs and interpret them with a 
      focus on recent innovations in the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations 
      Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). NMAs build on traditional systematic 
      reviews and meta-analyses that consider only direct paired comparisons by including 
      indirect evidence, thus allowing the simultaneous assessment of the relative effect 
      of all pairs of competing alternatives. Our framework informs clinicians of how to 
      identify credible NMAs and address the certainty of the evidence. Trustworthy NMAs 
      fill a critical gap in providing key inferences using direct and indirect evidence 
      to inform clinical decision making when faced with more than two competing courses 
      of treatment options. This document will help allergists to identify trustworthy 
      NMAs to enhance patient care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Modified FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GEM-NAB) have 
      been recommended as first-line therapies for advanced pancreatic cancer (PC). Due to 
      the lack of evidence to directly compare them, we conducted this network 
      meta-analysis to indirectly compare the effectiveness and toxicity of modified 
      FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB. METHODS: The eligible retrospective studies on treatments 
      related to modified FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB up to 4 April 2020 were searched and 
      assessed. We used the frequentist model to analyze the survival and toxicity data 
      between different treatments. Pooled analysis for overall survival (OS), 
      progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and events of 
      toxicity were analyzed in this study. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were involved in 
      this network meta-analysis. The comparisons on OS and PFS showed that modified 
      FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB had similar treatment efficacy (OS: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.78-1.63; 
      PFS: HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.85-1.67). GEM-NAB was more effective than modified 
      FOLFIRINOX based on the result of ORR (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.04-1.96). Moreover, our 
      analysis showed a similar toxicity profile between modified FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence showed that modified FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB were 
      similar in survival and toxicity. Many factors should be considered for in the 
      formulation of optimal treatment, and our meta-analysis could provide some guidance 
      to treatment selection in the first-line setting for advanced PC.

TI  - Cost-Minimization Analysis of Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Versus Nivolumab in 
      Combination with Ipilimumab as First-Line Treatment for Metastatic PD-L1-Positive 
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A US Payer Perspective.
PG  - 765-778
LID - 10.1007/s41669-021-00288-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab monotherapy and nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab 
      are US FDA-approved first-line (1L) regimens for patients with metastatic non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic 
      lymphoma kinase genomic aberrations and with a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
      tumor proportion score (TPS) of ≥ 1%. A published matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison found the two regimens yield comparable overall and progression-free 
      survival outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare direct medical 
      costs of pembrolizumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab for PD-L1-positive metastatic 
      NSCLC treatment within the first 3 years following treatment initiation from a US 
      payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-minimization model was built to estimate and 
      compare treatment, disease management, and adverse event costs based on KEYNOTE-024 
      and -042, and CheckMate 227 Part 1a trial survival and adverse event data. RESULTS: 
      1L pembrolizumab generates $54,343, $75,744, and $76,259 per patient cost savings 
      compared with 1L nivolumab plus ipilimumab for patients with NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 
      1% within 1, 2, and 3 years of treatment initiation, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Pembrolizumab is cost saving as 1L treatment for PD-L1-positive metastatic NSCLC in 
      comparison with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, at least for the short term.

TI  - An indirect treatment comparison of the efficacy of semaglutide 1.0 mg versus 
      dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg.
PG  - 2513-2520
LID - 10.1111/dom.14497 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To compare the effects of semaglutide 1.0 mg versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg 
      on HbA1c and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      Bucher indirect comparison was conducted to compare efficacy outcomes of semaglutide 
      1.0 mg versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg using published results from the SUSTAIN 7 
      and AWARD-11 trials. Sensitivity analyses using individual patient data from SUSTAIN 
      7 and aggregate data from AWARD-11 were conducted to explore the impact of 
      adjustment for cross-trial imbalances in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: 
      Semaglutide 1.0 mg significantly reduced HbA1c versus dulaglutide 3.0 mg, with an 
      estimated treatment difference (ETD) of -0.24%-points (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      -0.43, -0.05), with comparable reductions in HbA1c versus dulaglutide 4.5 mg with an 
      ETD of -0.07%-points (95% CI -0.26, 0.12). Semaglutide 1.0 mg significantly reduced 
      body weight versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg with an ETD of -2.65 kg (95% CI -3.57, 
      -1.73) and -1.95 kg (95% CI -2.87, -1.03), respectively. Sensitivity analyses 
      supported the primary analysis findings. CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison 
      showed significantly greater reductions in HbA1c with semaglutide 1.0 mg versus 
      dulaglutide 3.0 mg and comparable HbA1c reductions versus dulaglutide 4.5 mg. 
      Semaglutide 1.0 mg significantly reduced body weight versus both dulaglutide 3.0 and 
      4.5 mg. With several glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists available, 
      information regarding their comparative efficacy can be valuable to clinicians.

TI  - Efficacy of rFIXFc versus rIX-FP for the Treatment of Patients with Hemophilia B: 
      Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of B-LONG and PROLONG-9FP Trials.
PG  - 613-621
LID - 10.2147/JBM.S312885 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In patients with hemophilia B, treatment with extended half-life (EHL) 
      recombinant factor IX allows for longer dosing intervals while providing equal or 
      superior bleeding protection compared with standard half-life products. This enables 
      flexible, individualized treatment schedules, which reduce the burden of prophylaxis 
      and improve patient outcomes. This analysis compared the efficacy of recombinant 
      factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) and recombinant factor IX albumin fusion 
      protein (rIX-FP), two EHL therapies approved for prophylaxis and treatment of 
      bleeding in hemophilia B. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect treatment 
      comparison (MAIC) was used to adjust the between-treatment differences in baseline 
      characteristics. Individual patient data for rFIXFc (B-LONG) were matched to 
      aggregated data for rIX-FP (PROLONG-9FP) followed by statistical comparison for 
      estimated annualized bleeding rate (ABR) using a Poisson regression model with 
      adjustment for over dispersion. Data were analyzed according to treatment regimen 
      prior to study entry: prior prophylaxis (rFIXFc, n=48; rIX-FP, n=40) or prior 
      episodic treatment (n=43 and n=19, respectively). Relative treatment effects are 
      presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
      RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline characteristics, estimated ABR observed for 
      rFIXFc and rIX-FP was not significantly different in patients on prior prophylaxis 
      (1.87 versus 1.58; IRR 1.18, 95% CI 0.67-2.10) or prior episodic (2.25 versus 2.22; 
      IRR 1.01 95% CI 0.40-2.57) regimens. CONCLUSION: This MAIC analysis shows that the 
      estimated ABR for rFIXFc-treated patients from B-LONG was similar to that of 
      rIX-FP-treated patients from PROLONG-9FP and, therefore, indicates that the two EHL 
      therapies provide similar efficacy when used as prophylaxis for patients with 
      hemophilia B. Trough levels differ between the two products (1-3% [targeted] versus 
      20% [observed], respectively), suggesting that trough level is not a surrogate 
      indicator when ABR is used as a criterion for clinical efficacy when comparing these 
      FIX products in hemophilia B.

AB  - Purpose Machine learning is an attractive tool for identifying heterogeneous 
      treatment effects (HTE) of interventions but generalizability of machine learning 
      derived HTE remains unclear. We examined generalizability of HTE detected using 
      causal forests in two similarly designed randomized trials in type II diabetes 
      patients. Methods We evaluated published HTE of intensive versus standard glycemic 
      control on all-cause mortality from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in 
      Diabetes study (ACCORD) in a second trial, the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial 
      (VADT). We then applied causal forests to VADT, ACCORD, and pooled data from both 
      studies and compared variable importance and subgroup effects across samples. 
      Results HTE in ACCORD did not replicate in similar subgroups in VADT, but variable 
      importance was correlated between VADT and ACCORD (Kendall's tau-b 0.75). Applying 
      causal forests to pooled individual-level data yielded seven subgroups with similar 
      HTE across both studies, ranging from risk difference of all-cause mortality of 
      -3.9% (95% CI -7.0, -0.8) to 4.7% (95% CI 1.8, 7.5). Conclusions Machine learning 
      detection of HTE subgroups from randomized trials may not generalize across study 
      samples even when variable importance is correlated. Pooling individual-level data 
      may overcome differences in study populations and/or differences in interventions 
      that limit HTE generalizability.

TI  - Cost-minimization analysis comparing eltrombopag vs romiplostim for adults with 
      chronic immune thrombocytopenia.
PG  - 1447-1456
LID - 10.18553/jmcp.2021.21080 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Promacta (eltrombopag; EPAG) and Nplate (romiplostim; ROMI) have not 
      been compared in head-to-head trials for treatment of chronic immune 
      thrombocytopenia (cITP); however, indirect treatment comparisons have indicated 
      similar efficacy and safety outcomes, and the drugs are generally accepted as 
      therapeutic alternatives. OBJECTIVE: To determine which of the 2 therapies would 
      result in the lowest overall cost from a US health plan perspective, under the 
      assumption of equivalent clinical efficacy and safety. METHODS: A cost-minimization 
      model was developed in Microsoft Excel. The model incorporated only costs that 
      differ between the treatments, including drug acquisition, administration, and 
      monitoring costs, over a 52-week horizon. Average dosing for EPAG and ROMI was taken 
      from the long-term EXTEND trial and from a published metaanalysis of 14 clinical 
      trials, respectively. ROMI is injectable and EPAG is oral, so only ROMI had 
      administration costs. The model assumed patients used 25 mg EPAG tablets and the 250 
      μg vial size of ROMI. ROMI wastage was included in drug acquisition costs by 
      rounding up average dose to the nearest whole vial. Monitoring requirements were 
      determined from US prescribing information, with platelet monitoring assumed equal, 
      and hepatic panel testing every 4 weeks for EPAG. The model was adjustable to 
      commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid plan perspectives, with optional inclusion of 
      drug wastage, monitoring, or administration costs. RESULTS: The base case used a 
      commercial plan perspective, with average dosing of 51.5 mg/day for EPAG and 4.20 
      μg/kg/week for ROMI. The analysis found a cost difference per treated patient of 
      $64,770 in favor of EPAG on an annual basis. Breakdown by unique costs for EPAG 
      included drug-acquisition cost of $123,135 and monitoring cost of $705. Breakdown by 
      unique costs for ROMI included drug-acquisition cost of $183,234, with wastage of 
      $63,179 and administration cost of $5,377. Based on a hypothetical commercial plan 
      with 1 million members and an estimated 11 patients with cITP receiving ROMI, 
      potential annual savings for switching all patients from ROMI to EPAG is $712,473 or 
      $0.06 per member per month. EPAG remained the less costly option for all plan types 
      and assumptions. A sensitivity analysis found that the result was most sensitive to 
      drug pricing and wastage inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Because of lower drug-acquisition 
      costs (including drug wastage) and administration costs, treatment of cITP with EPAG 
      is associated with a lower net cost per patient than ROMI. DISCLOSURES: This study

TI  - A population-adjusted indirect comparison of cardiovascular benefits of once-weekly 
      subcutaneous semaglutide and dulaglutide in the treatment of patients with type 2 
      diabetes, with or without established cardiovascular disease.
PG  - e00259
LID - 10.1002/edm2.259 [doi]
LID - e00259
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular (CV) effects of once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) 
      semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg are reported in their respective 
      placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), SUSTAIN 6 and REWIND. 
      There is no head-to-head CVOT comparing these treatments and heterogeneity between 
      their CVOTs renders conventional indirect comparison inappropriate. Therefore, a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to compare the effects of 
      s.c. semaglutide and dulaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in 
      patients with and without established cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: 
      Individual patient data from SUSTAIN 6 were matched with aggregate data from REWIND, 
      using a propensity score method to balance baseline effect-modifying patient 
      characteristics. Hazard ratios (HRs) for three-point (3P) MACE (CV death, non-fatal 
      myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke), anchored via placebo, were then indirectly 
      compared between balanced populations. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test 
      the robustness of the main analysis. RESULTS: After matching, included effect 
      modifiers were balanced. In the main analysis, s.c. semaglutide was associated with 
      a statistically significant 35% reduction in 3P MACE versus placebo (HR, 0.65 [95% 
      confidence interval [CI]; 0.48, 0.87]) and nonsignificantly greater reduction (26%) 
      versus dulaglutide (HR, 0.74 [95% CI; 0.54, 1.01]). Results were supported by all 
      sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a statistically 
      significant lower risk of 3P MACE for s.c. semaglutide versus placebo, in a 
      population with lower prevalence of pre-existing CVD than that in the pre-specified 
      primary analysis in SUSTAIN 6. Reduction in 3P MACE with s.c. semaglutide was 
      greater than with dulaglutide, although not statistically significant.

      Cancer: A Meta-Analysis and Indirect Treatment Comparison.
PG  - 693542

LID - 693542
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) comprises 15% of invasive breast 
      cancers. Platinum-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have 
      been extensively researched in recent years as promising treatments in the 
      neoadjuvant setting. However, clinical data is lacking in direct comparisons of 
      these two treating regimens. METHODS: We conducted an online search on PubMed, 
      Embase, Cochrane Online Library and key oncological meetings for available 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating ICIs or platinum drugs versus 
      anthracyclines and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AT-based NACT). 
      Conventional meta-analyses were conducted separately, and then indirect comparisons 
      for clinical efficacy and safety profile were performed between ICIs and platinum 
      drugs using AT-based NACT as a common comparator. RESULTS: Seven random controlled 
      trials (RCTs) with 1,647 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The indirect 
      comparison demonstrated that ICIs plus chemotherapy significantly improved 
      pathological complete response (pCR) rate (p = 0.00445, OR, 1.78; 95%CI, 0.70-4.53), 
      and decreased the adverse effect (AE) related discontinuance versus platinum-based 
      chemotherapy (P = 0.00015; OR 0.46; 95%CI, 0.26-0.82). CONCLUSION: ICIs plus 
      chemotherapy showed increased pCR rate and decreased adverse effects compared with 
      platinum-based chemotherapy in early TNBC. However, subgroup analysis and survival 
      data to explore the proper patients for each treatment remains scarce. Therefore, 
      further studies with powered direct comparisons of these two treating regimens are 
      required.

AB  - PURPOSE: Although cannabidiol and fenfluramine have been recently approved by the US 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for seizures in children with Dravet syndrome 
      (DS), the comparative efficacy and safety of these and stiripentol as an add-on 
      therapy for DS has not been evaluated in head-to-head trials. The current study 
      aimed to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of add-on anti-seizure 
      medications in DS. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE database search and a manual search 
      was done using keywords; "antiepileptic", "Dravet syndrome" and "antiseizure". The 
      primary efficacy outcome was ≥50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency from 
      baseline while the safety outcome was treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). 
      Frequentist approach were used for combining direct and indirect evidence and 
      network plots prepared. The drugs were ranked based on p-scores obtained using the 
      surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA). Heterogeneity across studies was 
      calculated by I(2) statistic and Q test. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) with 565 patients with DS (2-20 years) who received placebo or any of the 
      three active interventions (stiripentol, cannabidiol, and fenfluramine) were 
      included. Compared with placebo, all the three drugs were associated with a 
      significant reduction in convulsive seizure frequency from baseline. Stiripentol had 
      the highest probability ranking for ≥50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency 
      from baseline [OR: 20.2; 95% CI: 2.1-198.0] and for occurrence of any treatment 
      emergent adverse events (TEAEs) [OR:53.9; 95% CI: 1.4 to 2079.8] followed by 
      fenfluramine and cannabidiol. However, for serious TEAEs, the ranking order was 
      stiripentol followed by cannabidiol and fenfluramine. The trial on stiripentol had 
      limited sample size explaining the wide confidence intervals for the comparative 
      outcomes. CONCLUSION: In this indirect comparison, fenfluramine and stiripentol hadd 
      comparable efficacy but fenfluramine appeareded to be safer in terms of less 
      frequent serious TEAEs. Cannabidiol had relatively lower efficacy and was associated 
      with serious TEAEs. A head-to-head trial between stiripentol, cannabidiol and 
      fenfluramine is the need of the hour.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparison of efficacy outcomes for ciltacabtagene 
      autoleucel in CARTITUDE-1 versus idecabtagene vicleucel in KarMMa for the treatment 
      of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
PG  - 1779-1788
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2021.1953456 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study estimated the comparative efficacy of ciltacabtagene 
      autoleucel (cilta-cel) versus the approved idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) dose 
      range of 300-460 × 10(6) CAR-positive T-cells for the treatment of patients with 
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who were previously treated with a 
      proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody 
      (i.e. triple-class exposed) using matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons 
      (MAICs). METHODS: MAICs were performed with individual patient data for cilta-cel 
      (CARTITUDE-1; NCT03548207) and published summary-level data for ide-cel (KarMMa; 
      NCT03361748). Treated patients from CARTITUDE-1 who satisfied the eligibility 
      criteria for KarMMa were included in the analyses. The MAIC adjusted for unbalanced 
      baseline covariates of prognostic significance identified in the literature and by 
      clinical expertise. Comparative efficacy was estimated for overall response rate 
      (ORR), complete response or better (≥CR) rate, duration of response (DoR), 
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Cilta-cel was 
      associated with statistically significantly improved ORR (odds ratio [OR]: 94.93 
      [95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.86, 412.25; p < .0001]; relative risk [RR]: 1.34), 
      ≥CR rate (OR: 5.49 [95% CI: 2.47, 12.21; p < .0001]; RR: 2.21), DoR (hazard ratio 
      [HR]: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.29, 0.87; p = .0137]), and PFS (HR: 0.37 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.62; 
      p = .0002]) when compared with ide-cel. For OS, the results were in favor of 
      cilta-cel and clinically meaningful but with a CI overlapping one (HR: 0.55 [95% CI: 
      0.29, 1.05; p = .0702]). CONCLUSIONS: These analyses demonstrate improved efficacy 
      with cilta-cel versus ide-cel for all outcomes, highlighting its therapeutic 
      potential in patients with triple-class exposed RRMM.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of Bosutinib for the Treatment of Adult Patients with Chronic 
      Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in the Second-Line Setting.
PG  - 929-940
LID - 10.1007/s40258-021-00666-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recently conducted matching-adjusted indirect comparison demonstrated 
      that bosutinib improved progression-free survival, and delayed progression to 
      advanced disease compared with dasatinib and nilotinib in patients with second line 
      (2L) chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML). However, the long-term 
      clinical and economic impact of using bosutinib versus dasatinib and nilotinib has 
      not been evaluated. The objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
      bosutinib compared with dasatinib and bosutinib compared with nilotinib from a US 
      payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using partition 
      survival methods and three health states: progression-free, progression, and death. 
      Trial data (individual patient-level and aggregate-level data) informed the 
      progression-free and overall survival estimates. Costs included drugs and medical 
      resource use. Utility values were obtained from literature. Sensitivity analyses 
      (SAs) included one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs). RESULTS: 
      Comparing bosutinib versus dasatinib resulted in a gain of 0.4 discounted life 
      years, 1.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental costs of $28,459 
      (values in 2020 US dollars), for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
      $19,811/QALY gained. Comparing bosutinib versus nilotinib resulted in a gain of 0.8 
      discounted life-years, 1.8 QALYs, and incremental costs of $76,563, for an ICER of 
      $41,932/QALY gained. Drug costs and extrapolation distribution type were the main 
      drivers of the model in the one-way SAs. In the PSAs, bosutinib had >90% and >80% 
      probabilities of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
      $100,000/QALY versus dasatinib and nilotinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that compared with dasatinib and nilotinib, bosutinib may represent good 
      value for money for treating 2L CP-CML patients.

TI  - Effectiveness of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation Using Ablation Index Versus Second 
      Generation Cryoballoon in the Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: A 
      Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison.
PG  - 4388-4402
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01846-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Both radiofrequency (RF) and cryoballoon (CB) ablation are treatment 
      options for persistent atrial fibrillation (PsAF). An important recent innovation in 
      RF ablation is Ablation Index (AI), known also as the VISITAG SURPOINT™ Module, a 
      composite lesion quality marker whose use has been shown to significantly reduce the 
      incidence of acute and late pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection and the recurrence of 
      atrial arrhythmias in PsAF. Due to a lack of direct comparative evidence between the 
      latest generations of technologies, there is uncertainty regarding the best 
      treatment option in PsAF. The objective of the present study was to conduct a 
      matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) using individual 
      patient-level data (IPD) to assess the comparative effectiveness of the THERMOCOOL 
      SMARTTOUCH™ Catheter or the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH™ SF Catheter with AI/VISITAG 
      SURPOINT™ Module (STAI) versus the second-generation CB catheter (Arctic Front 
      Advance™; herein referred to as CB) with respect to 12-month atrial arrhythmia 
      recurrence, fluoroscopy time, and procedural efficiency. METHODS: IPD for STAI were 
      obtained from four investigator-initiated studies and were pooled. Comparable CB 
      studies identified from a systematic literature review were also pooled. In the 
      absence of a common treatment arm between STAI and CB studies, an unanchored MAIC 
      was conducted. The primary analysis compared the pooled STAI IPD to the pooled CB 
      cohort, with corrections for differences across trials, including eligibility 
      criteria and patient baseline characteristics. Scenario and sensitivity analyses 
      were conducted to assess the robustness of the primary analysis. RESULTS: In the 
      primary analysis, which was adjusted for left atrial diameter (LAD), age, diabetes, 
      and sex, STAI was associated with a statistically significant 65% relative reduction 
      in the rate of arrhythmia recurrence compared to CB at 12-month follow-up (HR 0.35; 
      95% CI 0.23, 0.52). STAI was associated with shorter total fluoroscopy time than CB 
      but longer procedure time. Results were consistent across scenario and sensitivity 
      analyses. CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency ablation with AI significantly reduced atrial 
      arrhythmia recurrence at 12-month follow-up and fluoroscopy time compared to CB, 
      with longer procedure times.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of onasemnogene abeparvovec and 
      nusinersen for the treatment of symptomatic patients with spinal muscular atrophy 
      type 1.
PG  - 1719-1730
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2021.1947216 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Onasemnogene abeparvovec, a one-time intravenous gene replacement 
      therapy, and nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide that requires ongoing 
      intrathecal administration, have been evaluated as treatments for spinal muscular 
      atrophy (SMA) type 1 in separate Phase III trials, but no head-to-head comparison 
      studies have been conducted. Onasemnogene abeparvovec was compared with nusinersen 
      using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to estimate the treatment 
      effect of onasemnogene abeparvovec relative to nusinersen for the treatment of 
      symptomatic patients with SMA type 1 for up to 24 months of follow-up. METHODS: In 
      the absence of studies for both onasemnogene abeparvovec and nusinersen with a 
      common comparator, a Bayesian naïve indirect treatment comparison (ITC) and MAIC 
      between onasemnogene abeparvovec and nusinersen were conducted to compare efficacy 
      and safety of onasemnogene abeparvovec with nusinersen. Outcomes of interest were 
      event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and motor milestone achievements 
      (independent sitting and independent walking). Relative treatment effects were 
      expressed as relative risk (RR) and risk difference. RESULTS: Pooled and weighted 
      patient-level data illustrated a favorable effect toward onasemnogene abeparvovec, 
      suggesting longer EFS for patients compared with nusinersen (HR of onasemnogene 
      abeparvovec vs. nusinersen: 0.19 [95% CI: 0.07-0.54; 99% CI: 0.05-0.74]). At 24 
      months of follow-up, patients receiving onasemnogene abeparvovec were statistically 
      significantly more likely to achieve the motor milestone of sitting independently 
      compared with patients treated with nusinersen. Although statistically significant 
      differences were not observed at 6 to 18 months between treatment options, the 
      likelihood of sitting independently at 12 and 18 months numerically favored 
      onasemnogene abeparvovec. A numerically greater likelihood of walking by 18 and 24 
      months was also observed for patients treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec compared 
      with nusinersen. Onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy was also associated with a 
      favorable (but statistically nonsignificant) outcome for OS and may be associated 
      with prolonged survival compared with nusinersen (HR of onasemnogene abeparvovec vs. 
      nusinersen: 0.35 [95% CI: 0.09-1.32; 99% CI: 0.06-2.01]). Bayesian naïve ITC results 
      were similar to the MAIC analysis for EFS, OS, and motor milestone achievements. 
      Small sample size limited covariate matching to baseline CHOP INTEND and nutritional 
      support requirement, leading to wider CIs and statistically inconclusive outcomes 
      for some of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations of the current MAIC 
      analysis (mainly a small sample size for statistical testing, even for the pooled 
      onasemnogene abeparvovec trials, and potential differences in prognostic and 
      predictive factors between studies), the relative treatment effects in EFS, OS, and 
      motor milestone achievement indicate that onasemnogene abeparvovec may offer 
      continued benefit compared with nusinersen through 24 months of follow-up.

AB  - Aim: Two poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors olaparib and talazoparib are 
      approved for patients with germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) HER2-negative metastatic 
      breast cancer. Methods: A Bayesian fixed-effects indirect treatment comparison (ITC) 
      analysis was performed to simulate the comparative efficacy (primary outcome of 
      progression-free survival [PFS]) and safety of PARP inhibitor monotherapy. Results: 
      ITC of data from the OlympiAD (olaparib) and EMBRACA (talazoparib) studies suggested 
      no significant difference in efficacy (PFS) between olaparib and talazoparib. 
      However, there were differences in specific adverse events; patients receiving 
      olaparib had a higher rate of nausea and vomiting, while those receiving talazoparib 
      had a higher rate of alopecia and anemia. Discussion: These data support the benefit 
      of the PARP inhibitor class in gBRCAm HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.

TI  - Methods for population adjustment with limited access to individual patient data: A 
      review and simulation study.
PG  - 750-775
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1511 [doi]
AB  - Population-adjusted indirect comparisons estimate treatment effects when access to 
      individual patient data is limited and there are cross-trial differences in effect 
      modifiers. Popular methods include matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) and 
      simulated treatment comparison (STC). There is limited formal evaluation of these 
      methods and whether they can be used to accurately compare treatments. Thus, we 
      undertake a comprehensive simulation study to compare standard unadjusted indirect 
      comparisons, MAIC and STC across 162 scenarios. This simulation study assumes that 
      the trials are investigating survival outcomes and measure continuous covariates, 
      with the log hazard ratio as the measure of effect. MAIC yields unbiased treatment 
      effect estimates under no failures of assumptions. The typical usage of STC produces 
      bias because it targets a conditional treatment effect where the target estimand 
      should be a marginal treatment effect. The incompatibility of estimates in the 
      indirect comparison leads to bias as the measure of effect is non-collapsible. 
      Standard indirect comparisons are systematically biased, particularly under stronger 
      covariate imbalance and interaction effects. Standard errors and coverage rates are 
      often valid in MAIC but the robust sandwich variance estimator underestimates 
      variability where effective sample sizes are small. Interval estimates for the 
      standard indirect comparison are too narrow and STC suffers from bias-induced 
      undercoverage. MAIC provides the most accurate estimates and, with lower degrees of 
      covariate overlap, its bias reduction outweighs the loss in precision under no 
      failures of assumptions. An important future objective is the development of an 
      alternative formulation to STC that targets a marginal treatment effect.

TI  - Economic Analysis of Leak Complications in Anastomoses Performed with Powered versus 
      Manual Circular Staplers in Left-Sided Colorectal Resections: A US-Based Cost 
      Analysis.
PG  - 531-540
LID - 10.2147/CEOR.S305296 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To estimate the cost impact of using the ECHELON CIRCULAR™ Powered Stapler 
      (ECP) compared with manual circular staplers (standard of care, SOC) among patients 
      undergoing colectomy procedures that involve left-sided anastomosis. METHODS: A US 
      hospital-based budget impact model was developed to estimate the impact of ECP in 
      reducing the surgical complication of anastomotic leak. The incremental acquisition 
      cost of ECP vs SOC was compared to the net potential savings from reduced 
      complication costs. The model was based on complication rates from a recently 
      published matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) that compared clinical and 
      healthcare utilization outcomes of patients using ECP with those of a propensity 
      score-matched retrospective SOC control cohort from a real-world clinical practice 
      population. The model assessed total cost, average length of stay (LOS), proportion 
      of patients with a non-home discharge, and all-cause readmission. Deterministic 
      (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to evaluate the 
      robustness of the model assumptions and inputs. RESULTS: Despite a higher device 
      cost of $412 for ECP compared with $298 for a manual stapler, annual savings due to 
      avoided complications with ECP was $53,987 for anastomotic leak, assuming 100 
      procedures per year with each type of circular stapler. ECP also helped to avoid 27 
      LOS days, 0.38 readmissions and 0.22 non-home discharges. Sensitivity analyses 
      around potential drivers of costs established the robustness of economic savings 
      with the use of ECP - with annual savings being most impacted by the probability of 
      anastomotic leak complication in the DSA. CONCLUSION: This model demonstrates that 
      among patients undergoing left-sided colectomy procedures, the incremental cost of 
      using the ECHELON CIRCULAR™ Powered Stapler instead of a manual circular stapler was 
      offset by the savings from lowered incidence and cost of management of anastomotic 
      leaks in the hospital setting.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of anti-IL-5 therapies of severe eosinophilic asthma in 
      Spain.
PG  - 874-882
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2021.1941065 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To analyse the cost-effectiveness of MEP with standard of care (SoC) versus 
      other anti-IL-5 therapies approved for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma 
      (SEA) patients, within the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective. 
      METHODS: A Markov model with a 4-week cycle length was used to compare MEP with BEN 
      and RES as therapies added to SoC in the management of SEA, in terms of cost per 
      QALY gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs (€2019) were 
      obtained from public sources, while utilities and transition probabilities were 
      retrieved from literature, e.g. network meta-analysis. Continuation criteria for 
      biological treatment and reduction of oral corticosteroids (OCS) was set at 50% 
      minimum reduction of exacerbation rate. Adverse events related to chronic OCS use 
      included diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts, acute myocardial infarct, and peptic 
      ulcer. The analysis was performed over a 5-year time horizon from the National 
      Healthcare System (NHCS) perspective, with a yearly discount rate of 3% applied to 
      both costs and QALYs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and univariate 
      deterministic sensitivity analysis were performed to address uncertainty around the 
      cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: On top of SoC, the model indicates that MEP is 
      dominant (lower cost, higher benefit) compared to BEN and RES: For BEN and RES, 
      respectively, treatment with MEP had a point estimate of 0.076 and 0.075 additional 
      QALYs, and savings of €3,173.47 and €7,772.95 per patient. The findings were robust 
      to variation as estimated using sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: MEP is a 
      cost-effective treatment in comparison with BEN and RES added to SoC for patients 
      with SEA in the Spanish setting.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and 
      pembrolizumab monotherapy in first line treatment of NSCLC in the US - updated 
      analyses with additional trial follow-up.
PG  - 792-805
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2021.1937188 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy substantially extends life expectancy for 
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Its cost-effectiveness (CE) 
      was previously evaluated based on interim trial analyses (follow-up ∼1 year). The 
      present analysis describes CE incorporating additional follow-up based on 
      protocol-specified final trial analyses (1-1.5 years additional follow-up), from a 
      US healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: A partitioned survival model is used to 
      compare pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs chemotherapy using data from the KN189 
      (non-squamous patients) and KN407 (squamous patients) clinical trials. An indirect 
      treatment comparison vs pembrolizumab monotherapy is made for patient subgroups with 
      PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and 1-49% based on data from the KN024 and KN042 trials. Efficacy, 
      treatment utilization, health utility, and safety data are derived from trials and 
      projected over 20 years. Costs for drugs, non-drug disease management, and adverse 
      events are also incorporated. RESULTS: Overall, versus chemotherapy alone, 
      pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is projected to increase life expectancy by 1.12 years 
      (3.35 vs 2.23) and 0.67 years (3.17 vs 2.50) in non-squamous and squamous patients, 
      respectively. Resultant ICERs ($158,030/QALY and $178,387/QALY) are below a US 
      3-times GDP per capita threshold ($195,000/QALY). ICERs vs chemotherapy also 
      generally fall below the threshold within PD-L1 sub-groups (except in squamous 
      PD-L1 < 1%, which may have differed due to small sample size) while ICERs vs 
      pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 ≥ 50% and 1-49% sub-groups generally exceed it 
      (except in squamous PD-L1 1-49%); largely a result of the higher drug acquisition 
      cost of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy relative to differences in life expectancy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, with longer-term trial follow-up and in the context of 
      prior literature, in the US, one of the two options for pembrolizumab use (either 
      pembrolizumab + chemotherapy or pembrolizumab monotherapy), represents a 
      cost-effective treatment in virtually all non-squamous and squamous metastatic NSCLC 
      patient populations and PD-L1 sub-groups evaluated.

TI  - Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Monoclonal Antibodies Versus Botulinum Neurotoxin a 
      in the Preventive Treatment of Chronic Migraine: An Adjusted Indirect Treatment 
      Comparison Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 671845
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.671845 [doi]
LID - 671845
AB  - Purpose: Calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies (CGRPmAbs) are new 
      agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for preventive treatment of 
      chronic migraine. Comparison between CGRPmAbs and previously approved Botulinum 
      neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) will inform optimal preventive treatment of chronic migraine, 
      but head-to-head trials are lacking. We therefore aimed to perform adjusted indirect 
      comparison between CGRPmAbs and BoNT-A through a meta-analysis. Methods: OVID 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, clinical 
      registries, and government websites were searched from inception to September 2019. 
      Randomized controlled trials comparing CGRPmAbs or BoNT-A with placebo in the 
      preventive treatment of chronic migraine were included. The primary outcomes were 
      headache days and migraine days measured at week 12. Data were synthesized by using 
      a frequentist approach; and the treatments were ranked by P-score. Results: We 
      included 10 trials (n = 4,678) after screening 1049 candidates. Six trials were with 
      low risk of bias. Fremanezumab had an effect similar to BoNT-A in the reduction of 
      headache days at week 12 (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.08, 95%CI -0.55 to -0.7). 
      Galcanezumab reduced more migraine days than BoNT-A at week 12 (SMD, -0.94, 95%CI 
      -1.24 to -0.63); fremanezumab showed similar findings (SMD, -0.55, 95%CI -0.85 to 
      -0.24). Galcanezumab and fremanezumab had better effect in mitigating headache 
      impact at week 12. CGRPmAbs and BoNT-A had similar adverse event rate. Conclusion: 
      CGRPmAbs and BoNT-A had similar effect in the preventive treatment of chronic 
      migraine. BoNT-A might be preferentially selected owing to its cost-effectiveness 
      profiles. Further studies with direct comparison of the two treatments are 
      warranted.

TI  - The Cost-Effectiveness of Lorlatinib Versus Chemotherapy as a Second- or Third-Line 
      Treatment in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-Positive Non-small-cell Lung Cancer in 
      Sweden.
PG  - 941-952
LID - 10.1007/s40273-021-01015-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lorlatinib is a third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)/c-ros 
      oncogene 1 (ROS1) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with efficacy in patients with 
      ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with a 
      second-generation ALK inhibitor or with first- and second-generation ALK inhibitors. 
      We examined the cost-effectiveness of second- or third-line+ (2L+ or 3L+) lorlatinib 
      in Sweden, versus chemotherapy. METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three 
      health states (progression free, progressed, or death) was used. Lorlatinib relative 
      efficacy versus chemotherapy was derived using unanchored matching adjusted indirect 
      treatment comparisons from a phase 2 clinical trial. Utility data were derived from 
      the same trial and published studies. Costs (year 2019) were obtained from Swedish 
      national data. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum using a societal 
      perspective (base case). Model robustness was evaluated with deterministic and 
      probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For 2L+, the average discounted total 
      quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain was 1.29 years. Total incremental costs were 
      Swedish krona (SEK) 731,791, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
      (ICER) of SEK 566,278 per QALY gained. Non-discounted survival gain amounted to 
      1.94 years. For 3L+, the average discounted total QALY gain was 1.25 years. Total 
      incremental costs were SEK 754,801, resulting in an ICER of SEK 603,934 per QALY 
      gained. Non-discounted survival gain was 1.88 years. Sensitivity analyses were 
      consistent. CONCLUSIONS: ICERs ranged from SEK 421,000 to SEK 384,066 less than the 
      boundary for a cost-effective treatment for a high-severity disease in Sweden (SEK 
      988,000), suggesting 2L+ or 3L+ lorlatinib is a cost-effective treatment for 
      ALK-positive NSCLC versus chemotherapy.

TI  - A method for assessing robustness of the results of a star-shaped network 
      meta-analysis under the unidentifiable consistency assumption.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/s12874-021-01290-1 [doi]
LID - 113
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a star-shaped network, pairwise comparisons link treatments with a 
      reference treatment (often placebo or standard care), but not with each other. Thus, 
      comparisons between non-reference treatments rely on indirect evidence, and are 
      based on the unidentifiable consistency assumption, limiting the reliability of the 
      results. We suggest a method of performing a sensitivity analysis through data 
      imputation to assess the robustness of results with an unknown degree of 
      inconsistency. METHODS: The method involves imputation of data for randomized 
      controlled trials comparing non-reference treatments, to produce a complete network. 
      The imputed data simulate a situation that would allow mixed treatment comparison, 
      with a statistically acceptable extent of inconsistency. By comparing the agreement 
      between the results obtained from the original star-shaped network meta-analysis and 
      the results after incorporating the imputed data, the robustness of the results of 
      the original star-shaped network meta-analysis can be quantified and assessed. To 
      illustrate this method, we applied it to two real datasets and some simulated 
      datasets. RESULTS: Applying the method to the star-shaped network formed by 
      discarding all comparisons between non-reference treatments from a real complete 
      network, 33% of the results from the analysis incorporating imputed data under 
      acceptable inconsistency indicated that the treatment ranking would be different 
      from the ranking obtained from the star-shaped network. Through a simulation study, 
      we demonstrated the sensitivity of the results after data imputation for a 
      star-shaped network with different levels of within- and between-study variability. 
      An extended usability of the method was also demonstrated by another example where 
      some head-to-head comparisons were incorporated. CONCLUSIONS: Our method will serve 
      as a practical technique to assess the reliability of results from a star-shaped 
      network meta-analysis under the unverifiable consistency assumption.

TI  - Sustained Complete Response after Biological Downstaging in Patients with 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma: XXL-Like Prioritization for Liver Transplantation or "Wait 
      and See" Strategy?
LID - 10.3390/cancers13102406 [doi]
LID - 2406
AB  - The XXL trial represents the first prospective validation of "biological 
      downstaging" in liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of 
      this study was to compare the Padua downstaging protocol to the XXL protocol in 
      terms of downstaging failure rates and patient outcome. A total of 191 patients 
      undergoing aggressive surgical downstaging and potentially eligible for LT from 2012 
      to 2018 at our center were retrospectively selected according to XXL trial criteria. 
      Unlike the XXL trial, patients with a complete response to downstaging did not 
      receive any prioritization for LT. Downstaging failure was defined as stable 
      progressive disease or post-treatment mortality. The statistical method of 
      "matching-adjusted indirect comparison" was used to match the study group to the XXL 
      population. Downstaging failure rate was considerably lower in the study group than 
      in the XXL trial (12% vs. 32%, d value = |0.683|). The survival curves of our LT 
      group (n = 68) overlapped with those of the LT-XXL group (p = 0.846). Survival 
      curves of non-LT candidates with a sustained complete response (n = 64) were similar 
      to those of transplanted patients (p = 0.281). Our study represents a validation of 
      the current Padua and Italian policies of denying rapid prioritization to patients 
      with complete response to downstaging. Such a policy seems to spare organs without 
      worsening patient outcome.

TI  - Equivalent Efficacy but Different Safety Profiles of Gemcitabine Plus Nab-Paclitaxel 
      and FOLFIRINOX in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/biom11060780 [doi]
LID - 780
AB  - FOLFIRINOX (FFX) and gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (GN) are the most common 
      chemotherapy regimens in first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer (PC). 
      They have not been compared each other in a prospective trial, but only in 
      retrospective studies, which can thus be affected by several biases. In order to 
      overcome these biases, we took advantage of matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      (MAIC), that allows an indirect comparison by reducing cross-trial differences, and 
      compared data from 268 patients treated with GN in a real-world setting with data 
      from the 171 patients included in the FFX arm of the PRODIGE trial. Survival 
      outcomes did not differ between the two populations. Overall survival was 11.1 
      months for both treatments (hazard ratio (HR) of FFX 1.10, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 0.81-1.49; p = 0.527). Progression-free survival was 6.0 months with GN and 6.4 
      months with FFX (HR of FFX 1.11, 95% CI 0.82-1.50; p = 0.520). On the other hand, we 
      observed a difference in the toxicity profiles: grade 3/4 anemia was more frequent 
      with GN, whereas a higher occurrence of grade 3/4 vomiting and diarrhea was reported 
      with FFX. FFX and GN show an equivalent efficacy but different safety profiles in 
      the first-line therapy of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Searching for reliable 
      predictive biomarkers is advised in order to improve therapeutic strategy in 
      metastatic PC.

TI  - Outcomes associated with the use of a new powered circular stapler for left-sided 
      colorectal reconstructions: a propensity score matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      with manual circular staplers.
PG  - 2541-2553
LID - 10.1007/s00464-021-08542-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This was a retrospective, matching-adjusted indirect comparison of 
      clinical outcomes between patients from a single-arm trial of the ECHELON CIRCULAR™ 
      Powered Stapler (ECP) and those from a historical cohort of patients who underwent 
      left-sided colorectal resection using conventional manual circular staplers, 
      extracted from the Premier Healthcare Database. METHODS: Patients in the ECP trial 
      cohort were propensity score matched to those in the historical cohort through 
      nearest neighbor matching. Outcomes included 30-day readmission rates; length of 
      stay (LOS) for the index admission; rates of anastomotic leak, pelvic abscess, 
      ileus/small bowel obstruction, infection, bleeding, and stoma creation. RESULTS: The 
      study included 168 patients in the ECP trial cohort and 4544 patients in the 
      historical cohort; 165 ECP trial patients were matched to 1348 historical cohort 
      patients. After matching, conversions were more prevalent in the historical cohort 
      than the ECP trial cohort (4.2% ECP vs. 10.2% historical, p = 0.001). Relative to 
      the historical cohort, the ECP trial cohort had statistically significant lower 
      rates of 30-day inpatient readmission (6.1% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.019), anastomotic leak 
      (1.8% vs. 6.9%, p < 0.001), ileus/small bowel obstruction (4.8% vs. 14.7%, 
      p < 0.001), infection (1.8% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.001), and bleeding (1.8% vs. 9.2%, 
      p < 0.001) during the index admission or within 30 days thereafter. No statistically 
      significant differences in rates of pelvic abscess, stoma creation, or LOS were 
      found between the two cohorts. Three sensitivity analyses to address the difference 
      in conversion rates yielded largely consistent results, with loss of statistical 
      significance for inpatient admission in some cases. This study is limited by its 
      potential for differences in unmeasurable factors between the ECP trial and 
      historical cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the ECP trial cohort had lower 
      incidence proportions of several surgical complications as compared with the 
      historical cohort. Further controlled prospective clinical studies are needed to 
      confirm the validity of this finding.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of Tisagenlecleucel in Paediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia 
      (pALL) and Adult Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) in Switzerland.
PG  - 3427-3443
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01767-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the present analysis was to explore the 
      cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel in relapsed or refractory (r/r) paediatric 
      acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (pALL) and r/r adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
      (DLBCL) in Switzerland against a range of historical standard-of-care treatments. 
      METHODS: Two cost-utility models were constructed for the two licensed indications 
      using similar methodologies but indication-specific data. Clinical efficacy data 
      were based on pooled analyses of clinical trials for tisagenlecleucel (pALL: ELIANA, 
      ENSIGN, B2101J; DLBCL: JULIET, NCT02030834) and published data for comparator 
      treatments. Treatment effects were compared based on matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison (MAIC) analyses. Four clinical lymphoma and leukaemia experts provided 
      Switzerland-specific input regarding comparators, diagnostic and therapeutic 
      procedures, clinical evidence and costs, which were used to inform the models. The 
      base case analysis reflected the perspective of the Swiss mandatory health insurance 
      system. Deterministic, probabilistic and scenario analyses were carried out to 
      explore the robustness of results. RESULTS: The base case analysis resulted in 
      incremental costs of CHF 31,961-CHF 36,419 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
      gained for pALL across the different comparators and CHF 113,179 for DLBCL (1 
      CHF = 1.09 USD). Incremental costs per life-year gained ranged between CHF 
      33,906-CHF 97,399 across the two indications. Including productivity gains, 
      tisagenlecleucel was shown to be dominant (more effective and less costly) over all 
      the comparators for pALL and to result in incremental costs per life-year gained of 
      CHF 57,324 for DLBCL. CONCLUSION: Using hypothetical willingness-to-pay thresholds 
      of CHF 100,000-150,000 per QALY gained, the present analysis has shown 
      tisagenlecleucel to be a cost-effective treatment option in pALL and DLBCL.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons of oral rimegepant versus placebo, erenumab, 
      and galcanezumab examining monthly migraine days and health-related quality of life 
      in the treatment of migraine.
PG  - 906-915
LID - 10.1111/head.14128 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rimegepant is an orally administered small-molecule calcitonin 
      gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, with demonstrated efficacy in the 
      acute treatment of migraine. Recent estimates from a single-arm trial (BHV3000-201) 
      have also shown evidence of long-term preventive effects in monthly migraine days 
      (MMDs) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aimed to compare MMDs 
      and HRQoL data for oral rimegepant to those obtained in placebo-controlled trials 
      for injectable anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) galcanezumab and erenumab. 
      METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) were conducted using 
      rimegepant subject-level data and published aggregate-level results from mAb trials. 
      Rimegepant baseline characteristics were matched to the pooled subject 
      characteristics from EVOLVE-I/II (galcanezumab vs. placebo; n = 1773) and STRIVE 
      (ereumab vs. placebo; n = 955) by reweighting the rimegepant subjects to more 
      closely match the distributions observed in these trials. To align with inclusion 
      criteria of the mAb trials, only the subset of rimegepant subjects with a history of 
      4-14 MMDs were included (n = 257). Weighted mean differences were used to calculate 
      adjusted change in MMDs, Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS) score, and 
      Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire version 2 (MSQv2) scores from 
      baseline to week 12. RESULTS: When matched to the EVOLVE trials, rimegepant was 
      superior to placebo with a mean difference in MMD change from baseline [95% 
      confidence interval] of -1.16 [-1.80, -0.52] and was not statistically significantly 
      different from galcanezumab 0.59 [-0.13, 1.32]. When matched to the STRIVE trial, 
      rimegepant was superior to placebo -1.59 [-2.15, -1.03] and was not statistically 
      significantly different from erenumab -0.06 [-0.61, 0.50]. Rimegepant showed 
      superior MIDAS and MSQv2 results compared with placebo in both EVOLVE trials and in 
      the STRIVE trial, no statistically significant differences from galcanezumab and 
      erenumab regarding MIDAS, and favorable results compared with erenumab across all 
      MSQv2 domains, while being generally similar to galcanezumab across all MSQv2 
      domains. CONCLUSIONS: When adjustments were made to reflect baseline characteristics 
      in published literature, supporting data from BHV3000-201 suggest that rimegepant 
      every other day is an effective therapy in reducing disability and MMDs and 
      enhancing migraine-specific HRQoL. These data support the preventive benefit 
      observed in randomized trials of rimegepant and further validate its efficacy for 
      both acute and preventive treatment of migraine.

TI  - Transporting experimental results with entropy balancing.
PG  - 4310-4326
LID - 10.1002/sim.9031 [doi]
AB  - We show how entropy balancing can be used for transporting experimental treatment 
      effects from a trial population onto a target population. This method is doubly 
      robust in the sense that if either the outcome model or the probability of trial 
      participation is correctly specified, then the estimate of the target population 
      average treatment effect is consistent. Furthermore, we only require the sample 
      moments of the effect modifiers drawn from the target population to consistently 
      estimate the target population average treatment effect. We compared the 
      finite-sample performance of entropy balancing with several alternative methods for 
      transporting treatment effects between populations. Entropy balancing techniques are 
      efficient and robust to violations of model misspecification. We also examine the 
      results of our proposed method in an applied analysis of the Action to Control 
      Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Blood Pressure trial transported to a sample of US 
      adults with diabetes taken from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
      cohort.

TI  - Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Monoclonal Antibody Versus Botulinum Toxin for the 
      Preventive Treatment of Chronic Migraine: Evidence From Indirect Treatment 
      Comparison.
PG  - 631204
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.631204 [doi]
LID - 631204
AB  - Background: The previously approved botulinum toxin and nowadays promising 
      calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody have shown efficacy for 
      preventing chronic migraine (CM). However, there is no direct evidence for their 
      relative effectiveness and safety. In this study, we conducted an indirect treatment 
      comparison to compare the efficacy and safety of CGRP monoclonal antibody with 
      botulinum toxin for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. Methods: Up to 
      August 31, 2020, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central). Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 
      relative risk (RR) were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. Indirect treatment 
      comparison (ITC) software was used to conduct indirect treatment comparison. 
      Results: Ten studies were pooled with 6,325 patients in our meta-analysis. Both 
      botulinum toxin and CGRP monoclonal antibody demonstrated favorable efficacy in the 
      change of migraine days, headache days, HIT-6 score, and 50% migraine responder rate 
      compared with placebo. In indirect treatment comparison, CGRP monoclonal antibody 
      was superior to botulinum toxin in the frequency of acute analgesics intake (WMD = 
      -1.31, 95% CI: -3.394 to 0.774, p = 0.02113), the rate of treatment-related adverse 
      events (AEs) (RR = 0.664, 95% CI: 0.469 to 0.939, p = 0.04047), and the rate of 
      treatment-related serious adverse events (RR = 0.505, 95% CI: 0.005 to 46.98, p < 
      0.001). Conclusion: For chronic migraine patients, CGRP monoclonal antibody was 
      slightly better than botulinum toxin in terms of efficacy and safety. In the future, 
      head-to-head trials would be better to evaluate the efficacy and safety between 
      different medications in the prevention of chronic migraine.

TI  - Primary and Secondary Prevention Strategies for Gastrointestinal Bleeding in 
      Patients with Left Ventricular Assist Device: A Systematic Review and Network 
      Meta-analysis.

AB  - Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common complication following left 
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Our study aimed to estimate the 
      comparative efficacy of different pharmacologic interventions for the prevention of 
      GIB, through a network meta-analysis (NMA). A total of 13 observational studies 
      comparing six strategies. Among those, 4 were for primary, and 9 were for secondary 
      prevention of GIB. On NMA, thalidomide (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.016, Credible interval 
      [CrI]I: 0.00053-0.12), omega-3-fatty acid (HR:0.088, CrI: 0.026-0.77), octreotide 
      (HR: 0.17, CrI: 0.0589-0.41) and danazol (HR:0.17, CrI: 0.059-0.41) reduced the risk 
      of GIB. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor 
      blocker (ACEi/ARB) and digoxin were not associated with any significant reduction. 
      Based on NMA, combining indirect treatment comparisons, thalidomide, danazol, and 
      octreotide treatments were associated with decreased risk of recurrent GIB. 
      Additionally, Omega 3 fatty acids were associated with a lower risk of the primary 
      episode of GIB in the LVAD patient population.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of ozanimod versus teriflunomide for 
      relapsing multiple sclerosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing number of immunomodulating disease-modifying therapies are 
      available for treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). In the absence of 
      randomized head-to-head trials, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) can 
      be used to adjust for cross-trial differences and evaluate the comparative efficacy 
      and safety of these agents. We used MAIC methodology to indirectly compare key 
      outcomes with ozanimod (OZM) and teriflunomide (TERI) in the treatment of RMS. 
      METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify clinical trials 
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of OZM vs TERI. Given the absence of head-to-head 
      trials of OZM vs TERI, we used a matching-adjusted indirect comparison to adjust for 
      potential treatment effect modifiers and prognostic factors while assessing 
      confirmed disability progression (CDP), relapse, and safety outcomes. Individual 
      patient data for OZM (SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B trials) and aggregate level data 
      for TERI (ASCLEPIOS I/II, TOWER, OPTIMUM, and TEMSO trials) were used to evaluate 
      the following outcomes: annualized relapse rate (ARR), proportion of patients 
      relapsed, CDP at 3 and 6 months, overall adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), 
      and discontinuations due to AEs. RESULTS: After matching, baseline patient 
      characteristics were balanced between OZM and TERI. Compared with TERI, OZM 
      demonstrated significant improvements in ARR (rate ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62-0.84), 
      proportion of patients relapsed (odds ratio [OR]: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.44-0.70), overall 
      AEs (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.29-0.43), SAEs (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.37-0.77), and 
      discontinuations due to AEs (OR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.09-0.21). OZM demonstrated 
      statistically significant improvements in CDP at 3 months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78; 
      95% CI: 0.66-0.92) but nonsignificant differences at 6 months (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 
      0.60-1.01) compared with TERI. CONCLUSION: In this indirect treatment comparison of 
      patients with RMS, OZM appeared to have an improved benefit-risk profile over TERI.

TI  - Indirect Treatment Comparison of Liso-Cel vs. Salvage Chemotherapy in Diffuse Large 
      B-Cell Lymphoma: TRANSCEND vs. SCHOLAR-1.
PG  - 3266-3280
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01756-0 [doi]
AB  - Most patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
      have exhausted their treatment options and are deemed palliative. CD19-directed 
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has recently been introduced as a new 
      option for these patients. Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) is an investigational 
      CAR T-cell therapy that has shown promising activity in this setting. We used an 
      unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) methodology to compare 
      liso-cel, using individual patient-level data from the TRANSCEND NHL 001 (TRANSCEND; 
      NCT02631044) trial, to salvage chemotherapy, using summary-level data from the 
      SCHOLAR-1 study, for the treatment of patients with R/R LBCL. Standardized mean 
      differences were used to evaluate imbalances between the TRANSCEND and SCHOLAR-1 
      studies. MAIC was conducted to determine the relative efficacy of liso-cel vs. 
      salvage chemotherapy with regard to overall survival, complete response rate, and 
      objective response rate. For all efficacy outcomes assessed, comparisons of clinical 
      factors before MAIC showed that five of seven baseline characteristics were similar 
      between the TRANSCEND and SCHOLAR-1 studies; however, age and R/R to last therapy 
      status differed between studies, thus requiring matching and adjusting to ensure the 
      validity of this analysis. The base case analyses demonstrated a significantly lower 
      risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4-0.6;

TI  - Association of Rotavirus Vaccines With Reduction in Rotavirus Gastroenteritis in 
      Children Younger Than 5 Years: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized 
      Clinical Trials and Observational Studies.
PG  - e210347

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Rotavirus vaccines have been introduced worldwide, and the clinical 
      association of different rotavirus vaccines with reduction in rotavirus 
      gastroenteritis (RVGE) after introduction are noteworthy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      comparative benefit, risk, and immunogenicity of different rotavirus vaccines by 
      synthesizing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies. DATA 
      SOURCES: Relevant studies published in 4 databases: Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane 
      Library, and Web of Science were searched until July 1, 2020, using search terms 
      including "rotavirus" and "vaccin*." STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials and 
      cohort and case-control studies involving more than 100 children younger than 5 
      years that reported the effectiveness, safety, or immunogenicity of rotavirus 
      vaccines were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A random-effects model was 
      used to calculate relative risks (RRs), odds ratios (ORs), risk differences, and 95% 
      CIs. Adjusted indirect treatment comparison was performed to assess the differences 
      in the protection of Rotarix and RotaTeq. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary 
      outcomes were RVGE, severe RVGE, and RVGE hospitalization. Safety-associated 
      outcomes involved serious adverse events, intussusception, and mortality. RESULTS: A 
      meta-analysis of 20 RCTs and 38 case-control studies revealed that Rotarix (RV1) 
      significantly reduced RVGE (RR, 0.316 [95% CI, 0.224-0.345]) and RVGE 
      hospitalization risk (OR, 0.347 [95% CI, 0.279-0.432]) among children fully 
      vaccinated; RotaTeq (RV5) had similar outcomes (RVGE: RR, 0.350 [95% CI, 
      0.275-0.445]; RVGE hospitalization risk: OR, 0.272 [95% CI, 0.197-0.376]). Rotavirus 
      vaccines also demonstrated higher protection against severe RVGE. Additionally, no 
      significant differences in the protection of RV1 and RV5 against rotavirus disease 
      were noted in adjusted indirect comparisons. Moderate associations were found 
      between reduced RVGE risk and Rotavac (RR, 0.664 [95% CI, 0.548-0.804]), Rotasiil 
      (RR, 0.705 [95% CI, 0.605-0.821]), and Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine (RR, 0.407 
      [95% CI, 0.332-0.499]). All rotavirus vaccines demonstrated no risk of serious 
      adverse events. A positive correlation was also found between immunogenicity and 
      vaccine protection (eg, association of RVGE with RV1: coefficient, -1.599; adjusted 
      R2, 99.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The high protection and low risk of serious 
      adverse events for rotavirus vaccines in children who were fully vaccinated 
      emphasized the importance of worldwide introduction of rotavirus vaccination. 
      Similar protection provided by Rotarix and RotaTeq relieves the pressure of vaccines 
      selection for health care authorities.

AB  - In this commentary, we highlight the importance of: (1) carefully considering and 
      clarifying whether a marginal or conditional treatment effect is of interest in a 
      population-adjusted indirect treatment comparison; and (2) developing distinct 
      methodologies for estimating the different measures of effect. The appropriateness 
      of each methodology depends on the preferred target of inference.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons of safety and efficacy of acalabrutinib 
      versus other targeted therapies in patients with treatment-naïve chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia.
PG  - 2342-2351

AB  - Acalabrutinib is a highly selective, potent, next-generation, covalent Bruton 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor with minimal off-target activity. Matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparisons (MAICs) were performed to estimate the safety and efficacy of 
      acalabrutinib compared to other targeted therapies for treatment-naïve patients with 
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Individual patient data for acalabrutinib 
      (ELEVATE-TN trial) were matched to aggregate baseline characteristics for 
      comparators. After matching, acalabrutinib (with or without obinutuzumab) showed 
      improved safety outcomes, except for increased risk of neutropenia (p < 0.001) for 
      acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab versus ibrutinib and increased risk of leukopenia 
      (p < 0.05) for acalabrutinib (with or without obinutuzumab) versus venetoclax plus 
      obinutuzumab. There was no statistically significant difference in progression-free 
      survival between acalabrutinib (with or without obinutuzumab) and any of the 
      comparators. This MAIC demonstrated a favorable safety profile for 
      acalabrutinib-based therapy compared with other targeted therapies in 
      treatment-naïve patients with CLL, without compromising efficacy.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or standard 
      of care in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.
LID - 10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001313 [doi]
LID - e001313
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, 
      is approved in the USA to reduce risk of cardiovascular (CV) death in adults with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established CV disease, based on EMPA-REG 
      OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes 
      Mellitus Patients) trial results. Empagliflozin reduced major adverse CV event 
      (MACE) by 14%, CV death by 38%, and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) by 35% 
      vs placebo, each on top of standard of care (SoC). SGLT-2 inhibitors canagliflozin 
      and dapagliflozin have also been compared with placebo, all on top of SoC, in CV 
      outcome trials. In the CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) 
      Program, canagliflozin reduced MACE by 14% and HHF by 33%. Dapagliflozin reduced HHF 
      by 27% in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial (Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of 
      Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events). This analysis estimated 
      the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or SoC, 
      in US adults with T2DM and established CV disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      Individual patient-level discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict 
      time-to-event for CV and renal outcomes, and specific adverse events over patients' 
      lifetimes. Occurrence of events in EMPA-REG OUTCOME was estimated based on 
      event-free survival curves with time-dependent covariates. An HR for canagliflozin 
      or dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on each clinical event was estimated from 
      published CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58, and EMPA-REG OUTCOME data using indirect 
      treatment comparison. Public sources provided US costs and utilities. RESULTS: The 
      model predicted longer survival for empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin, and SoC mainly due to direct reduction in CV death. Empagliflozin 
      dominated canagliflozin, yielding more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; 0.38) at 
      a lower cost (-US$306). Compared with dapagliflozin and SoC, empagliflozin yielded 
      0.50 and 0.84 incremental QALYs at US$1517 and US$27 539 incremental costs, yielding 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$3054/QALY and US$32 848/QALY, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin was projected to dominate canagliflozin and 
      be highly cost-effective compared with dapagliflozin and SoC using US healthcare 
      costs.

      with allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis (AR/C) with or without mild to 
      moderate asthma. METHODS: Systematic review methodology was based on the Cochrane 
      Collaboration handbook and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-analyses. Four databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science) 
      were queried from inception to July 30, 2020. Two independent reviewers screened 
      potentially relevant studies and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes of interest were 
      symptom score (SS), medication score (MS), combined symptom medication score (CSMS), 
      and Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Meta-analyses with an 
      adjusted indirect comparison were conducted in RevMan 5.4.1. RESULTS: Seven SCIT 
      versus SLIT randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated no significant 
      differences for any outcomes, but insufficient data precluded direct meta-analysis. 
      For the adjusted indirect comparison, 46 RCTs over 39 studies were included for SCIT 
      versus placebo (n = 13) and SLIT versus placebo (n = 33). Statistically significant 
      results favoring SCIT were found for SS (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.40; 
      95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31-0.49), MS (SMD = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.14-0.39), CSMS 
      (SMD = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.17-0.67), and RQLQ (MD = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.04-0.44). 
      Statistically significant results favoring SLIT were found for SS (SMD = 0.42; 95% 
      CI = 0.32-0.53), MS (SMD = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.28-0.53), CSMS (SMD = 0.37; 95% 
      CI = 0.29-0.45), and RQLQ (MD = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.20-0.43). No significant 
      differences were found between SCIT and SLIT for SS (SMD = -0.02; 95% CI = -0.15 to 
      0.11), MS (SMD = -0.14; 95% CI = -0.31 to 0.03), CSMS (SMD = 0.05; 95% CI = -0.21 to 
      0.31), or RQLQ (MD = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.31 to 0.15). CONCLUSION: SCIT and SLIT are 
      comparably effective treatments for adults with AR/C. More RCTs analyzing SCIT 
      versus SLIT are needed to directly compare the two. Laryngoscope, 132:499-508, 2022.

AB  - Idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell 
      therapy, has been investigated in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple 
      myeloma (RRMM) who have received an immunomodulatory drug, proteasome inhibitor, and 
      anti-CD38 antibody in the single-arm phase 2 KarMMa clinical trial. Two therapies 
      with distinct mechanisms of action - selinexor plus dexamethasone (Sd) and 
      belantamab mafodotin (BM) - are currently approved in the United States for heavily 
      pretreated patients, including those who are triple-class refractory. To compare 
      ide-cel versus Sd and ide-cel versus BM, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were 
      performed. Ide-cel extended progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
      (OS) versus both Sd and BM (hazard ratio (HR); 95% confidence interval (CI)). PFS: 
      ide-cel versus Sd, 0.46; 0.28-0.75; ide-cel versus BM, 0.45; 0.27-0.77. OS: ide-cel 
      versus Sd, 0.23; 0.13-0.42; ide-cel versus BM, 0.35; 0.14-0.87. These results 
      suggest ide-cel offers clinically meaningful improvements over currently approved 
      regimens for patients with heavily pretreated RRMM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our study sought to compare the 12-month clinical outcome of patients 
      treated with paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCB) vs. sirolimus-coated balloons (SCB) 
      during coronary angioplasty. BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons represent an 
      established therapeutic tool for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). A 
      comparison between PCB and SCB is still lacking. METHODS: We performed an indirect 
      comparison between two cohorts of patients previously included into two 
      investigator-driven registries with clinical primary endpoints, 494 treated with the 
      Elutax SV PCB (AR Baltic, Lithuania) from the DCB RISE registry, and 596 treated 
      with the Magic Touch SCB (Concept Medical, India) from the EASTBOURNE registry. The 
      primary endpoint was the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 
      12-month clinical follow-up. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, a total of 
      580 patients were well matched for baseline clinical and procedural characteristics 
      and were analyzed. At 12 months there was no significant difference between the 
      matched DCB RISE and EASTBOURNE cohorts in terms of the primary endpoint MACE (10.3% 
      DCB RISE vs. 10.7% EASTBOURNE, p = 0.892). No significant difference was observed 
      also regarding the rate of TLR (7.9% DCB RISE vs. 8.3% EASTBOURNE; p = 0.879, 
      respectively). By multivariate analysis, insulin-dependent diabetes was the only 
      predictor of MACE. CONCLUSIONS: In the SIRPAC study, the first indirect comparison 
      between paclitaxel-coated and sirolimus coated balloons, no significant difference 
      in clinical endpoints were found at 12-month follow-up. Randomized studies are 
      necessary to confirm these findings.

TI  - Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network 
      meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease for which some people have a 
      genetic predisposition. The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either 
      the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although 
      there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow 
      sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in 
      psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains 
      unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head, 
      which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the 
      efficacy and safety of non-biological systemic agents, small molecules, and 
      biologics for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network 
      meta-analysis, and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their 
      efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: For this living systematic review we updated 
      our searches of the following databases monthly to September 2020: the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched 
      two trials registers to the same date. We checked the reference lists of included 
      studies and relevant systematic reviews for further references to eligible RCTs. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic treatments in 
      adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic 
      arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed with moderate-to-severe 
      psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to placebo or another active 
      agent. The primary outcomes of this review were: the proportion of participants who 
      achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area and Severity 
      Index (PASI) 90 at induction phase (from 8 to 24 weeks after the randomisation), and 
      the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) at induction 
      phase. We did not evaluate differences in specific adverse events. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: Several groups of two review authors independently undertook study 
      selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised 
      the data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments 
      of interest and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the PASI 
      90 score) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse events). We assessed the 
      certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes and all 
      comparisons, according to CINeMA, as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We 
      contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. We used the surface under 
      the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to infer on treatment hierarchy: 0% (treatment 
      is the worst for effectiveness or safety) to 100% (treatment is the best for 
      effectiveness or safety). MAIN RESULTS: We included 158 studies (18 new studies for 
      the update) in our review (57,831 randomised participants, 67.2% men, mainly 
      recruited from hospitals). The overall average age was 45 years; the overall mean 
      PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were 
      placebo-controlled (58%), 30% were head-to-head studies, and 11% were multi-armed 
      studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. We have assessed a total of 20 
      treatments. In all, 133 trials were multicentric (two to 231 centres). All but two 
      of the outcomes included in this review were limited to the induction phase 
      (assessment from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation). We assessed many studies 
      (53/158) as being at high risk of bias; 25 were at an unclear risk, and 80 at low 
      risk. Most studies (123/158) declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 22 
      studies did not report their source of funding. Network meta-analysis at class level 
      showed that all of the interventions (non-biological systemic agents, small 
      molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo 
      in reaching PASI 90. At class level, in reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments 
      anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more 
      effective than the small molecules and the non-biological systemic agents. At drug 
      level, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, risankizumab and guselkumab 
      were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than ustekinumab and three 
      anti-TNF alpha agents: adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept. Ustekinumab and 
      adalimumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than etanercept; 
      ustekinumab was more effective than certolizumab, and the clinical effectiveness of 
      ustekinumab and adalimumab was similar. There was no significant difference between 
      tofacitinib or apremilast and three non-biological drugs: fumaric acid esters 
      (FAEs), ciclosporin and methotrexate. Network meta-analysis also showed that 
      infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab, and 
      brodalumab outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in reaching PASI 90. 
      The clinical effectiveness of these drugs was similar, except for ixekizumab which 
      had a better chance of reaching PASI 90 compared with secukinumab, guselkumab and 
      brodalumab. The clinical effectiveness of these seven drugs was: infliximab (versus 
      placebo): risk ratio (RR) 50.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.96 to 120.67, 
      SUCRA = 93.6; high-certainty evidence; ixekizumab (versus placebo): RR 32.48, 95% CI 
      27.13 to 38.87; SUCRA = 90.5; high-certainty evidence; risankizumab (versus 
      placebo): RR 28.76, 95% CI 23.96 to 34.54; SUCRA = 84.6; high-certainty evidence; 
      bimekizumab (versus placebo): RR 58.64, 95% CI 3.72 to 923.86; SUCRA = 81.4; 
      high-certainty evidence; secukinumab (versus placebo): RR 25.79, 95% CI 21.61 to 
      30.78; SUCRA = 76.2; high-certainty evidence; guselkumab (versus placebo): RR 25.52, 
      95% CI 21.25 to 30.64; SUCRA = 75; high-certainty evidence; and brodalumab (versus 
      placebo): RR 23.55, 95% CI 19.48 to 28.48; SUCRA = 68.4; moderate-certainty 
      evidence. Conservative interpretation is warranted for the results for bimekizumab 
      (as well as mirikizumab, tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, acitretin, ciclosporin, 
      fumaric acid esters, and methotrexate), as these drugs, in the NMA, have been 
      evaluated in few trials. We found no significant difference between any of the 
      interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAE analyses 
      were based on a very low number of events with low to moderate certainty for all the 
      comparisons. Thus, the results have to be viewed with caution and we cannot be sure 
      of the ranking. For other efficacy outcomes (PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment 
      (PGA) 0/1) the results were similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on 
      quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for several of the 
      interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows that compared to placebo, the 
      biologics infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab 
      and brodalumab were the most effective treatments for achieving PASI 90 in people 
      with moderate-to-severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate- to high-certainty 
      evidence. This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured 
      from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficient for evaluation of 
      longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of 
      studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 45 years) and 
      high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients 
      seen in daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that short-term trials 
      provide scanty and sometimes poorly-reported safety data and thus do not provide 
      useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. We found no 
      significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs, 
      and the evidence for all the interventions was of low to moderate quality. In order 
      to provide long-term information on the safety of the treatments included in this 
      review, it will also be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies and 
      postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies. In terms of future 
      research, randomised trials directly comparing active agents are necessary once 
      high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, including 
      head-to-head trials amongst and between non-biological systemic agents and small 
      molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23 
      versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also 
      undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve 
      participants, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). 
      Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and 
      researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the 
      interventions and the comparative safety of different agents. Editorial note: This 
      is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to 
      review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant 
      new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of 
      Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of subcutaneous (CT-P13) and intravenous infliximab in adult 
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a network meta-regression of individual patient 
      data from two randomised trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A subcutaneous (SC) formulation of infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 is 
      approved in Europe for the treatment of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
      (RA). It may offer improved efficacy versus intravenous (IV) infliximab 
      formulations. METHODS: A network meta-regression was conducted using individual 
      patient data from two randomised trials in patients with RA, which compared CT-P13 
      SC with CT-P13 IV, and CT-P13 IV with reference infliximab IV. In this analysis, 
      CT-P13 SC was compared with CT-P13 IV, reference infliximab IV and pooled data for 
      both reference infliximab IV and CT-P13 IV. Outcomes included changes from baseline 
      in 28-joint Disease Activity Score based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), 
      Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), 
      and rates of remission, low disease activity or clinically meaningful improvement in 
      functional disability per Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). 
      RESULTS: The two studies enrolled 949 patients with RA; pooled data for 840 and 751 
      patients were evaluable at weeks 30 and 54, respectively. For the CT-P13 SC versus 
      pooled IV treatment arm comparison, differences in changes from baseline in 
      DAS28-CRP (- 0.578; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.831, - 0.325; p < 0.0001), CDAI 
      (- 3.502; 95% CI - 5.715, - 1.289; p = 0.002) and SDAI (- 4.031; 95% CI - 6.385, 
      - 1.677; p = 0.0008) scores at 30 weeks were statistically significant in favour of 
      CT-P13 SC. From weeks 30 to 54, the magnitude of the differences increased and 
      remained statistically significant in favour of CT-P13 SC. Similar results were 
      observed for the comparison of CT-P13 SC with CT-P13 IV and with reference 
      infliximab IV. Statistically significant differences at week 30 favoured CT-P13 SC 
      over the pooled IV treatment arms for the proportions of patients achieving 
      EULAR-CRP good response, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 and ACR70 
      responses, DAS28-CRP-defined remission, low disease activity (DAS28-CRP, CDAI and 
      SDAI criteria) and clinically meaningful HAQ-DI improvement. CONCLUSIONS: CT-P13 SC 
      was associated with greater improvements in DAS28-CRP, CDAI and SDAI scores and 
      higher rates of clinical response, low disease activity and clinically meaningful 
      improvement in functional disability, compared with CT-P13 IV and reference 
      infliximab IV. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT, 2016-002125-11 , registered 1 July 2016;

TI  - Comparative Efficacy and Safety of Ozanimod and Dimethyl Fumarate for 
      Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Using Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison.
PG  - 795-804
LID - 10.1007/s40263-021-00805-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience relapses and sustained 
      disability progression. Since 2004, the number of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) 
      for MS has grown substantially. As a result, patients, healthcare providers, and 
      insurers are increasingly interested in comparative efficacy and safety evaluations 
      to distinguish between treatment options, but head-to-head studies between DMTs are 
      limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to compare efficacy and safety 
      outcomes with the DMTs ozanimod and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) using a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to adjust for cross-trial differences 
      in study design and population. METHODS: A systematic literature review was 
      performed to identify clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
      ozanimod compared with DMF. Individual patient-level data (IPD) for ozanimod were 
      obtained from the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B trials, and aggregate-level patient 
      data (APD) for DMF were obtained from CONFIRM and DEFINE. A MAIC is used to weight 
      IPD to APD based on important baseline patient characteristics considered to be 
      effect modifiers or prognostic factors in order to balance the covariate 
      distribution to establish more homogenous trial populations. Once trial populations 
      are determined to be sufficiently homogenous, outcomes of interest are estimated and 
      used to generate treatment effects between the weighted IPD and APD. We used MAIC 
      methodology to compare efficacy and safety outcomes of interest between ozanimod 1.0 
      mg once daily (OD) and DMF 240 mg twice daily (BID), including confirmed disability 
      progression (CDP) at 3 and 6 months, annualized relapse rate (ARR), proportion of 
      patients relapsed, overall adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and 
      discontinuations due to AEs. RESULTS: After matching patient data, baseline patient 
      characteristics were balanced between patients receiving ozanimod and those 
      receiving DMF. Compared with DMF, ozanimod demonstrated significantly improved CDP 
      at 3 months (hazard ratio 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.86), ARR (rate 
      ratio [RR] 0.80; 95% CI 0.67-0.97), proportion of patients relapsed (odds ratio [OR] 
      0.66; 95% CI 0.52-0.83), overall AEs (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.08-0.16), SAEs (OR 0.27; 95% 
      CI 0.19-0.39), and discontinuations (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.07-0.17). CDP at 6 months did 
      not differ significantly between the two agents (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.62-1.26). 
      CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment of baseline patient characteristics, the MAIC 
      demonstrated that the efficacy and safety of ozanimod 1.0 mg OD was superior to that 
      of DMF 240 mg BID. Although a MAIC is less likely to produce biased estimates than a 
      naïve or a standard indirect treatment comparison via a common comparator, 
      limitations include potential confounding due to unobserved and thus unaccounted for 
      baseline differences.

OAB - Ozanimod and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) are disease-modifying therapies used to treat 
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Comparative efficacy and safety 
      evaluation is important to key patients, healthcare providers, and health insurers; 
      however, head-to-head studies between MS therapies are limited. In this analysis, we 
      used an indirect treatment comparison method, specifically a matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison (MAIC), to compare results of clinical trials of ozanimod and 
      DMF. In this MAIC, findings suggested that ozanimod was associated with greater 
      reductions of relapses, a lowered risk of disability progression at 3 months, and 
      improved safety outcomes compared with DMF. Although MAICs were conducted while 
      adjusting for important treatment-effect modifiers and/or prognostic factors, the 
      possibility of confounding as a result of unobserved baseline differences remains. 
      Such an issue can be resolved only by conducting a head-to-head treatment comparison 
      in a randomized clinical trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Multiple immunotherapy and chemotherapy combinations are approved for 
      the management of advanced NSCLC which have not been directly compared in randomized 
      clinical trials. This study indirectly compared the effectiveness of 
      pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy+/-bevacizumab for 
      previously untreated non-squamous NSCLC patients without EGFR/ALK aberrations. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted 
      using individual patient data (IPD) from KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G (KN021 G) 
      (pembrolizumab + carboplatin + pemetrexed; N = 59) and KEYNOTE-189 (KN189) 
      (pembrolizumab + pemetrexed + platinum chemotherapy; N = 410) and published 
      aggregate data from IMpower 130 (atezolizumab + carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel; 
      N = 451) and IMpower 150 (atezolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab; 
      N = 356). To adjust for cross-trial differences in baseline characteristics, data 
      from patients randomized to pembrolizumab + chemotherapy in KN021 G/KN189 were 
      reweighted to match the baseline characteristics of patients randomized to 
      atezolizumab + chemotherapy from IMpower 130 or 
      atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab from IMpower 150. Outcomes included 
      overall survival (OS), blinded independent review-assessed progression-free survival 
      (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). OS and PFS follow-up were truncated to the 
      trial with shorter follow-up. Sensitivity analyses were conducted without truncation 
      of follow-up of OS and PFS. RESULTS: After matching for cross-trial differences, the 
      effective sample size of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy was 428 and 389 for the 
      IMpower 130 and IMpower 150 comparisons, respectively. The estimated HRs (95 % CIs) 
      of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy were 0.80 
      (0.67,0.95) and 0.79 (0.67,0.93) with regard to OS and PFS, respectively. For 
      pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab, the 
      estimated HR (95 % CIs) was 0.86 (0.72,1.03) for OS and 0.81 (0.68,0.96) for PFS. 
      For ORR, the estimated risk ratio (95 % CI) and the risk difference (95 % CI) was 
      0.9 (0.8,1.1) and -3.5 % (-10.0,3.1) for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus 
      atezolizumab + chemotherapy, respectively, and 0.8 (0.7,0.9) and -12.2 % 
      (-19.6,-4.8) for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus 
      atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab, respectively. Findings were consistent 
      across sensitivity analyses for both outcomes. CONCLUSION: MAIC results showed a 
      significantly better OS and PFS for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy compared with 
      atezolizumab + chemotherapy and a significantly better PFS for 
      pembrolizumab + chemotherapy compared with 
      atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab.

TI  - Comparison of Treatments for Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: 
      Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison and Network Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 191-202
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djab071 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), 3 drugs 
      under patent protection-apalutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide-were approved 
      based on randomized, placebo-controlled trials; 1 drug with generic availability, 
      abiraterone acetate, showed efficacy in a single-arm trial and is commonly 
      prescribed. Lacking head-to-head trials, the optimal treatment for nmCRPC is 
      unknown, despite widely varied treatment costs. We compared the efficacy and safety 
      of nmCRPC treatments. METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases, regulatory 
      documents, and trial registries for nmCRPC trials. We included published results 
      and, when available, original data. We performed matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison and network meta-analysis and compared treatments regarding 
      metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and serious adverse events. RESULTS: We 
      analyzed 5 trials with 4360 participants. Compared with placebo, abiraterone acetate 
      engendered the lowest hazard of metastasis and death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.22, 95% 
      credible interval [CrI] = 0.12-0.41), followed by apalutamide (HR = 0.28, 95% 
      CrI = 0.23-0.34), enzalutamide (HR = 0.30, 95% CrI = 0.25-0.36), and darolutamide 
      (HR = 0.41, 95% CrI = 0.34-0.49); darolutamide led to the lowest hazard of death 
      (HR = 0.69, 95% CrI = 0.53-0.90), followed by enzalutamide (HR = 0.73, 95% 
      CrI = 0.61-0.87) and apalutamide (HR = 0.75, 95% CrI = 0.59-0.95); darolutamide 
      resulted in the lowest odds of serious adverse events (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95% 
      CrI = 1.02-1.70), followed by enzalutamide (OR =1.43, 95% CrI = 1.08-1.89), 
      apalutamide (OR = 1.58, 95% CrI = 1.23-2.03), and abiraterone acetate (OR = 1.94, 
      95% CrI = 1.17-3.22). CONCLUSIONS: For nmCRPC, darolutamide offered optimal efficacy 
      and safety among approved drugs, and abiraterone acetate may offer comparable 
      metastasis-free survival benefit with cost savings from generic availability. Future 
      research is needed to more fully examine the benefit of abiraterone acetate.

TI  - Comparative Efficacy of Cabozantinib and Ramucirumab After Sorafenib for Patients 
      with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Alpha-fetoprotein ≥ 400 ng/mL: A Matching-Adjusted 
      Indirect Comparison.
PG  - 2472-2490
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01700-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cabozantinib and ramucirumab are approved for the treatment of adults 
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following prior sorafenib treatment; ramucirumab 
      is restricted to use in patients with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥ 400 ng/mL. 
      This matching-adjusted indirect comparison evaluated the efficacy and safety of both 
      drugs after sorafenib in patients with HCC and AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. METHODS: Individual 
      patient data (IPD) from the CELESTIAL trial (cabozantinib) and population-level data 
      from the REACH-2 trial (ramucirumab) were used. To align with REACH-2, the CELESTIAL 
      population was limited to patients who received first-line sorafenib only and had 
      baseline serum AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. The IPD from CELESTIAL were weighted to balance the 
      distribution of 11 effect-modifying baseline characteristics with those of REACH-2. 
      Overall survival (OS; primary endpoint) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 
      compared for the CELESTIAL (matching-adjusted) and REACH-2 populations using 
      weighted Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and parametric (OS, Weibull; PFS, log-logistic) 
      modeling. Rates of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and TRAE-related 
      discontinuations were also compared. RESULTS: After matching and weighting, baseline 
      characteristics were balanced between populations (REACH-2, N = 292; CELESTIAL, 
      effective sample size = 105). Weighted KM estimates for OS (median [95% CI]) were 
      not significantly different between cabozantinib and ramucirumab (10.6 [9.5-17.3] 
      months versus 8.7 [7.3-10.8] months; p = 0.104), but PFS was significantly longer 
      for cabozantinib than for ramucirumab (5.5 [4.6-7.4] months versus 2.8 [2.7-4.1] 
      months; p = 0.016). Parametric modeling results were consistent with the weighted KM 
      analysis. Rates of some grade 3 or 4 TRAEs were lower with ramucirumab than with 
      cabozantinib; however, TRAE-related discontinuation rates were similar (p = 0.271). 
      CONCLUSION: In this MAIC, cabozantinib significantly prolonged median PFS compared 
      with ramucirumab after prior sorafenib treatment in patients with HCC and 
      AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL; rates of some grade 3 or 4 TRAEs were lower with ramucirumab than 
      cabozantinib but related discontinuation rates were not significantly different 
      between treatments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials.gov identifiers: CELESTIAL

TI  - Indirect Comparison of Darolutamide versus Apalutamide and Enzalutamide for 
      Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.
PG  - 298-307
LID - 10.1097/JU.0000000000001767 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: No published head-to-head randomized trials have compared the safety and 
      efficacy of darolutamide vs apalutamide or enzalutamide in nonmetastatic 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. This study compares prespecified adverse 
      events and metastasis-free survival associated with darolutamide vs apalutamide, and 
      darolutamide vs enzalutamide, via matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Individual patient data from the phase III ARAMIS trial 
      (N(PLACEBO)=553; N(DAROLUTAMIDE)=943) were selected and reweighted to match the 
      inclusion criteria and baseline characteristics published for the phase III SPARTAN 
      (N(PLACEBO)=401; N(APALUTAMIDE)=806) and PROSPER (N(PLACEBO)=468; 
      N(ENZALUTAMIDE)=933) trials. Only baseline factors consistently reported across 
      trials were included as matching covariates. Both indirect comparisons matched on 
      age, prostate specific antigen level and doubling time, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
      Group performance status, Gleason score, and bone-sparing agent use. Darolutamide vs 
      apalutamide also matched on prior surgery and darolutamide vs enzalutamide also 
      matched on region. Risk differences and odds ratios were calculated for adverse 
      events and hazard ratios for metastasis-free survival. RESULTS: No differences in 
      metastasis-free survival hazard ratios were found after matching in either 
      comparison. However, fall, fracture and rash rates were statistically significantly 
      lower in favor of darolutamide vs apalutamide. Fall, dizziness, mental impairment, 
      fatigue and severe fatigue rates were statistically significantly lower in favor of 
      darolutamide vs enzalutamide. CONCLUSIONS: While metastasis-free survival did not 
      differ across drugs in these cross-trial indirect comparisons, darolutamide showed a 
      favorable safety and tolerability profile in prespecified adverse events vs 
      apalutamide and enzalutamide. Consideration of these adverse events is important in 
      clinical decision-making and treatment selection in nonmetastatic 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.

TI  - Cost Effectiveness and Budget Impact of Siponimod Compared to Interferon Beta-1a in 
      the Treatment of Adult Patients with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis with 
      Active Disease in Switzerland.
PG  - 563-577
LID - 10.1007/s40273-021-01023-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to evaluate the cost effectiveness and budget impact of 
      siponimod compared to interferon beta-1a for adult patients with secondary 
      progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease, from a Swiss health 
      insurance perspective. METHODS: We conducted an analysis using a Markov cohort model 
      with a cycle length of 1 year, life-long time horizon, and discount rate of 3% for 
      cost and health outcomes. We used a matching-adjusted indirect comparison to 
      estimate clinical outcomes using data from the EXPAND randomised controlled trial of 
      siponimod vs placebo and the Nordic SPMS randomised controlled trial of interferon 
      beta-1a vs placebo as the basis for estimates of disability progression and relapse 
      outcomes. We used 6-month confirmed disability progression results to estimate 
      disability progression in the base-case analysis. We calculated quality-adjusted 
      life-years (QALYs) based on an external study that administered the EQ-5D-3L 
      questionnaire to European patients with multiple sclerosis. We included costs (Swiss 
      Franc (CHF), year 2020) of drug acquisition/administration, adverse events and 
      disease management. We also performed a budget impact analysis to estimate the cost 
      over the first 3 years of introducing siponimod. RESULTS: For the base case, 
      siponimod resulted in mean incremental costs of CHF 84,901 (siponimod: CHF 567,838, 
      interferon beta-1a: CHF 482,937) and mean incremental QALYs of 1.591 (siponimod: 
      7.495, interferon beta-1a: 5.905), leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratio of CHF 53,364 per QALY gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the 
      probability of the cost effectiveness of siponimod assuming a willingness-to-pay 
      threshold of CHF 100,000 per QALY gained was 90%. Siponimod was projected to result 
      in drug administration costs for siponimod of CHF 23,817,856 in the first 3 years 
      after introduction, accompanied by large cost offsets in drug acquisition of other 
      multiple sclerosis drugs. Considering drug administration, monitoring and adverse 
      event management costs, it was estimated to result in additional healthcare costs in 
      Switzerland of CHF 2,177,021. CONCLUSIONS: In the base-case analysis, we found that 
      siponimod may be cost effective for treating Swiss adult patients with SPMS with 
      active disease. The results of the cost-effectiveness analyses are valid under the 
      assumption that the efficacy of siponimod and the comparators on disability 
      progression for the overall SPMS population would be the same in the active SPMS 
      population. CLINICAL TRIAL IDENTIFIER: NCT01665144. This economic evaluation was 
      based on the EXPAND trial.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Tisagenlecleucel for the Treatment of Pediatric and 
      Young Adult Patients with Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
      in Japan.
PG  - 241.e1-241.e11

AB  - Until recently, treatment options were relatively limited for children and young 
      adults with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 
      Tisagenlecleucel is a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy with 
      promising efficacy and manageable safety that was approved in Japan in 2019 for the 
      treatment of CD19-positive r/r B cell ALL (B-ALL). However, there is no publication 
      assessing the cost-effectiveness of CAR-T in Japan. The objective of this study was 
      to assess the cost-effectiveness of a tisagenlecleucel treatment strategy compared 
      to a blinatumomab treatment strategy and a clofarabine combination treatment 
      strategy (i.e., clofarabine + cyclophosphamide + etoposide) in Japan for pediatric 
      and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with r/r B-ALL. A partitioned 
      survival model with a lifetime horizon and monthly cycle was constructed from a 
      Japanese public healthcare payer's perspective. Patients were distributed across the 
      following partitioned health states: event-free survival (EFS), progressive disease, 
      and death, which were informed by the EFS and overall survival (OS) data of 
      respective clinical trials before year 5. For the tisagenlecleucel arm, a 
      decision-tree structure was used to partition patients based on the infusion status; 
      those who discontinued prior to receiving infusion were assigned efficacy and cost 
      inputs of blinatumomab and those who received infusion were assigned efficacy and 
      costs inputs based on tisagenlecleucel-infused patients. As trial data for 
      blinatumomab and clofarabine ended before year 5, matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparisons were used to extrapolate OS between the end of trial observation and up 
      to year 5. All surviving patients followed the mortality risk of long-term ALL 
      survivors without additional risk of disease relapse after year 5, regardless of 
      initial treatment strategies. The model accounted for pretreatment costs, treatment 
      costs, adverse event costs, follow-up costs, subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic 
      stem cell transplantation costs, and terminal care costs. Incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per life-years (LYs) gained and ICERs per 
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were evaluated using a 2% discount rate, 
      and a threshold of ¥7.5 million was used to assess cost-effectiveness. Deterministic 
      and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The total LYs (discounted) 
      for tisagenlecleucel, blinatumomab, and clofarabine combination treatment strategies 
      were 13.3, 4.0, and 2.7 years, respectively; the corresponding QALYs were 11.6, 3.1, 
      and 2.1 years, respectively. The ICERs per QALY gained for tisagenlecleucel were 
      ¥2,035,071 versus blinatumomab and ¥2,644,702 versus clofarabine combination 
      therapy. Extensive sensitivity analyses supported the findings. Tisagenlecleucel is 
      a cost-effective treatment strategy for pediatric and young adult patients with r/r 
      B-ALL from a Japanese public healthcare payer's perspective.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Remestemcel-L-rknd versus Ruxolitinib in Pediatric 
      Patients with Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease using Simulated 
      Treatment Comparisons.
PG  - 10-17
LID - 10.36469/jheor.2021.19008 [doi]
AB  - Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) can be a 
      lifesaving treatment for hematologic malignancies, but acute 
      graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) is a potentially deadly adverse effect experienced 
      by up to half of allo-HSCT recipients. Inadequate response to steroid therapy for 
      aGVHD is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality, including among 
      pediatric patients, who are the focus of this study. Ruxolitinib and 
      remestemcel-L-rknd were evaluated for the treatment of steroid-refractory (SR) aGVHD 
      in two separate single-arm trials. To effectively compare the safety and efficacy of 
      these treatments without a head-to-head trial, a simulated treatment comparison 
      (STC) was conducted. Methods: Regression techniques were used to adjust individual 
      patient-level data from the remestemcel-L-rknd trial to mutually reported baseline 
      characteristics from the ruxolitinib trial. Outcomes of interest included a 28-day 
      overall response rate (ORR), a 28-day ORR in the grade III-IV aGVHD population, and 
      adverse events (AEs). Results: In the full populations, the STC of risk ratios (RRs) 
      found treatment with remestemcel-L-rknd to be associated with a numerical but not 
      statistically significant improvement in the 28-day ORR versus ruxolitinib. In the 
      grade III-IV aGVHD sub-group, the STC showed significantly improved 28-day ORR for 
      remestemcel-L-rknd versus ruxolitinib (P=0.04). Remestemcel-L-rknd was also 
      associated with improved safety outcomes (P<0.05) in 17 out of 30 AEs, including 
      hematologic events, peripheral edema, muscular weakness, nausea, back pain, and 
      fatigue. Conclusion: Remestemcel-L-rknd was associated with significant improvements 
      in day 28 ORR compared with ruxolitinib in patients with severe (grade III-IV) SR 
      aGVHD. Across all grades of SR aGVHD, remestemcel-L-rknd was associated with fewer 
      all-grade treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (27/30) available for 
      comparison, including the majority reaching statistical significance.

TI  - SGLT2i versus ARNI in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 2210-2219
LID - 10.1002/ehf2.13313 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to determine the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
      inhibitor (SGLT2i) in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), compare 
      the effect of SGLT2i with angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), and find 
      whether combination of SGLT2i and ARNI is better than monotherapy. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials were 
      searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating SGLT2i or ARNI in HFrEF. And a 
      total of six trials were included. SGLT2i was found to significantly reduce the risk 
      of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure by 27% [hazard ratio 
      (HR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.80], hospitalization for heart 
      failure by 31% (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62-0.77), cardiovascular death by 16% (HR 0.84, 
      95% CI 0.74-0.95), and all-cause death by 16% (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.94) in HFrEF 
      only with a statistically higher risk of genital infection (risk ratio (RR) 2.78, 
      95% CI 1.46-5.29). The reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for 
      heart failure was of similar magnitude in patients with or without diabetes mellitus 
      (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.80 vs. HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.87) using SGLT2i. Indirect 
      treatment comparison showed that SGLT2i and ARNI had similar effects on primary 
      outcome (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82-1.06). And combination of SGLT2i and ARNI achieved a 
      better prognosis performance (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.89) compared with ARNI 
      monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2i could safely reduce cardiovascular death or 
      hospitalization for heart failure in HFrEF regardless of diabetes mellitus status. 
      SGLT2i and ARNI demonstrate similar effects, while combination of SGLT2i and ARNI 
      results in a better cardiovascular protective effect.

TI  - Regorafenib versus cabozantinb as second-line treatment after sorafenib for 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      analysis.
PG  - 3665-3671
LID - 10.1007/s00432-021-03602-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, three published phase III trials highlighted the superiority 
      of investigational drugs compared to placebo, thus leading to their approval in the 
      second-line setting. We report here a MAIC of second-line MKI options for patients 
      with HCC previously treated with sorafenib using individual real-world data of 
      regorafenib and aggregate data of second-line cabozantinib from the CELESTIAL trial. 
      METHODS: Data from 278 patients who received regorafenib as second-line therapy 
      after sorafenib failure for unresectable HCC were used as IPD. Data inclusion were 
      adapted to those reported in the CELESTIAL trial in the subset of patients who 
      received sorafenib as the only prior therapy. Survival medians and rates were 
      obtained from Kaplan-Meier curves, and differences between regorafenib and 
      cabozantinib groups were explored through Cox regression adjusted for weights 
      originating from MAIC. RESULTS: The median OS of the weighted regorafenib group was 
      11.1 months (IQR: 5.6-16.4) and 11.3 (IQR: 6.7-22.4) for cabozantinib; HR 0.83 
      (95%CI 0.62-1.09). The median PFS of the weighted regorafenib group was 3.0 months 
      (IQR: 1.9-4.8) and 5.5 (IQR: 2.3-9.3) for cabozantinib; HR 0.50 (95%CI 0.41-0.62). 
      In the subgroup who received prior sorafenib for < 3 months, the median OS of the 
      regorafenib group was 6.5 months (IQR: 4.7-10.9) and 9.5 months (IQR: 5.9-18.2) for 
      cabozantinib; HR 0.68 (95%CI 0.39-1.16). In the subgroup receiving prior sorafenib 
      for 3 to < 6 months, the median OS of the regorafenib group was 8.0 months (IQR: 
      4.2-15.2) and 11.5 (IQR: 6.5-23.9) for cabozantinib; HR 0.66 (95%CI 0.42-1.02). In 
      the subgroup receiving prior sorafenib for ≥ 6 months, the median OS of the 
      regorafenib group was 13.4 (IQR: 8.1-46.5) and 12.3 (IQR: 6.6-22.9) for 
      cabozantinib; HR 0.89 (95%CI 0.52-1.51). CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed no 
      differences between regorafenib and cabozantinib in terms of OS. However, in earlier 
      progressors on prior sorafenib a larger benefit might be expected from cabozantinib 
      treatment.

TI  - An indirect comparison between bosutinib, nilotinib and dasatinib in first-line 
      chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 801-809
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2021.1896489 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bosutinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are approved for the treatment of 
      patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML). In 
      the absence of head-to-head comparisons between second-generation tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (TKIs), the objective of this study was to indirectly compare the 
      efficacy of bosutinib with nilotinib and dasatinib in first-line (1L) CP-CML. 
      METHODS: Cross-trial heterogeneity in terms of patient baseline characteristics and 
      imatinib dose escalation are difficult to adjust for in network meta-analyses and 
      anchored matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (MAICs). Therefore, an 
      unanchored MAIC was performed using patient level data from bosutinib (BFORE trial) 
      and published aggregated data from nilotinib (ENESTnd) and dasatinib (DASISION) 
      trials. After matching, cytogenetic and molecular responses, and disease 
      progression, after a minimum follow-up of 24 months were compared between nilotinib 
      versus bosutinb and dasatinib versus bosutinib. RESULTS: The comparison of nilotinib 
      versus bosutinib resulted in no statistically significant differences for MMR at and 
      by 24 months, MR4 by 24 months, MR4.5 at and by 24 months, CCyR by 24 months, and 
      disease progression, however, a decreased odds of MR4 at 24 months in favor of 
      bosutinib versus nilotinib was observed. The comparison of dasatinib versus 
      bosutinib by 24 months resulted in no statistically significant differences for MMR, 
      disease progression, and CCyR, however a decreased odds of MR4.5 in favor of 
      bosutinib versus dasatinib was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in these analyses 
      bosutinib demonstrates equivalent efficacy to nilotinib and dasatinib in the 
      treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML.

      cytarabine in acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 603-612
LID - 10.2217/cer-2020-0280 [doi]
AB  - Background: Two combination therapies recently approved and recommended for use in 
      combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) in acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit 
      for intensive chemotherapy are glasdegib+LDAC and venetoclax+LDAC. Materials & 
      methods: An indirect treatment comparison used median overall survival, overall 
      survival hazard ratios, complete remission (CR), CR+CR with incomplete blood count 
      recovery and transfusion independence to assess comparative effectiveness, and a 
      simulated treatment comparison accounted for differences in patient characteristics 
      between trials. Results: Differences in efficacy between glasdegib+LDAC and 
      venetoclax+LDAC were suggestive and not statistically significant. Conclusion: With 
      no significant differences in comparative effectiveness, considerations such as 
      safety profiles, burden of administration and patient preference are likely to guide 
      treatment decisions.

TI  - Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparisons in the assessment of hemato-oncological 
      drugs.
PG  - 55-60
LID - 10.7399/fh.11443 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison is a methodology that has been 
      developed to assess new treatments vs alternatives when a direct comparison is not 
      available through a randomized controlled trial. These comparisons are of particular 
      interest in the areas of oncology and hematology where uncertainty in 
      decision-making on the inclusion of new drugs is frequently accentuated by both the 
      severity of the disease and the high cost of treatment. The objective of this study 
      was to describe how Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison methodology has been used 
      to date in the assessment of hematological cancer drugs by international agencies. 
      METHOD: Between January 2015 and October 2019, an exhaustive search was conducted of 
      the websites of European National Agencies that provided public information on the 
      assessment process. The assessments provided by these agencies were reviewed to 
      obtain a list of hematological cancer drugs for which the presentation of a 
      Matched-Adjusted Indirect Comparison was recorded. For this list of drugs, the role 
      of the comparison in the assessment process was analyzed for each selected agency. 
      RESULTS: Thirteen hematological and oncological treatments were found in which the 
      pharmaceutical marketing authorization holder had presented Matching-Adjusted 
      Indirect Comparisons: most of this information referred to the first half of 2018. 
      Acceptance of this methodology diverges among agencies, ranging from 50% in the case 
      of the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, to 40% in the 
      case of French National Authority for Health, to not having been taken into account 
      in any of the 3 cases assessed by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency 
      in Health Care. The main cause of non-acceptance was matching-related problems. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Matching- Adjusted Indirect Comparison methodology is a tool that is

TI  - Cost effectiveness of axicabtagene ciloleucel versus tisagenlecleucel for adult 
      patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines 
      of systemic therapy in the United States.
PG  - 458-468
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2021.1901721 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To assess from a US payer perspective the cost-effectiveness of the chimeric 
      antigen receptor T (CAR T)-cell therapies axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and 
      tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) to treat relapsed or refractory (r/r) large B-cell 
      lymphoma (LBCL) following ≥2 systemic therapy lines. METHODS: A three-state (i.e. 
      pre-progression, post-progression, and death) partitioned survival model was used to 
      estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs for patients on each 
      treatment over a lifetime horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
      survival (OS) were based on a matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) 
      that accounted for differences in trial population baseline characteristics. Mixture 
      cure models (MCMs) were used to account for long-term survivors. Costs included drug 
      acquisition and administration for the CAR T-cell therapies and conditioning 
      chemotherapy, apheresis, CAR T-specific monitoring, transplant, hospitalization, 
      adverse events, routine care, and terminal care. Health state utilities were derived 
      from trial and published data. Sensitivity analyses included probabilistic 
      sensitivity analyses (PSAs) and an analysis of extremes that assessed the results 
      across a vast array of combinations of parametric OS and PFS curves across the two 
      therapies. RESULTS: Compared to tisa-cel, axi-cel resulted in 2.31 QALYs gained and 
      a cost reduction of $1,407 in the base case. In the PSA, the cost per QALY gained 
      was ≤$31,500 in 95% of the 1,000 simulations. In the analysis of extremes, the cost 
      per QALY gained was ≤$7,500 in 99% of the 1,296 combinations of MCMs and ≤$40,000 in 
      95% of the 1,296 combinations of standard models. LIMITATIONS: In absence of 
      head-to-head comparative data, we relied on a MAIC, which cannot account for all 
      possible confounders. Moreover, some outcomes (i.e. transplantations, 
      hospitalizations, adverse events (AEs)) were not adjusted in the MAIC. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In this simulation, axi-cel was a superior treatment option as it is predicted to 
      achieve better outcomes at lower or minimal incremental costs versus tisa-cel.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of Empagliflozin Compared with Dapagliflozin for the Treatment of 
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Established Cardiovascular Disease in 
      Greece.
PG  - 371-380
LID - 10.1007/s40261-021-01013-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for approximately 
      95% of all diabetes cases and is associated with a substantially elevated risk for 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) that is 2- to 4-times higher in patients with T2DM 
      compared to those without. The aim of present study was to evaluate the cost 
      effectiveness of empagliflozin compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment of 
      patients with T2DM and established CVD in Greece. METHODS: A published health 
      economic model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes of T2DM patients 
      receiving empagliflozin compared to those receiving dapagliflozin. Individual 
      patient-level discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict time-to-event for 
      CV, renal, and adverse events over patients' lifetimes. Hazard ratios for 
      dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on each clinical event was estimated from 
      DECLARE-TIMI 58 and EMPA-REG OUTCOME trials' data using an indirect treatment 
      comparison. Following a public payer perspective, only direct medical costs related 
      to drug acquisition, fatal/non-fatal diabetes-related complications and adverse 
      events were considered (€2020). Model extrapolated outcomes included life years 
      (LY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs as well as incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of changes 
      in input data. RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, empagliflozin was associated with 
      longer mean survival (17.23 LY with empagliflozin vs 16.07 LY with dapagliflozin) 
      and reduced rate of CV mortality resulting in 0.48 more QALYs (9.27 vs 8.79), at 
      additional costs of €462. The generated ICER of empagliflozin was €965 per QALY 
      gained. Deterministic sensitivity analysis confirmed empagliflozin's cost-effective 
      profile. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of 
      empagliflozin being cost effective over dapagliflozin was 100%, at the defined 
      threshold of €36,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin was estimated to be 
      a highly cost-effective treatment option compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment 
      of T2DM patients with established CVD in Greece.

TI  - A comparison of reweighting estimators of average treatment effects in real world 
      populations.
PG  - 765-782
LID - 10.1002/pst.2106 [doi]
AB  - Regulatory agencies typically evaluate the efficacy and safety of new interventions 
      and grant commercial approval based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Other 
      major healthcare stakeholders, such as insurance companies and health technology 
      assessment agencies, while basing initial access and reimbursement decisions on RCT 
      results, are also keenly interested in whether results observed in idealized trial 
      settings will translate into comparable outcomes in real world settings-that is, 
      into so-called "real world" effectiveness. Unfortunately, evidence of real world 
      effectiveness for new interventions is not available at the time of initial 
      approval. To bridge this gap, statistical methods are available to extend the 
      estimated treatment effect observed in a RCT to a target population. The 
      generalization is done by weighting the subjects who participated in a RCT so that 
      the weighted trial population resembles a target population. We evaluate a variety 
      of alternative estimation and weight construction procedures using both simulations 
      and a real world data example using two clinical trials of an investigational 
      intervention for Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest an optimal approach to 
      estimation depends on the characteristics of source and target populations, 
      including degree of selection bias and treatment effect heterogeneity.

TI  - Characterization of a Real-World Response Variable and Comparison with RECIST-Based 
      Response Rates from Clinical Trials in Advanced NSCLC.
PG  - 1843-1859
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01659-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Effectiveness metrics for real-word research, analogous to clinical 
      trial ones, are needed. This study aimed to develop a real-world response (rwR) 
      variable applicable to solid tumors and to evaluate its clinical relevance and 
      meaningfulness. METHODS: This retrospective study used patient cohorts with advanced 
      non-small cell lung cancer from a nationwide, de-identified electronic health record 
      (EHR)-derived database. Disease burden information abstracted manually was 
      classified into response categories anchored to discrete therapy lines (per 
      patient-line). In part 1, we quantified the feasibility and reliability of data 
      capture, and estimated the association between rwR status and real-world 
      progression-free survival (rwPFS) and real-world overall survival (rwOS). In part 2, 
      we investigated the correlation between published clinical trial overall response 
      rates (ORRs) and real-world response rates (rwRRs) from corresponding real-world 
      patient cohorts. RESULTS: In part 1, 85.4% of patients (N = 3248) had  at least one 
      radiographic assessment documented. Median abstraction time per patient-line was 
      15.0 min (IQR 7.8-28.1). Inter-abstractor agreement on presence/absence of at least 
      one assessment was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96; n = 503 patient-lines abstracted in 
      duplicate); inter-abstractor agreement on best confirmed response category was 0.82 
      (95% CI 0.78-0.86; n = 384 with at least one captured assessment). Confirmed 
      responders at a 3-month landmark showed significantly lower risk of death and 
      progression in rwOS and rwPFS analyses across all line settings. In part 2, rwRRs 
      (from 12 rw cohorts) showed a high correlation with trial ORRs (Spearman's 
      ρ = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a rwR variable generated from clinician 
      assessments documented in EHRs following radiographic evaluations. This variable 
      provides clinically meaningful information and may provide a real-world measure of 
      treatment effectiveness.

TI  - Efficacy of rFVIIIFc versus Emicizumab for the Treatment of Patients with Hemophilia 
      A without Inhibitors: Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of A-LONG and HAVEN 
      Trials.
PG  - 115-122
LID - 10.2147/JBM.S288283 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Primary prophylaxis, using factor VIII replacement, is the recognized 
      standard of care for severe hemophilia A. Recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion protein 
      (rFVIIIFc) and emicizumab, a humanized, bispecific antibody, are approved for 
      routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in severe hemophilia A. These products have 
      different mechanisms of action, methods of administration and treatment schedules. 
      In the absence of head-to-head trials, indirect treatment comparisons can provide 
      informative evidence on the relative efficacy of the two treatments. The aim of the 
      study was to compare the approved dosing regimens for each product, rFVIIIFc 
      individualized prophylaxis and emicizumab administered once every week (Q1W), every 
      2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W), based on clinical trial evidence. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: The comparison was conducted using matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      since clinical evidence did not form a connected network. Individual patient data 
      for rFVIIIFc (A-LONG) were compared with data for emicizumab (HAVEN trial program) 
      for mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and proportion of patients with zero bleeds. 
      Safety data reported across the analyzed treatment arms were tabularized but not 
      formally compared. RESULTS: After matching, no significant differences were observed 
      between mean ABR for rFVIIIFc and emicizumab administered Q1W, Q2W or Q4W. The 
      proportion of patients with zero bleeds was significantly higher with rFVIIIFc 
      compared with emicizumab administered Q4W (51.2% versus 29.3%, respectively; odds 
      ratio 2.53; 95% confidence interval 1.09-5.89); no significant differences noted 
      when rFVIIIFc was compared with emicizumab administered Q1W or Q2W. The mean number 
      of adverse events expressed per participant was 1.9 for individualized prophylaxis 
      with rFVIIIFc and 3.7-4.0, 4.1 and 3.6 for emicizumab administered Q1W, Q2W or Q4W, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: This indirect treatment comparison suggests that rFVIIIFc 
      individualized prophylaxis is more efficacious than emicizumab Q4W, and at least as 
      effective as more frequent emicizumab regimens, for the management of hemophilia A.

TI  - Indirect Comparison of Lanadelumab and Intravenous C1-INH Using Data from the HELP 
      and CHANGE Studies: Bayesian and Frequentist Analyses.
PG  - 113-121
LID - 10.1007/s40268-021-00337-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) 
      deficiency is a rare disease associated with painful, potentially fatal swelling 
      episodes affecting subcutaneous or submucosal tissues. HAE attacks recur with 
      unpredictable severity and frequency throughout patients' lives; long-term 
      prophylaxis is essential for some patients. In the absence of head-to-head studies, 
      indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of long-term prophylactic agents is a valid 
      approach to evaluate comparative efficacy. METHODS: We conducted an ITC using data 
      from the placebo-controlled HELP study (assessing patients receiving lanadelumab 300 
      mg every 2 or 4 weeks) and the 12-week, parallel arm, crossover CHANGE study 
      (assessing intravenous C1-INH). Outcomes of interest were attack rate ratio (ARR) 
      and time to attack after day 0 (TTA0) and after day 70 (TTA70). Two ITC 
      methodologies were used: a Bayesian approach using study results to update 
      non-informative prior distributions to posterior distributions on relative treatment 
      effects, and a frequentist approach using patient-level data from HELP and CHANGE to 
      generate Poisson regressions (for ARR) and Cox models (for TTA0 and TT70). RESULTS: 
      Both Bayesian and frequentist analyses suggested that lanadelumab reduced HAE attack 
      rate by 46-73% versus intravenous C1-INH. Relative to intravenous C1-INH, risk of 
      first attack after day 0 was comparable between intravenous C1-INH and both 
      lanadelumab doses; risk of first attack after day 70 was reduced by 81-83% with 
      lanadelumab 300 mg every 2 weeks, compared with C1-INH. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from 
      these two ITC methodologies support the favorable efficacy of lanadelumab in 
      reducing the HAE attack rate and extending attack-free intervals in patients with 
      HAE.

TI  - Network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of biologic treatments for achieving 
      complete resolution of nail psoriasis.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/09546634.2021.1892024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nail psoriasis (NP) is common and of high importance in patients with 
      psoriasis. Complete resolution of NP at week 24‒26 is an unambiguous nail outcome 
      accessible for indirect treatment comparison of biologics. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 
      the comparative efficacy of approved biologics in achieving complete resolution of 
      NP at week 24‒26. METHODS: A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to indirectly 
      compare the efficacy of six biologics in achieving complete resolution of NP at week 
      24‒26 in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and concomitant NP. Complete 
      resolution of NP was defined as a score of zero on the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index 
      (NAPSI), modified NAPSI (mNAPSI) or Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernails 
      (PGA-F). RESULTS: The probability of achieving complete resolution of NP was highest 
      for ixekizumab (46.5%; 95% credibility interval [CrI] 35.1‒58.0; Surface Under the 
      Cumulative RAnking curve [SUCRA] 97%), followed by brodalumab (37.0%; 17.0‒61.0; 
      79%), adalimumab (28.3%; 24.4‒32.4; 62%), guselkumab (27.7%; 21.1‒35.1; 58%), 
      ustekinumab (20.8%; 10.2‒35.2; 37%), and infliximab (0.8%; 0.0‒8.9; 17%). 
      CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and concomitant NP, 
      ixekizumab has the greatest likelihood among approved biologics of achieving 
      complete resolution of NP at week 24‒26. Findings should be interpreted carefully 
      because of inherent study limitations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zuranolone (SAGE-217) is a novel, investigational positive allosteric 
      modulator of GABA(A) receptors being investigated in major depressive disorder 
      (MDD). This analysis of phase 2 data quantified the benefit and risk of zuranolone 
      (30mg) versus placebo and antidepressants in terms of number needed to treat (NNT) 
      and number needed to harm (NNH). METHODS: Rates of response, remission, and 
      all-cause discontinuation for zuranolone and 11 antidepressant comparators were 
      obtained from the zuranolone phase 2 clinical study (N=89) and a published network 
      meta-analysis, respectively. An indirect treatment comparison was conducted using 
      the Bucher method to compare zuranolone to standard-of-care. RESULTS: Zuranolone 
      demonstrated greater benefit compared to placebo on Day 3 (NNT range for 
      response=4-5, NNT for remission=10) and at Day 15 (NNT=3 for response and 
      remission). Compared to SSRIs and SNRIs, zuranolone at Day 15 showed improved 
      treatment response (NNT=4 [95% CI = 3; 16] and 5 [95% CI = 3; 25], respectively) and 
      remission (NNT=4 [95% CI = 2; 13] and 4 [95% CI = 2; 18], respectively). This was 
      accompanied by a reduction in all-cause discontinuation, with negative NNH values 
      (-57 and -28), respectively. LIMITATIONS: Variations in study design across the 
      included trials may limit the generalizability of results. CONCLUSIONS: With a small 
      positive NNT as early as Day 3 indicating robust benefit and a negative NNH 
      indicating reduced harm, this analysis based on a phase 2 study suggests that 
      patients with MDD may benefit from the benefit-to-risk profile of zuranolone.

TI  - Is Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Superior 
      Even to Lenvatinib? A Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison.
PG  - 249-254
LID - 10.1007/s11523-021-00803-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab showed superior progression-free and 
      overall survival compared to sorafenib in the IMbrave150 trial. It would therefore 
      be useful to compare the efficacy of lenvatinib and that of atezolizumab plus 
      bevacizumab to determine if a benefit of one therapy against the other exists. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present report was to apply a matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison (MAIC) to individual participant data (IPD) from patients treated with 
      lenvatinib outside of randomized trials, to aggregate results derived from the 
      IMbrave150 trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 455 patients who received 
      lenvatinib as first-line systemic therapy for unresectable HCC represented the 
      present IPD. Data inclusion were adapted to those reported in the IMbrave150 trial. 
      RESULTS: Overall survival on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab proved to be superior to 
      lenvatinib (log-rank: 0.001) with a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% confidence interval 
      0.46-0.75). The number needed to treat ranged between seven in the first 12 months 
      and five at the 15th month. CONCLUSIONS: The present MAIC highlights that the 
      combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is superior to lenvatinib. However, 
      updated data or sub-analyses of the IMbrave150 trial would provide more robust 
      estimates for such a treatment comparison.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparison of palbociclib versus ribociclib and 
      abemaciclib in hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.
PG  - 457-467
LID - 10.2217/cer-2020-0272 [doi]
AB  - Aim: Palbociclib (PAL), ribociclib (RIB) and abemaciclib (ABM), in combination with 
      fulvestrant (FUL), are approved for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, 
      HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. This study aims to determine relative efficacy 
      of PAL+FUL versus RIB+FUL and ABM+FUL using matching-adjusted indirect treatment 
      comparisons. Patients & methods: Anchored matching-adjusted indirect treatment 
      comparisons were conducted using individual patient data from PALOMA-3 and published 
      summary-level data from MONARCH 2 and MONALEESA-3. The primary outcome was overall 
      survival (OS). Results: OS was similar for PAL+FUL versus ABM+FUL (hazard ratio: 
      0.87; 95% CI: 0.54-1.40) and RIB+FUL (hazard ratio: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.48-1.63). 
      Conclusion: Adjusting for cross-trial differences suggests similar OS between 
      treatments, underscoring the importance of accounting for these differences when 
      indirectly comparing treatments.

OAB - Lay abstract Palbociclib (PAL), ribociclib (RIB) and abemaciclib (ABM) are used with 
      fulvestrant to treat hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast 
      cancer. This study aims to use data from clinical trials to compare how long 
      patients live after starting treatment with PAL versus RIB and ABM. Since patients 
      who enroll in different trials may have different characteristics, it is important 
      to adjust for these differences for a more accurate comparison. Adjusting for these 
      differences showed that patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative 
      advanced breast cancer treated with PAL lived for a similar length of time compared 
      with those treated with RIB or ABM.

TI  - Preliminary Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Utility Analysis of Cemiplimab in Patients 
      with Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Italy.
PG  - 121-133
LID - 10.2147/CEOR.S295605 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a common cancer that in most 
      cases is curable with surgery. About 3-5% of patients develop advanced CSCC (aCSCC) 
      and are no longer responsive to surgery or radiation therapy. The aim of this study 
      was to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of cemiplimab, the first 
      systemic therapy approved in Italy for patients with aCSCC, vs platinum-based 
      chemotherapy from the Italian National Health Service (SSN) perspective. METHODS: A 
      partitioned survival model, which included three mutually exclusive health states, 
      was developed to estimate costs and outcomes for patients with aCSCC, over a 30-year 
      time horizon (lifetime). No direct evidence of the comparative efficacy and safety 
      of cemiplimab versus other therapies currently exists. Therefore, a simulated 
      treatment comparison (STC) was conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of 
      cemiplimab versus chemotherapy. Individual patient data for cemiplimab were 
      collected from the EMPOWER-CSCC 1 trial whereas chemotherapy data were derived from 
      a retrospective study. In the STC a regression model was used to predict outcomes 
      for cemiplimab in the population observed in the comparator study. Costs of drug 
      acquisition/administration and management of adverse events were included. Costs and 
      outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
      and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) were calculated; sensitivity and scenario 
      analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: In the 
      base-case, treatment with cemiplimab was associated with a gain of 4.89 LYs and 3.99 
      QALYs, compared with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, resulting in an 
      estimated ICER of 27,821 €/LY gained and an ICUR of 34,110 €/QALY gained. Both ICER 
      and ICUR were below the commonly used Italian SSN willingness to pay thresholds. 
      CONCLUSION: The use of cemiplimab, compared with a platinum-based chemotherapy 
      regimen, can be considered a cost-effective option for the treatment of aCSCC 
      patients in Italy.

TI  - Integrating efficacy and safety of vedolizumab compared with other advanced 
      therapies to assess net clinical benefit of ulcerative colitis treatments: a network 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 711-722
LID - 10.1080/17474124.2021.1880319 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Because only one head-to-head randomized trial of biologics for 
      moderate-to-severe UC has been performed, indirect treatment comparisons remain 
      important. This systematic review and network meta-analysis examined efficacy and 
      safety of biologics and tofacitinib for moderate-to-severe UC, using vedolizumab as 
      reference.Methods: Relevant studies (N = 19) of vedolizumab, adalimumab, infliximab, 
      golimumab, ustekinumab, and tofacitinib were identified. Study design differences 
      were addressed by assessing efficacy outcomes conditional on response at maintenance 
      initiation. Primary analysis used fixed-effect models to estimate odds ratios for 
      efficacy and safety endpoints.Results: Compared with vedolizumab 300 mg, adalimumab 
      160/80 mg was associated with less clinical remission (odds ratio, 0.69 [95% 
      credible interval, 0.54-0.88]), and infliximab 5 mg/kg was associated with more 
      clinical remission (1.67 [1.16-2.42]) and response (1.63 [1.15-2.30]). Adalimumab 40 
      mg, golimumab 50 mg, and ustekinumab 90 mg Q12W had significantly lower clinical 
      remission rates during maintenance (0.62 [0.45-0.86], 0.55 [0.32-0.95], and 0.59 
      [0.35-0.99]) versus vedolizumab 300 mg Q8W. Response results were similar. 
      Tofacitinib 10 mg had the highest maintenance treatment efficacy estimates and 
      highest infection risk.Conclusion: Network meta-analysis and novel integrated 
      benefit-risk analysis suggest a potentially favorable efficacy-safety balance for 
      vedolizumab vs adalimumab and other advanced UC therapies.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness Research for CAR-T Therapies in Multiple Myeloma: 
      Appropriate Comparisons Require Careful Considerations of Data Sources and Patient 
      Populations.
PG  - 201-210
LID - 10.1007/s40261-021-01012-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Registrational trials for ciltacabtagene autoleucel 
      [cilta-cel]) and idecabtagene vicleucel [ide-cel] chimeric antigen receptor T-cell 
      (CAR-T) therapies were single-arm studies conducted with relapse refractory multiple 
      myeloma (MM) patients who were triple-class-exposed (TCE) or triple-class-refractory 
      (TCR). It is critical for researchers conducting comparative effectiveness research 
      (CER) to carefully consider the most appropriate data sources and comparable patient 
      populations. The aim of this study was to identify potential data sources and 
      populations for comparing to single-arm CAR-T trials CARTITUDE-1 (cilta-cel) and 
      KarMMa (ide-cel). METHODS: A 2-part global systematic literature search produced a 
      review of (1) clinical trials of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
      guideline preferred regimens in previously treated MM, and (2) real-world data 
      cohorts of TCE or TCR populations, published between 1/1/2015 and 12/10/2020, with 
      sample sizes of > 50 patients and reporting survival-related outcomes. Implications 
      on CER and accepted best practices are discussed. RESULTS: Nine clinical trials of 
      NCCN preferred regimens were identified along with five real-world data-based 
      publications. No clinical trials evaluated patients with TCE or TCR MM. Among the 
      real-world data-based publications, two evaluated patients exclusively with TCR MM, 
      two analyzed a mixed population of patients with TCE or TCR MM, and one publication 
      assessed patients exclusively with TCE MM. Real-world data treatment patterns were 
      heterogeneous. CONCLUSION: Current NCCN preferred regimens were not specifically 
      studied in TCE or TCR MM patients, although some studies do include a proportion of 
      these types of patients. Therefore, appropriate matching of populations using either 
      real-world data or patient level clinical trial data is critical to putting trials 
      of novel CAR-Ts (i.e., CARTITUDE-1 or KarMMa) into appropriate comparative context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approved first-line treatments for patients with BRAF V600-mutant 
      advanced melanoma include nivolumab (a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor) 
      plus ipilimumab (a cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitor; NIVO+IPI) and the 
      BRAF/MEK inhibitors dabrafenib plus trametinib (DAB+TRAM), encorafenib plus 
      binimetinib (ENCO+BINI), and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib (VEM+COBI). Results from 
      prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing these treatments have not 
      yet been reported. This analysis evaluated the relative efficacy and safety of 
      NIVO+IPI versus DAB+TRAM, ENCO+BINI, and VEM+COBI in patients with BRAF-mutant 
      advanced melanoma using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: A systematic literature review identified RCTs for DAB+TRAM, ENCO+BINI, and 
      VEM+COBI in patients with BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma. Individual patient-level 
      data for NIVO+IPI were derived from the phase III CheckMate 067 trial (BRAF-mutant 
      cohort) and restricted to match the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the comparator 
      trials. Treatment effects for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival 
      (PFS) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards and time-varying hazard ratio 
      (HR) models. Safety outcomes (grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events) with 
      NIVO+IPI and the comparators were compared. RESULTS: In the Cox proportional hazards 
      analysis, NIVO+IPI showed improved OS compared with DAB+TRAM (HR = 0.53; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.73), ENCO+BINI (HR = 0.60; CI, 0.42-0.85), and 
      VEM+COBI (HR = 0.50; CI, 0.36-0.70) for the overall study period. In the 
      time-varying analysis, NIVO+IPI was associated with significant improvements in OS 
      and PFS compared with the BRAF/MEK inhibitors 12 months after treatment initiation. 
      There were no significant differences between NIVO+IPI and BRAF/MEK inhibitor 
      treatment from 0 to 12 months. Safety outcomes favored DAB+TRAM over NIVO+IPI, 
      whereas NIVO+IPI was comparable to VEM+COBI. CONCLUSION: Results of this MAIC 
      demonstrated durable OS and PFS benefits for patients with BRAF-mutant advanced 
      melanoma treated with NIVO+IPI compared with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, with the greatest 
      benefits noted after 12 months.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Among patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), 
      randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of biologics, such as 
      anti-interleukin-4/interleukin-13 (dupilumab) and anti-immunoglobulin E 
      (omalizumab), have demonstrated efficacy compared with intranasal corticosteroids 
      (INCS). However, no head-to-head RCTs exist between biologics. OBJECTIVE: To perform 
      an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of the efficacy of biologics plus INCS versus 
      placebo (INCS) as a common comparator. METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane were 
      searched for RCTs of biologics in CRSwNP. Bucher ITCs were performed for outcomes at 
      week 24: nasal polyp score (NPS) (range, 0-8), nasal congestion (NC) (range, 0-3), 
      loss of smell (range, 0-3), University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test 
      (range, 0-40), total symptom score (range, 0-12), 22-item sinonasal outcome test 
      (range, 0-110), and responder analyses based on NPS or NC improvement of 1 point or 
      greater. RESULTS: Assessment of trial design, baseline characteristics, and outcome 
      measures suggested that ITC was feasible with four phase 3 RCTs: dupilumab SINUS-24 
      and SINUS-52 (NCT02912468/NCT02898454) and omalizumab POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 
      (NCT03280550/NCT03280537). In the intent-to-treat population, dupilumab had 
      significantly greater improvements from baseline to week 24 versus omalizumab across 
      key outcomes: NPS (least squares mean difference [95% confidence interval], -1.04 
      [-1.63 to -0.44]), NC (-0.35 [-0.60 to -0.11]), loss of smell (-0.66 [-0.90 
      to -0.42]), University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (6.70 [4.67-8.73]), 
      and total symptom score (-1.18 [-1.95 to -0.41]). Improvement in the 22-item 
      sinonasal outcome test was greater in dupilumab versus omalizumab but was not 
      statistically significant. Dupilumab patients were significantly more likely to 
      achieve ≥1-point improvement in NPS (odds ratio [95% CI] = 3.58 [1.82-7.04]) and NC 
      (2.13 [1.12-4.04]) versus omalizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Although ITCs have limitations, 
      these results demonstrated that dupilumab had consistently greater improvements in 
      key CRSwNP outcomes versus omalizumab at week 24.

TI  - A Systematic Literature Review and Indirect Treatment Comparison of Efficacy of 
      Repository Corticotropin Injection versus Synthetic Adrenocorticotropic Hormone for 
      Infantile Spasms.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.36469/jheor.2021.18727 [doi]
AB  - Background: Infantile spasms is a rare disease characterized by distinct seizures 
      and hypsarrhythmia. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is available as a natural 
      product (repository corticotropin injection, [RCI]; Acthar® Gel) and as synthetic 
      analogs. RCI is a naturally-sourced complex mixture of purified ACTH analogs and 
      other pituitary peptides approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration 
      as a monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms. RCI is commonly used in the 
      United States. Outside the United States, synthetic analogs of ACTH-synthetic 
      ACTH1-24 (tetracosactide) and synthetic ACTH1-39 (corticotropin 
      carboxymethyl-cellulose [CCMC])-are used. The efficacy of RCI may differ from that 
      of synthetic ACTH treatments based on the structure of peptide; however, no 
      head-to-head clinical trials have compared the efficacy of RCI and synthetic ACTH 
      treatments. Objective: A systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 
      clinical trials was conducted to assess the comparative efficacy of RCI and 
      synthetic ACTH treatments in infantile spasms. Methods: A search was conducted in 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases through September 30, 2020. Relevant 
      clinical trials on RCI or synthetic ACTH therapy and reporting either cessation of 
      spasms or resolution of hypsarrhythmia, separately or as a combined outcome were 
      included. A Bayesian indirect treatment comparison using a fixed-effects model was 
      used for comparative efficacy. Results: Of 473 citations screened, 21 studies were 
      reviewed qualitatively. In the indirect treatment comparison of six eligible 
      clinical trial studies, the odds of achieving efficacy outcomes were five to eight 
      times greater with RCI than with tetracosactide and 14 to 16 times greater than 
      CCMC. This translated to a risk reduction of 10% to 14% and 40% to 50% with RCI 
      versus tetracosactide and CCMC, respectively. For every two to five patients 
      treated, RCI improved efficacy outcomes in one additional patient compared to 
      synthetic ACTH (adjusted number needed-to-treat). Conclusions: Based on the 
      available limited evidence, results suggest RCI may be more efficacious for 
      infantile spasms than synthetic ACTH treatments. Our findings provide a blueprint to 
      inform the design of future prospective studies for the treatment of infantile 
      spasms.

TI  - Effectiveness of convective water vapor energy therapy versus prostatic urethral 
      lift for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review and indirect 
      comparison.
PG  - 3207-3215
LID - 10.1007/s00345-021-03595-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To synthesize the evidence from randomized controlled trials of prostatic 
      urethral lift (PUL) and convective water vapor thermal energy therapy (WAVE) for 
      minimally invasive treatment of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. METHODS: A 
      systematic search of databases was performed to identify trials comparing WAVE or 
      PUL to either an active or sham surgery control in subjects with symptomatic benign 
      prostatic obstruction. A controlled indirect treatment comparison based on the 
      approach of Bucher was performed for outcomes including International Prostate 
      Symptom Score and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). The durability of treatment 
      response was assessed by life-table analysis of freedom from retreatment through 
      4 years. RESULTS: Two multicenter sham-controlled trials (Rezum II Study, 
      NCT01912339: LIFT Study, NCT01294150) were identified. The trials employed a common 
      sham procedure and were similar with respect to their designs and subjects' baseline 
      characteristics. Comparisons on the treatment effect in excess of sham response 
      found non-significant differences between WAVE and PUL for symptom score [mean 
      difference (MD): - 1.7 points; 95% confidence interval (CI): - 4.8, 1.4] but Qmax 
      improvements favored WAVE [MD: 3.4 ml/sec; CI: 1.2, 5.6]. The proportion free of 
      retreatment through 4 years was 89.1% for WAVE versus 75.4% for PUL [log-rank 
      P = 0.004]. CONCLUSIONS: PUL and WAVE provide similar subjective improvements but 
      flow-rate improvement and durability of response seem greater for WAVE. The 
      confirmation of these findings in a randomized trial is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peginterferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate (GA) are approved 
      first-line therapies for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, but 
      their therapeutic efficacy has not been compared directly. METHODS: Clinical 
      outcomes at 2 years, including no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), for patients 
      receiving peginterferon beta-1a 125 mcg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or GA 20 mg/ml once 
      daily (QD) were compared by propensity score matching analysis using individual 
      patient data from ADVANCE and CONFIRM phase III clinical trials. In addition, 
      clinical outcomes at 1-3 years for patients receiving peginterferon beta-1a Q2W or 
      GA 40 mg/ml three times a week (TIW) were evaluated using a matching-adjusted 
      comparison analysis of individual patient data from ADVANCE and the ADVANCE 
      extension study, ATTAIN, and aggregate patient data from the phase III GALA and the 
      GALA extension studies. RESULTS: Propensity-score-matched peginterferon beta-1a 
      patients (n = 336) had a significantly lower annualized relapse rate [ARR (0.204 
      versus 0.282); rate ratio = 0.724; p = 0.045], a significantly lower probability of 
      12-week confirmed disability worsening (10.0% versus 14.6%; hazard ratio = 0.625; 
      p = 0.048), and a significantly higher rate of NEDA (20.3% versus 11.5%; p = 0.047) 
      compared with GA 20 mg/ml QD patients after 2 years of treatment. Matching-adjusted 
      peginterferon beta-1a patients (effective n = 276) demonstrated a similar ARR at 1 
      year (0.278 versus 0.318; p = 0.375) and significantly lower ARR at 2 years (0.0901 
      versus 0.203; p = 0.032) and 3 years (0.109 versus 0.209; p = 0.047) compared with 
      GA 40 mg/ml TIW patients (n = 834). CONCLUSION: Results from separate matching 
      comparisons of phase III clinical trials and extension studies suggest that 
      peginterferon beta-1a 125 mcg Q2W may provide better clinical outcomes than GA (20 
      mg/ml QD or 40 mg/ml TIW).

AB  - The Clinical Trials Subcommittee of the International Headache Society presents the 
      first Health Technology Assessment for the Acute Treatment of Migraine Attacks and 
      Prevention of Migraine. Health technology assessments are systematic evaluations of 
      the properties, effects, and consequences of healthcare technologies; this position 
      statement is designed to inform decision makers about access to and reimbursement 
      for medications and devices for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. This 
      position statement extends beyond the already available guidelines on randomized 
      controlled trials for migraine to incorporate real-world evidence and a synthetic 
      approach for considering multiple data sources and modelling methods when assessing 
      the value of migraine treatments.

TI  - Meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of inhaled ciprofloxacin in non-cystic fibrosis 
      bronchiectasis patients.
PG  - 1505-1512
LID - 10.1111/imj.15210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: No antibiotic therapies have been approved for reducing exacerbations 
      and preventing disease progression in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) 
      patients. Several recent clinical studies have investigated the feasibility of 
      inhaled ciprofloxacin in NCFB, whereas the results were controversial. AIM: No 
      antibiotic therapies have been approved for reducing exacerbations and preventing 
      disease progression in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) patients. Several 
      recent clinical studies have investigated the feasibility of inhaled ciprofloxacin 
      in NCFB, whereas the results were controversial. We conducted the present 
      meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of inhalation of 
      ciprofloxacin in NCFB. METHODS: Electrical databases Medline and Cochrane library 
      were retrieved from inception through December 2019. Randomised controlled trials 
      (RCT) comparing inhaled ciprofloxacin and placebo were selected. The primary 
      outcomes were time to first exacerbation, frequency of exacerbations and the change 
      in sputum Pseudomonas aeruginosa density. RESULTS: A total of five articles 
      involving six RCT was finally included in the analysis. The time to first 
      exacerbation was significantly prolonged by inhaled ciprofloxacin (hazard ratio: 
      0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.82), with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 23%). 
      Inhalation of ciprofloxacin significantly reduced frequency of exacerbations (risk 
      ratio: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.61-0.79) and decreased density of sputum P. aeruginosa 
      (weighted mean difference: -2.11 log(10) CFU/g, 95% CI: -2.96 to -1.27 log(10) 
      CFU/g) compared with placebo. No significant between-group differences in mortality, 
      adverse events and discontinuation rate were observed. Further indirect treatment 
      comparison showed no differences between the two types of inhaled ciprofloxacin in 
      all outcomes of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin inhalation treatment 
      significantly prolonged the time to first exacerbation, reduced the frequency of 
      exacerbations and decreased sputum P. aeruginosa density and was well tolerated. 
      Ciprofloxacin inhalation is promising in the treatment of NCFB.

TI  - The cost-effectiveness of glasdegib in combination with low-dose cytarabine, for the 
      treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in adult patients who are not 
      eligible to receive intensive induction chemotherapy in Canada.
PG  - 150-161
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2021.1875743 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The clinical efficacy and safety of DAURISMO (glasdegib) combined with low-dose 
      cytarabine (LDAC) were demonstrated in the BRIGHT AML 1003 study among newly 
      diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients who are not eligible to receive intensive 
      chemotherapy. This study aims to evaluate its cost-effectiveness versus LDAC alone 
      and azacitidine from a Canadian payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      partitioned-survival model was developed with three health states: progression-free 
      survival (PFS), relapse/progression and death. Clinical inputs were obtained from 
      the BRIGHT AML 1003 study for glasdegib and LDAC, and from the two trial 
      publications and indirect treatment comparison for azacitidine. Drug 
      acquisition/administration, disease management, adverse event and end-of-life costs 
      were considered. All costs were measured in Canadian dollars. Cost-effectiveness of 
      glasdegib + LDAC was assessed against LDAC alone in main population, and against 
      azacitidine by bone marrow blasts (BMB). A weighted average ICER was calculated to 
      represent the current treatment use of Canadian clinical practice. The 
      reference-case analysis was conducted probabilistically, and numerous probabilistic 
      scenario analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
      (ICERs) compared to LDAC alone was CAD $177,065 (a mean gain of 0.41 QALYs and an 
      incremental cost of CAD $72,695), to azacitidine in 20-30% and >30% BMB group were 
      CAD $178,201 (a mean gain of 0.34 QALYs and an incremental cost of CAD $59,889) and 
      dominant (a mean gain of 0.28 QALYs while reducing costs by CAD $7,856) 
      respectively, resulting in a weighted average ICER of CAD $81,310 per QALY. 
      LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Though uncertainties remain with the generated PFS 
      curve, the derived azacitidine curves, administration and vial wastage, the model 
      has been built under the best available evidence and relied on clinical opinions 
      where there were data gaps. The weighted average ICER suggests that glasdegib + LDAC 
      is cost-effective at a CAD $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.

TI  - Joining the Dots: Linking Disconnected Networks of Evidence Using Dose-Response 
      Model-Based Network Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 194-208
LID - 10.1177/0272989X20983315 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Network meta-analysis (NMA) synthesizes direct and indirect evidence on 
      multiple treatments to estimate their relative effectiveness. However, comparisons 
      between disconnected treatments are not possible without making strong assumptions. 
      When studies including multiple doses of the same drug are available, model-based 
      NMA (MBNMA) presents a novel solution to this problem by modeling a parametric 
      dose-response relationship within an NMA framework. In this article, we illustrate 
      several scenarios in which dose-response MBNMA can connect and strengthen evidence 
      networks. METHODS: We created illustrative data sets by removing studies or 
      treatments from an NMA of triptans for migraine relief. We fitted MBNMA models with 
      different dose-response relationships. For connected networks, we compared MBNMA 
      estimates with NMA estimates. For disconnected networks, we compared MBNMA estimates 
      with NMA estimates from an "augmented" network connected by adding studies or 
      treatments back into the data set. RESULTS: In connected networks, relative effect 
      estimates from MBNMA were more precise than those from NMA models (ratio of 
      posterior SDs NMA v. MBNMA: median = 1.13; range = 1.04-1.68). In disconnected 
      networks, MBNMA provided estimates for all treatments where NMA could not and were 
      consistent with NMA estimates from augmented networks for 15 of 18 data sets. In the 
      remaining 3 of 18 data sets, a more complex dose-response relationship was required 
      than could be fitted with the available evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Where information on 
      multiple doses is available, MBNMA can connect disconnected networks and increase 
      precision while making less strong assumptions than alternative approaches. MBNMA 
      relies on correct specification of the dose-response relationship, which requires 
      sufficient data at different doses to allow reliable estimation. We recommend that 
      systematic reviews for NMA search for and include evidence (including phase II 
      trials) on multiple doses of agents where available.

LID - 10.2217/cer-2020-0236 [doi]
AB  - Aims: To compare the efficacy of nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with 
      regorafenib 160 mg, cabozantinib 60 mg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy for 
      second-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Materials & methods: 
      Indirect comparison using network meta-analysis and propensity score weighting. 
      Results: Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg had significantly higher objective 
      response rate (median 31.2% [95% credible interval: 19.6-44.5%]) than cabozantinib 
      (4.2% [2.0-6.5%]) and regorafenib (4.8% [1.1-8.3%]), and significantly longer 
      overall survival (cabozantinib: hazard ratio: 0.46 [95% credible interval: 
      0.27-0.79]; regorafenib: 0.56 [0.32-0.97]). Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 
      mg/kg had significantly better objective response rate (difference 21.0% 
      [4.5-37.5%]) and overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.58 [0.35-0.96]) than nivolumab 
      monotherapy. Conclusion: Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg had a superior 
      efficacy versus cabozantinib 60 mg, regorafenib 160 mg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
      monotherapy as second-line therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

TI  - Comparability of European League Against Rheumatology-Recommended Pharmacological 
      Treatments of Oral Ulcers Associated with Behçet's Disease: A Systematic Literature 
      Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 323-335
LID - 10.2147/OARRR.S277036 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral ulcers are the cardinal manifestation in Behçet's disease (BD). The 
      2018 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations describe treatments 
      for BD-associated oral ulcers with mucocutaneous involvement; however, little 
      comparative effectiveness information for these agents is available. In the absence 
      of head-to-head trials, an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) could provide useful 
      evidence regarding comparative effectiveness of BD treatments. The purpose of this 
      study was to conduct a comparative systematic literature review (SLR) and similarity 
      assessment of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the oral 
      ulcer-related efficacy outcomes of EULAR-recommended treatments for BD-associated 
      oral ulcers to determine the feasibility of an ITC. METHODS: An SLR was performed to 
      identify relevant RCTs indexed in MEDLINE/Embase before May 29, 2019. RCT 
      similarities for the ITC were assessed based on a step-wise process recommended by 
      the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research. RESULTS: In 
      total, 317 articles were identified, of which 14 RCTs, reflecting 11 
      EULAR-recommended treatments, were evaluated in a similarity assessment. Number of 
      oral ulcers, resolution of oral ulcers, and healing time for oral ulcers were 
      identified as the possible oral ulcer-related outcomes. After completing the 
      similarity assessment of these outcomes, it was determined that a robust ITC was 
      infeasible for the three oral ulcer-related outcomes due to heterogeneity in 
      outcomes reporting, study design, and/or patient characteristics. More broadly, the 
      results underscore the need for and consistent use of standardized measures for oral 
      ulcer outcomes to facilitate comparative research. CONCLUSION: In the absence of 
      head-to-head RCTs and infeasibility of quantitative ITC, comparative assessments for 
      BD-associated oral ulcers are limited, including comparative effectiveness and 
      cost-effectiveness evaluations. Healthcare decision-makers must continue to base 
      treatment decisions on the extent and strength of available evidence (eg, robust 
      RCTs), clinical guidelines, real-world experience, and patient considerations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of individual patient data (IPD) in network meta-analyses (NMA) 
      is rapidly growing. This study aimed to determine, through simulations, the impact 
      of select factors on the validity and precision of NMA estimates when combining IPD 
      and aggregate data (AgD) relative to using AgD only. METHODS: Three analysis 
      strategies were compared via simulations: 1) AgD NMA without adjustments (AgD-NMA); 
      2) AgD NMA with meta-regression (AgD-NMA-MR); and 3) IPD-AgD NMA with 
      meta-regression (IPD-NMA). We compared 108 parameter permutations: number of network 
      nodes (3, 5 or 10); proportion of treatment comparisons informed by IPD (low, medium 
      or high); equal size trials (2-armed with 200 patients per arm) or larger IPD trials 
      (500 patients per arm); sparse or well-populated networks; and type of 
      effect-modification (none, constant across treatment comparisons, or exchangeable). 
      Data were generated over 200 simulations for each combination of parameters, each 
      using linear regression with Normal distributions. To assess model performance and 
      estimate validity, the mean squared error (MSE) and bias of treatment-effect and 
      covariate estimates were collected. Standard errors (SE) and percentiles were used 
      to compare estimate precision. RESULTS: Overall, IPD-NMA performed best in terms of 
      validity and precision. The median MSE was lower in the IPD-NMA in 88 of 108 
      scenarios (similar results otherwise). On average, the IPD-NMA median MSE was 0.54 
      times the median using AgD-NMA-MR. Similarly, the SEs of the IPD-NMA 
      treatment-effect estimates were 1/5 the size of AgD-NMA-MR SEs. The magnitude of 
      superior validity and precision of using IPD-NMA varied across scenarios and was 
      associated with the amount of IPD. Using IPD in small or sparse networks 
      consistently led to improved validity and precision; however, in large/dense 
      networks IPD tended to have negligible impact if too few IPD were included. Similar 
      results also apply to the meta-regression coefficient estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      simulation study suggests that the use of IPD in NMA will considerably improve the 
      validity and precision of estimates of treatment effect and regression coefficients 
      in the most NMA IPD data-scenarios. However, IPD may not add meaningful validity and 
      precision to NMAs of large and dense treatment networks when negligible IPD are 
      used.

TI  - Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Once-Weekly Semaglutide 1 mg Versus 
      Empagliflozin 25 mg for Treatment of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in the UK 
      Setting.
PG  - 537-555
LID - 10.1007/s13300-020-00989-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes represents a continuing healthcare challenge, and 
      choosing cost-effective treatments is crucial to ensure that healthcare resources 
      are used efficiently. The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of 
      once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycaemic control on 
      metformin monotherapy from a healthcare payer perspective in the UK. METHODS: 
      Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. 
      Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects of initiation of once-weekly 
      semaglutide 1 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg were based on an indirect comparison 
      conducted using patient-level data, as there is currently no head-to-head clinical 
      trial comparing these therapies. Modelled patients received treatments until 
      glycated haemoglobin exceeded 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), at which point patients initiated 
      basal insulin. The analysis captured pharmacy costs and costs of diabetes-related 
      complications, expressed in 2019 pounds sterling (GBP). Projected outcomes were 
      discounted at 3.5% annually. Scenario analyses were prepared to assess uncertainty 
      around projected outcomes. RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with 
      increases in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.12 years and 
      0.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, compared with empagliflozin 
      25 mg. Projected improvements in quality and duration of life resulted from a 
      reduced cumulative incidence and a delayed time to onset of diabetes-related 
      complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with increased pharmacy costs, 
      but this was partially offset by avoided costs of treating complications. 
      Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with an increase in costs of GBP 1017 per 
      patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 4439 per QALY 
      gained. CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was projected to be a 
      cost-effective treatment option from a healthcare payer perspective compared with 
      empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK 
      setting.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of valbenazine compared with deutetrabenazine for the treatment

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate clinical and economic outcomes associated with valbenazine 
      compared with deutetrabenazine in patients with tardive dyskinesia (TD) using a 
      model that accounts for multiple dimensions of patient health status. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A discretely integrated condition event model was developed to evaluate the 
      cost-effectiveness of treatment with valbenazine and deutetrabenazine in a synthetic 
      cohort of 1,000 patients with TD who were receiving antipsychotic medication to 
      treat an underlying psychiatric disorder. Clinical inputs were derived from relevant 
      clinical trials or from publicly available sources. Patients were assessed over 
      1 year using ≥50% improvement from baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale 
      (AIMS) total score as the primary definition of response. Response at 1 year using 
      Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) score ≤2 was also assessed. Health 
      outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), life years, proportion 
      responding to treatment at 1 year, and number of psychiatric relapses. RESULTS: 
      Regardless of the definition used for response, patients treated with valbenazine 
      were more likely to have responded to treatment at 1 year, lived longer, and accrued 
      more QALYs than patients who received deutetrabenazine. Using the AIMS response 
      criterion, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $9,951/QALY for valbenazine 
      compared with deutetrabenazine. By comparison, using the CGIC response criterion 
      valbenazine dominated deutetrabenazine with valbenazine-treated patients 
      accumulating more QALYs (3.4 vs 3.3 years) and incurring lower lifetime costs 
      ($252,311 vs $283,208) than deutetrabenazine-treated patients. LIMITATIONS: There 
      are no head-to-head trials of valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, so probabilities of 
      response used in the model were calculated based on an indirect treatment comparison 
      of results from individual trials with one drug or the other, using only those 
      metrics reported across trials. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with TD, treatment with 
      valbenazine is highly cost-effective compared with deutetrabenazine.

TI  - Recombinant FVIIIFc Versus BAY 94-9027 for Treatment of Patients with Haemophilia A: 
      Comparative Efficacy Using a Matching Adjusted Indirect Comparison.
PG  - 1263-1274
LID - 10.1007/s12325-020-01599-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) is the current 
      standard of care for haemophilia A. Several approaches have been used to extend the 
      half-life of rFVIII to improve prophylaxis outcomes. An indirect comparison of 
      pivotal clinical trial data was performed to evaluate the relative efficacy of two 
      extended half-life therapies approved for the prophylactic treatment of 
      haemophilia A: recombinant FVIII-IgG(1) Fc domain fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) and 
      pegylated rFVIII (BAY 94-9027). METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      (MAIC) was conducted to compare the rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis arm of the 
      A-LONG phase III clinical trial (n = 117) and the BAY 94-9027 approved dosing 
      regimens of the PROTECT VIII phase II/III study (n = 110). Following matching for 
      baseline characteristics, mean annualised bleeding rate (ABR) and the proportion of 
      patients with zero bleeds were compared for rFVIIIFc and BAY 94-9027. Additional 
      supportive analyses comparing rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis and the individual 
      prophylaxis regimens included in the PROTECT VIII group (twice weekly, and every 5 
      and 7 days [Q5D and Q7D]) were conducted. RESULTS: Mean ABR was lower in the 
      rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis group versus the BAY 94-9027 pooled prophylaxis 
      population (3.0 versus 4.9), providing a clinically relevant and statistically 
      significant difference (mean difference [MD] - 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      - 3.5 to - 0.4). A statistically significant difference in ABR was also observed for 
      rFVIIIFc compared with BAY 94-9027 Q7D (3.2 versus 6.4; MD - 3.3; 95% CI - 6.4 to 
      - 0.2). The difference in the proportion of patients with zero bleeds between 
      rFVIIIFc (46.5%) and BAY 94-9027 pooled prophylaxis population (38.2%) was not 
      statistically significant (odds ratio 1.4; 95% CI 0.8 to 2.5). CONCLUSIONS: This 
      indirect treatment comparison indicates a statistically significant and clinically 
      relevant difference in ABR favouring individualised prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc versus 
      BAY 94-9027 prophylaxis. The proportion of patients with zero bleeds was numerically 
      greater with rFVIIIFc treatment but did not achieve statistical significance.

AB  - The increasing body of literature describing the role of host factors in COVID-19 
      pathogenesis demonstrates the need to combine diverse, multi-omic data to evaluate 
      and substantiate the most robust evidence and inform development of therapies. Here 
      we present a dynamic ranking of host genes implicated in human betacoronavirus 
      infection (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, seasonal coronaviruses). We conducted an 
      extensive systematic review of experiments identifying potential host factors. Gene 
      lists from diverse sources were integrated using Meta-Analysis by Information 
      Content (MAIC). This previously described algorithm uses data-driven gene list 
      weightings to produce a comprehensive ranked list of implicated host genes. From 32 
      datasets, the top ranked gene was PPIA, encoding cyclophilin A, a druggable target 
      using cyclosporine. Other highly-ranked genes included proposed prognostic factors 
      (CXCL10, CD4, CD3E) and investigational therapeutic targets (IL1A) for COVID-19. 
      Gene rankings also inform the interpretation of COVID-19 GWAS results, implicating 
      FYCO1 over other nearby genes in a disease-associated locus on chromosome 3. 
      Researchers can search and review the gene rankings and the contribution of 
      different experimental methods to gene rank at https://baillielab.net/maic/covid19 . 
      As new data are published we will regularly update the list of genes as a resource 
      to inform and prioritise future studies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lower-dose ceritinib (450 mg) once-daily with food was approved in 
      2018 in Hong Kong (HK) for first-line treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
      kinase-positive (ALK +) advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study 
      examined the cost-effectiveness of ceritinib vs. crizotinib in the first-line 
      treatment of ALK + NSCLC from a HK healthcare service provider's or government's 
      perspective. METHODS: Costs and effectiveness of first-line ceritinib vs. crizotinib 
      over a 20-year time horizon was evaluated using a partitioned survival model with 
      three health states (stable disease, progressed disease, and death). The efficacy 
      data for ceritinib were obtained from a phase 3 trial comparing ceritinib with 
      chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (ASCEND-4) and extrapolated 
      using parametric survival models. Long-term survival associated with crizotinib were 
      estimated using hazard ratio of crizotinib vs. ceritinib obtained from 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison based on ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014 trials. 
      Drug acquisition, administration, adverse events costs, and medical costs associated 
      with each health state were obtained from public sources and converted to 2018 US 
      Dollars. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY) 
      gained were estimated for ceritinib vs. crizotinib. RESULTS: The base case results 
      showed that ceritinib was associated with 3.22 QALYs, 4.51 LYs, and total costs of 
      $157,581 over 20 years. Patients receiving crizotinib had 2.68 QALYs, 3.85 LYs, and 
      $150,424 total costs over the same time horizon. The incremental cost per QALY 
      gained for ceritinib vs crizotinib was $13,343. Results were robust to deterministic 
      sensitivity analyses in most scenarios. CONCLUSION: Ceritinib offers a 
      cost-effective option compared to crizotinib for previously untreated ALK + advanced 
      NCSLC in HK.

LID - 10.3390/cancers12123648 [doi]
LID - 3648
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of head-to-head trials, this study indirectly compared 
      the effectiveness of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs nivolumab + ipilimumab for the 
      first-line treatment of metastatic stage IV NSCLC patients with PD-L1 tumor 
      proportion score (TPS) ≥1%. METHODS: An anchored matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison (MAIC) was conducted using pooled individual patient data (IPD) from the 
      ITT population in KEYNOTE-021G, KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 (n = 816) and published 
      aggregate data of nivolumab + ipilimumab from CheckMate 227 Part 1A (n = 793). To 
      adjust for cross-trial differences in baseline characteristics, data from 
      KEYNOTE-021G/KEYNOTE-189/KEYNOTE-407 were re-weighted to match the baseline 
      characteristics of CheckMate 227 Part 1A. Outcomes included OS, PFS and ORR. Base 
      case analyses were restricted to patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥1%, with sub-group 
      analyses in PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and 1-49%. RESULTS: The estimated HR (95% CI) of 
      pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs nivolumab + ipilimumab was 0.80 (0.59,1.09) and 0.53 
      (0.41,0.68) for OS and PFS, respectively. For ORR, the estimated risk ratio was 1.8 
      (1.3,2.4) for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs nivolumab + ipilimumab and the risk 
      difference was 25.5% (15.0,36.0). PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and 1-49% sub-groups showed an OS 
      HR of 0.89 (0.58,1.36) and 0.68 (0.46,1.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: These MAIC 
      results suggest that pembrolizumab + chemotherapy leads to a greater clinical 
      benefit vs nivolumab + ipilimumab in patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥1% across multiple 
      endpoints.

TI  - Choice across 10 pharmacologic combination strategies for type 2 diabetes: a 
      cost-effectiveness analysis.

LID - 378
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines recommend a stepped-escalation treatment strategy 
      for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Across multiple treatment strategies varying in efficacy 
      and costs, no clinical or economic studies directly compared them. This study aims 
      to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of 10 commonly used pharmacologic 
      combination strategies for T2DM. METHODS: Based on Chinese guideline and practice, 
      10 three-stepwise add-on strategies were identified, which start with metformin, 
      then switch to metformin plus one oral drug (i.e., sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, 
      α-glucosidase inhibitor, glinide, or DPP-4 inhibitor) as second line, and finally 
      switch to metformin plus one injection (i.e., insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonist) as 
      third line. A cohort of 10,000 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was 
      established. From a healthcare system perspective, the Cardiff model was used to 
      estimate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies, with clinical data sourced from a 
      systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 324 trials, costs from claims 
      data of 1164 T2DM patients, and utilities from an EQ-5D study. Outcome measures 
      include costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs). RESULTS: Over 40-year simulation, 
      the costs accumulated for a patient ranged from $7661 with strategy 1 to $14,273 
      with strategy 10, while the QALY gains ranged from 13.965 with strategy 1 to 14.117 
      with strategy 8. Strategy 7 was dominant over seven strategies (strategies 2~6, 
      9~10) with higher QALYs but lower costs. Additionally, at a willingness-to-pay 
      threshold of $30,787/QALY (i.e., 3 times GDP/capita for China), strategy 7 was 
      cost-effective compared with strategy 1 (ICER of strategy 7 vs. 1, $3371/QALY) and 
      strategy 8 (ICER of strategy 8 vs. 7, $132,790/QALY). Ranking the strategies by 
      ICERs and NMBs, strategy 7 provided the best value for money when compared to all 
      other strategies, followed by strategies 5, 9, 8, 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, and 4. Scenario 
      analyses showed that patients insist on pharmacologic treatments increased their 
      QALYs (0.456~0.653) at an acceptable range of cost increase (ICERs, 
      $1450/QALY~$12,360/QALY) or even at cost saving compared with those not receive 
      treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence-based references for diabetes 
      management. Our findings can be used to design the essential drug formulary, infer 
      clinical practice, and help the decision-maker design reimbursement policy.

BTI - Pharmacoeconomic Report: Halobetasol Propionate and Tazarotene (Duobrii): (Bausch 
      Health, Canada Inc.): Indication: Psoriasis, moderate-to-severe plaque
AB  - Based on the substantial limitations with the submitted economic evaluation 
      identified by CADTH: It is unclear whether the clinical efficacy data (i.e., Study 
      301, Study 302, and indirect treatment comparison [ITC]) which appears to have 
      assessed halobetasol propionate (HP) 0.01% weight by weight (w/w) plus tazarotene 
      (TAZ) 0.045% w/w as monotherapy in patients with more mild plaque psoriasis could be 
      generalized to patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, who are likely to 
      be concurrently on systemic or biologic therapies. The comparative efficacy of 
      HP/TAZ compared with other active topical therapies (including betamethasone 
      dipropionate [BD] 0.5 mg/g and calcipotriol [CAL] 50 mcg/g) is uncertain. The 
      cost-effectiveness of HP/TAZ compared with relevant comparators for the treatment of 
      patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis remains uncertain. CADTH 
      reanalyses estimated that HP/TAZ is associated with a gain of 0.0004 
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with BD/CAL, resulting in an 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $85,670 per QALY. This estimate of 
      the cost-effectiveness may be more representative of patients with a milder plaque 
      psoriasis than the proposed indication, who are eligible to receive topical 
      monotherapy and do not have access to phototherapy. CADTH illustrated that the ICERs 
      are highly sensitive to changes in parameter values, and thus, the 
      cost-effectiveness estimates for HP/TAZ in this setting should be interpreted with 
      caution. While the drug cost of HP/TAZ is less than the cost of the individual 
      components based on a per gram list prices, HP/TAZ is more expensive than other 
      relevant comparators such as BD/CAL.

BTI - Brivaracetam versus Levetiracetam for Epilepsy: A Review of Comparative Clinical 
      Safety
AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by spontaneous seizures 
      and can be associated with genetic disorders, occur secondary to conditions 
      affecting the central nervous system or can be due to unknown etiology. In Canada, 
      it has been estimated that around 300,000 people are living with epilepsy based on 
      The Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (September 2017). Anti-epileptic 
      drugs (AED) are the mainstay of pharmacological management of epilepsy. Often, 
      patients are treated with multiple AEDs, which are decided based on factors related 
      to patients (e.g., age, type and frequency of seizures, comorbidities), and drugs 
      (e.g., drug interactions, safety profile). Brivaracetam (BRV) is an AED in the 
      racetam group which was discovered as an analog to the related racetam drug 
      levetiracetam (LEV). Both drugs have a similar mechanism of action with a selective 
      and high affinity for binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A, but they may differ in 
      their pharmacological profiles. BRV is approved by Health Canada as adjunctive 
      therapy in the management of partial-onset seizures in adult patients with epilepsy 
      who are not satisfactorily controlled with conventional therapy. A CADTH Common Drug 
      Review (CDR) assessment found that, based on evidence from four multicenter placebo 
      controlled randomized trials, BRV demonstrated significantly greater reductions in 
      seizure frequency compared to placebo. In the absence of head -to head trials, 
      evidence regarding comparative efficacy and safety of BRV versus LEV is limited. An 
      indirect treatment comparison found no statistical differences between LEV and BRV 
      with respect to efficacy and adverse events (AE) - overall and non-behavioral-except 
      dizziness, which occurred at a significantly higher rate with high dose levels of 
      BRV. Behavioral adverse events (BAE) appear to be less prevalent in BRV than with 
      LEV based on evidence from pre-clinical studies and clinical studies.(,)(,) The 
      purpose of this report is to summarize the evidence regarding the comparative 
      clinical safety of BRV compared to LEV among patients with epilepsy with mental 
      health conditions as well as in patients with epilepsy who experienced psychiatric 
      or behavioral adverse events with previous LEV treatment.

TI  - A Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Upadacitinib Versus Tofacitinib in Adults 
      with Moderate-to-Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis.
PG  - 167-181
LID - 10.1007/s40744-020-00257-w [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Upadacitinib and tofacitinib are Janus kinase inhibitors approved for 
      moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the absence of head-to-head trials 
      comparing their effectiveness, this study assessed the efficacy of upadacitinib 
      15 mg once-daily monotherapy/combination therapy against tofacitinib 5 mg 
      twice-daily combination therapy among patients with RA using matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparisons (MAICs). METHODS: The first of two MAICs used individual 
      patient data (IPD) from the 14-week SELECT-MONOTHERAPY trial (upadacitinib [n = 217] 
      vs. methotrexate [n = 216]) and published data from the ORAL Standard trial 
      (tofacitinib + methotrexate [n = 204] vs. methotrexate [n = 108]). The second MAIC 
      used IPD from the 26-week SELECT-COMPARE trial (upadacitinib + methotrexate 
      [n = 647] vs. adalimumab + methotrexate [n = 324]) and published data from ORAL 
      Strategy (tofacitinib + methotrexate [n = 376] vs. adalimumab + methotrexate 
      [n = 386]). Data from patients in the upadacitinib trials were re-weighted based on 
      age, sex, race, swollen joint count 66/28, tender joint count 68/28, C-reactive 
      protein (CRP), and patients' global assessments to match the patient characteristics 
      in tofacitinib trials. After matching, ACR20/50/70 and clinical remission 
      (SDAI[CRP] ≤ 3.3, CDAI ≤ 2.8, DAS28-ESR/CRP < 2.6) were compared for upadacitinib 
      vs. tofacitinib + methotrexate at month 3 and upadacitinib + methotrexate vs. 
      tofacitinib + methotrexate at months 3 and 6 using Wald tests. RESULTS: At month 3, 
      upadacitinib monotherapy patients experienced significantly larger improvement in 
      ACR70 compared to tofacitinib + methotrexate (mean difference in difference [DID]: 
      9.9%; p = 0.019), while upadacitinib + methotrexate was associated with higher ACR50 
      compared to tofacitinib + methotrexate (DID: 12.9%; p = 0.011). At month 6, 
      upadacitinib + methotrexate patients experienced significantly larger improvement in 
      SDAI/CDAI/DAS28-ESR clinical remission compared to tofacitinib + methotrexate, with 
      DIDs of 9.1% (p = 0.011), 7.5% (p = 0.038), and 11.3% (p = 0.002), respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared to tofacitinib combination therapy, treatment with 
      upadacitinib monotherapy and combination therapy were associated with improved 
      outcomes at 3/6 months (monotherapy: ACR70; combination: ACR50, SDAI, CDAI, and 
      DAS28-ESR remission).

TI  - Front-line daratumumab-VTd versus standard-of-care in ASCT-eligible multiple 
      myeloma: matching-adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 143-154
LID - 10.2217/imt-2020-0266 [doi]
AB  - Aim: To compare daratumumab plus standard-of-care (SoC; 
      bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone [VTd]) and VTd alone with other SoC for 
      transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Patients & methods: We 
      conducted an unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison of progression-free 
      and overall survival (PFS/OS) with D-VTd/VTd versus 
      bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone (VRd), 
      bortezomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone (VCd) and bortezomib/dexamethasone (Vd). 
      Results: After matching adjustment, significant improvements in PFS were estimated 
      for D-VTd versus VRd (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.47 [95% CI: 0.33-0.69]), VCd (HR: 0.35 
      [95% CI: 0.21-0.58]) and Vd (HR: 0.42 [95% CI: 0.28-0.63]). OS was significantly 
      longer with D-VTd versus VRd (HR: 0.31 [95% CI: 0.16-0.57]), VCd (HR: 0.35 [95% CI: 
      0.14-0.86]) and Vd (HR: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.18-0.77]). No significant PFS/OS differences 
      were seen for VTd versus other SoC. Conclusion: This analysis supports front-line 
      daratumumab for transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

AB  - The present study evaluated the real-world effectiveness of influenza and 
      pneumococcal dual-vaccination among Chinese elderly, the evidence on which was 
      absent. Outpatient and inpatient claims databases from Jan 1, 2015 to Apr 1, 2017 of 
      persons at least 60 years old in Shenzhen, China were merged with electronic records 
      of influenza vaccines and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPSV23) 
      from Oct 1, 2016 - May 31, 2017. Individuals who were vaccinated with influenza 
      between Nov 1 and Dec 31, 2016 and received PPSV23 30 days within the date of 
      influenza vaccination were defined as the vaccinated group. A control group 
      consisted of individuals that received neither of the vaccines was constructed by 
      matching on year of birth, sex, and district. The two outcomes were all-cause and 
      acute respiratory hospitalizations. Difference-in-difference (DiD) logistic 
      regressions that were proceeded with an entropy balancing (EB) process were used to 
      analyse the effectiveness of dual-vaccination. A total of 48,116 eligible 
      individuals were identified in the vaccinated group, which were matched by 93,692 
      individuals in the control group. The EB-DiD analyses estimated that 
      dual-vaccination was associated with lower short-term risks of all-cause (odds 
      ratio: 0.59, CI: 0.55-0.63) and acute respiratory (odds ratio: 0.49, CI: 0.41-0.59) 
      hospitalizations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite having unquestionable glucose lowering efficacy, current 
      guidelines no more favour the uses of sulphonylureas for CV safety concern, except 
      when cost is an issue. However, formal cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) is not 
      available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an indirect treatment comparison to 
      find the hazard ratio for 3-point MACE, all-cause death, CV death and non-CV death 
      between glimepiride and placebo based on two large CVOTs which established the CV 
      safety of linagliptin (CARMELINA and CAROLINA). RESULTS: Glimepiride was shown to 
      have a non-inferior risk compared to placebo for 3-point MACE (HR 1.04, 95% CI 
      0.850, 1.274), all-cause mortality (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.880, 1.317), CV death (HR 
      0.96, 95% CI 0.732, 1.259), and non-CV death (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.893, 1.733). 
      CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular safety of glimepiride is re-assuring and may help 
      patients with type 2 diabetes world-over to avail the benefit of this affordable 
      efficacious medication.

TI  - Comparative Overall Survival of CDK4/6 Inhibitors Plus Endocrine Therapy vs. 
      Endocrine Therapy Alone for Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic 
      breast cancer.
PG  - 7127-7136
LID - 10.7150/jca.48944 [doi]
AB  - Background: The combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy has greatly 
      improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with hormone receptor-positive, 
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer in 
      many randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, the key issue was the extent to 
      which the benefit in PFS could translate into a prolongation of OS. Methods: We 
      performed a systematical literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane 
      Central Register of Clinical Trials and Embase, as well as meeting online archives 
      up to February 2020. The primary outcome was OS, and we performed indirect treatment 
      comparisons depend on a meta-analysis. Results: Six RCTs were eligible including 
      3421 breast cancer patients. Compared to the endocrine therapy alone group, adding 
      CDK4/6 inhibitors to endocrine therapy had significantly improved OS (HR=0.76, 95% 
      CI=0.68-0.85, P<0.001). Moreover, the OS advantage was consistent in patients with 
      different combined endocrine therapy, endocrine sensitivity status, sites of distant 
      metastasis, menopausal status and age. Nevertheless, more adverse events were 
      observed in patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. The most common grade 3-4 
      adverse events were neutropenia (risk ratio [RR]=37.15, 95% CI=15.33-90.04), 
      leucopenia (RR=25.58, 95% CI=13.23-49.46) and anaemia (RR=2.24, 95% CI=1.38-3.85). 
      Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggested that compared with endocrine therapy alone, 
      the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors significantly improved OS in patients with hormone 
      receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. However, the addition of 
      CDK4/6 inhibitors also increased the incidences of grade 3-4 adverse events.

PG  - 647-663
LID - 10.1007/s11154-020-09608-y [doi]
AB  - The rapid evolution of novel, costly therapies for neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN) 
      warrants formal high-quality cost-effectiveness evaluation. Costs of individual 
      investigations and therapies are high; and examples are presented. We aimed to 
      review the last ten years of standalone health economic evaluations in NEN. 
      Comparing to published standards, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Database of Abstracts of 
      Reviews of Effects (DARE), NHS Economic Evaluation Database and the Health 
      Technology Assessment (HTA) Database were searched for health economic evaluations 
      (HEEs) in NEN published between 2010 and October 2019. Of 12 economic evaluations, 
      11 considered exclusively pharmacological treatment (3 studies of SSAs, 7 studies of 
      sunitinib, everolimus and/or 177Lu-DOTATATE and 1 study of telotristat ethyl) and 1 
      compared surgery with intraarterial therapy. 7 studies of pharmacological treatment 
      had placebo or best supportive care as the only comparator. There remains a paucity 
      of economic evaluations in NEN with the majority industry funded. Most HEEs reviewed 
      did not meet published health economic criteria used to assess quality. Lack of cost 
      data collected from patient populations remains a significant factor in HEEs where 
      clinical expert opinion is still often substituted. Further research utilizing 
      high-quality effectiveness data and rigorous applied health economic analysis is 
      needed.

TI  - Lenalidomide with Rituximab for Previously Treated Follicular Lymphoma and Marginal 
      Zone Lymphoma: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology 
      Appraisal.
PG  - 171-180
LID - 10.1007/s40273-020-00971-x [doi]
AB  - The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
      manufacturer (Celgene) of lenalidomide (Revlimid(®)), as part of the Single 
      Technology Appraisal (STA) process, to submit evidence for the clinical 
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab 
      (MabThera(®)), together referred to as R(2), for the treatment of adults with 
      treated follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Kleijnen 
      Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, 
      was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper 
      summarises the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's critical review on the 
      clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, highlights the key 
      methodological considerations, and describes the development of the NICE guidance by 
      the Appraisal Committee. The CS included one relevant study, for the comparison of 
      R(2) versus rituximab monotherapy (R-mono): the AUGMENT trial. In addition, the 
      company performed an unanchored indirect comparison of R(2) versus rituximab 
      combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) 
      and rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CVP), 
      using data for R(2) from the AUGMENT trial and pooled data for R-CHOP/R-CVP from the 
      Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) database. During the STA process, 
      the company provided an addendum containing evidence on only the FL population, in 
      line with the marketing authorisation obtained at that time, which did not include 
      MZL. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) presented by 
      the company were £27,768 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for R(2) 
      versus R-CHOP, £41,602 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-CVP, and £23,412 per QALY 
      gained for R(2) versus R-mono. The ERG's concerns included the validity of the 
      unanchored comparison, the unavailability of a state transition model to verify the 
      outcomes of the partitioned survival model, substantial uncertainty in survival 
      curves, and potential over-estimation of utility values. The revised ERG base case 
      resulted in ICERs ranging from £16,874 to £44,888 per QALY gained for R(2) versus 
      R-CHOP, from £23,135 to £59,810 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-CVP, and from 
      £18,779 to £27,156 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-mono. Substantial uncertainty 
      remained around these ranges. NICE recommended R(2) within its marketing 
      authorisation, as an option for previously treated FL (grade 1-3A) in adults, 
      contingent on the company providing lenalidomide according to the commercial 
      arrangement.

TI  - Alternative weighting schemes when performing matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparisons.
PG  - 333-346
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1466 [doi]
AB  - Methods for indirect comparisons and network meta-analysis use aggregate level data 
      from multiple studies. A very common, and closely related, scenario is where a 
      company has individual patient data (IPD) from its own trial, but only has published 
      aggregate data from a competitor's trial, and an indirect comparison of the 
      treatments evaluated in these two trials is required. Matching-Adjusted Indirect 
      Comparison (MAIC) has been developed for this situation, where we use the available 
      IPD to adjust for between-trial imbalances in the distributions of observed baseline 
      covariates between the two trials. We extend the current MAIC methodology, where we 
      compute the weights that satisfy the conventional method of moments and result in 
      the largest possible effective sample size (ESS). We show that the approach proposed 
      by Zubizarreta in a previous study can be used for this purpose. We derive a new 
      analytical result that shows why this alternative approach provides a larger ESS 
      than a conventional MAIC. We also derive a new formula for the maximum ESS that can 
      be achieved, even when permitting negative weights, when adjusting for one 
      covariate. This can be used as an easily computed new metric that quantifies the 
      difficulty in adjusting for covariates. What is already known: MAIC is an 
      established way to perform population adjustment in the situation where IPD is 
      available from one trial but only aggregate level data is available from another 
      trial, and an indirect comparison is required. However the effective sample size 
      (ESS) can be small after making the adjustment. What is new: We show that an 
      alternative method can result in a larger ESS. We provide new analytical results 
      showing why this is the case. We derive a new descriptive statistic that is based on 
      maximising the ESS that quantifies the difficulties in adjusting for particular 
      covariates. Potential impact for RSM readers outside the authors' field: Reweighting 
      methods for population adjustment are becoming more commonly used and their 
      implications for research synthesis methodology is now considerable. This paper 
      provides important new links between the theoretical literature, and the more 
      applied research synthesis methodology literature, relating to this topic.

TI  - Immune-related adverse events of a PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy versus a PD-L1 
      inhibitor alone in first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A 
      meta-analysis of randomized control trials.
PG  - 777-786
LID - 10.1002/cncr.33270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The addition of chemotherapy to a programmed death 1/programmed death 
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor is a more effective option as a first-line treatment for 
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It might also inhibit an overactive 
      immune response and thereby reduce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). This 
      meta-analysis assessed the rate of irAEs with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy 
      (I+C) versus a PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone (I) and evaluated the indirect relative risk 
      (RR) of I+C versus I. METHODS: The protocol of this study was registered with 
      PROSPERO (CRD42020139923). The pooled rates of irAEs at different grades were 
      calculated by a single-arm meta-analysis weighted by sample size, and RRs were 
      determined by direct meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: 
      Overall, I+C had a lower rate of grade 3 or higher irAEs than I (7.1% vs 10.6%; 
      indirect RR, 0.516; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.291-0.916), although irAEs of 
      any grade were similar. The rate of pneumonitis with I+C was lower than the rate 
      with I for any grade (5.9% vs 7.1%; indirect RR, 0.217; 95% CI, 0.080-0.588) and for 
      grade 3 or higher. In the endocrine system, I+C was associated with a lower overall 
      ratein comparison with I (16.1% vs 20.1%; indirect RR, 0.260; 95% CI, 0.120-0.564), 
      whereas irAEs of the digestive system were similar with I+C and I. In other systems, 
      I+C decreased the rate of skin reactions, including rash, in comparison with I 
      (10.4% vs 12.9%; indirect RR, 0.474; 95% CI, 0.299-0.751). The rate of grade 3 or 
      higher skin reactions (excluding rash) also decreased with I+C versus I (1.1% vs 
      2.0%) with an indirect RR of 0.158 (95% CI, 0.032-0.765), whereas other included 
      irAEs were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone, a 
      combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of NSCLC decreased the 
      rates of most irAEs, such as pneumonitis and endocrine and skin reactions, and the 
      overall rate. LAY SUMMARY: In the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell 
      lung cancer (NSCLC), the addition of chemotherapy to a programmed death 1/programmed 
      death ligand 1 (PD-(L)1) inhibitor is a more effective option. Adding chemotherapy 
      might reduce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Thus, this article assesses the 
      rate of irAEs with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy (I+C) in comparison with a 
      PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone (I) and evaluates the indirect relative risk (RR) with I+C 
      versus I. The key finding is that in comparison with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone, a 
      combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of NSCLC decreases the 
      rates of most irAEs, such as pneumonitis and endocrine and skin reactions, and the 
      overall rate.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons: Application to time-to-event data.
PG  - 566-577
LID - 10.1002/sim.8789 [doi]
AB  - The Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison method (MAIC) is a recent methodology that 
      allows to perform indirect comparisons between two drugs assessed in two different 
      studies, where individual patients data are available in only one of the two 
      studies, the data of the other one being available in an aggregate format only. In 
      this work, we have assessed the properties of the MAIC method and compared, through 
      simulations, several ways of practical implementation of the method. We conclude 
      that it is more efficient to match the treatment arms separately (match the two 
      drugs to compare on one hand, and the control arms on the other hand) and use the 
      Lasso technique to select the covariates for the matching step is better than 
      matching a maximal set of covariates.

AB  - Aim: To compare the efficacy of ofatumumab to other disease-modifying therapies 
      (DMTs) for relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Materials & methods: A network 
      meta-analysis was conducted to determine the relative effect of ofatumumab on 
      annualized relapse rate and confirmed disability progression at 3 months and 
      6 months. Results: For each outcome, ofatumumab was as effective as other highly 
      efficacious monoclonal antibody DMTs (i.e., alemtuzumab, natalizumab and 
      ocrelizumab). Conclusion: Ofatumumab offers beneficial outcomes for RMS by reducing 
      relapse and disability progression risk.

AB  - Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAIC) is a nontuberculous opportunistic 
      infection in immunocompromised patients. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract 
      (GIT) is usually part of a disseminated disease in AIDS patients with a low CD4 
      count, however with standard antiretroviral therapy (ART), a localized presentation 
      is more likely. It can affect any part of the GIT, mostly the duodenum and typically 
      as patches. Incomplete or refractory ART for HIV-strains, therapy-related side 
      effects, noncompliant or incomplete treatment to previous MAIC infections, 
      superimposed complications and comorbid opportunistic infections may result in 
      atypical clinical, endoscopic and histopathologic manifestations. We performed a 
      retrospective review study retrieving cases of MAIC in duodenal endoscopic biopsy. 
      We found five cases of MAIC in HIV/AIDS patients. They were males with an average 
      age of 40-years. They showed different histopathologic features, variable patterns 
      of MAIC-histiocytic infiltrates, and varying intensity of intracellular acid-fast 
      positive bacilli. Enterocytes vacuolization and transepithelial elimination were 
      also observed. Three cases were associated with cytomegalovirus and cryptococcal 
      infections. A case was complicated by lymphangiectasia-associated protein-losing 
      enteropathy. Initially, three cases were morphologically missed. Ziehl-Neelsen stain 
      helped reach the correct diagnosis. Pathologists have an important role in patients' 
      management by guiding clinicians to the correct diagnosis. Pathologists should be 
      aware of these different histopathologic manifestations, their potential pitfalls, 
      look for certain helpful clues complemented with multiple levels and special stains. 
      In particular, AFB stains are mandatory in all mucosal biopsy specimens from 
      HIV/AIDS patients regardless of their appearances.

TI  - Daratumumab Plus Bortezomib, Melphalan, and Prednisone Versus Standard of Care in 
      Latin America for Transplant-Ineligible Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma: Propensity 
      Score Matching Analysis.
PG  - 4996-5009
LID - 10.1007/s12325-020-01521-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The phase 3 ALCYONE study demonstrated significantly longer 
      progression-free and overall survival (PFS/OS) and higher overall response rates 
      (ORR) with daratumumab plus bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) versus VMP 
      alone in transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
      (NDMM). In Latin America, bortezomib- or thalidomide-based regimens remain standard 
      of care (SoC) for this population. No head-to-head trials have compared D-VMP with 
      SoC regimens used in Latin America. METHODS: Propensity score matching (PSM) was 
      used to control for baseline differences between patient populations and compare 
      outcomes for D-VMP versus SoC regimens used in Latin America. Data for the D-VMP 
      cohort were from the D-VMP arm of the ALCYONE trial (n = 350). Data for the SoC 
      cohort were from the retrospective, observational Hemato-Oncology Latin America 
      (HOLA) study, which included patients with NDMM who did not receive a transplant 
      (n = 729). Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression. Exact, 
      optimal, and nearest-neighbor PSM were applied to pick the best-performing method. 
      Doubly robust estimation was the base case, since some baseline imbalances 
      persisted. RESULTS: All 350 patients from the D-VMP arm of ALCYONE were included in 
      OS/PFS analyses and 338 in ORR analysis; 478 and 324 patients, respectively, from 
      HOLA were included in these analyses. Naïve comparison revealed important 
      differences in baseline characteristics (age, chronic kidney disease, hypercalcemia, 
      and International Staging System [ISS] stage). After nearest-neighbor matching, 
      baseline characteristics, except ISS stage, were well balanced; comparisons favored 
      D-VMP over SoC for OS (hazard ratio = 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.66; 
      P = 0.002) and PFS (hazard ratio = 0.48; 95% CI 0.35-0.67; P < 0.001). After exact 
      matching, imbalances remained in age and ISS stage; comparisons favored D-VMP over 
      SoC for ORR (odds ratio = 5.44; 95% CI 2.65-11.82; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In 
      transplant-ineligible patients with NDMM, D-VMP showed superior effectiveness versus 
      bortezomib- and thalidomide-based regimens, supporting adoption of 
      daratumumab-containing regimens in Latin America.

TI  - Impact of Patient Characteristics on Treatment Outcomes in Symptomatic Venous 
      Thromboembolism: Results of HOKUSAI-VTE Randomized Trial Analysis.
PG  - e245-e254
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1716496 [doi]
AB  - Introduction  In patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) such as edoxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban are 
      more convenient, safer, and just as effective as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). 
      Limited information is known about the effects of patient characteristics on VTE 
      efficacy and safety of DOACs compared with VKAs, without appropriate effect modifier 
      adjustment comparisons of DOACs may be biased. This study considers the effect of 
      variables that can modify the efficacy and safety of edoxaban and warfarin, using 
      patient-level data. Materials and Methods  The primary efficacy and safety outcomes 
      in the HOKUSAI-VTE study were VTE recurrence and clinically relevant bleeding, 
      respectively. Potential effect modifiers were age, creatinine clearance, and weight. 
      The relationship between the percentage of time in international normalized ratio 
      (INR) control and outcomes were considered for the warfarin arm. Univariate and 
      multivariate regression were performed for each patient characteristic. Results  The 
      relationship between treatment and VTE recurrence differed by age (interaction p 
       = 0.007) and by creatinine clearance ( p  = 0.05). VTE recurrence differed by age 
      for patients in the warfarin arm but not for those in the edoxaban arm and differed 
      by INR control in the warfarin arm ( p  < 0.005). A stronger relationship between 
      creatinine clearance and clinically relevant bleeding was found in the warfarin arm 
      than in the edoxaban arm ( p  = 0.04). Clinically relevant bleeding differed by the 
      percentage of time in INR control in the warfarin arm ( p  < 0.005). Age appeared to 
      be a more important effect modifier than creatinine clearance in patients with VTE. 
      Discussion  The finding that efficacy in older patients was greater for those taking 
      edoxaban than for those taking warfarin in the HOKUSAI-VTE study needs further 
      investigation. Modification of the treatment effect by age for those taking warfarin 
      might bias estimates of comparative effectiveness among DOACs if VKAs are the 
      reference treatment.

AB  - Aim: To estimate the comparative efficacy of cemiplimab, a programmed cell death 
      protein 1 inhibitor, versus EGFR inhibitors, pembrolizumab and platinum-based 
      chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival. 
      Patients & methods: We performed an indirect treatment comparison of cemiplimab and 
      other available systemic therapies for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous 
      cell carcinoma. Results: Cemiplimab was associated with benefits in OS (hazard 
      ratios range: 0.07-0.52) and progression-free survival (hazard ratios range: 
      0.30-0.67) versus EGFR inhibitors and pembrolizumab (data from KEYNOTE-629). 
      Cemiplimab was more efficacious versus platinum-based chemotherapy in terms of OS. 
      Conclusion: Cemiplimab may offer improvements in survival for advanced cutaneous 
      squamous cell carcinoma patients compared with existing systemic therapies.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Different Doses of Systemic Corticosteroids in COPD 
      Exacerbation.
PG  - 316-326
LID - 10.4187/respcare.07925 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although systemic corticosteroids (SCS) have long been used to treat 
      patients with COPD exacerbation, the recommended dose remains controversial. We 
      aimed to perform a meta-analysis and an indirect treatment comparison to investigate 
      the efficacy and safety of different doses of SCS in subjects with COPD 
      exacerbation. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching different databases for 
      randomized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy and safety of SCS with 
      placebo in subjects with exacerbation of COPD. The different doses of SCS were 
      assigned to low-dose (ie, initial dose ≤ 40 mg prednisone equivalent/d [PE/d]), 
      medium-dose (initial dose = 40-100 mg PE/d, and high-dose (initial dose > 100 mg 
      PE/d) groups. The indirect treatment comparison was performed between low-, medium-, 
      and high-dose SCS groups. RESULTS: Twelve trials with 1,375 participates were 
      included. Compared to placebo, the risk of treatment failure was lower in the 
      low-dose SCS groups (risk ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.43-0.88], P = .007) and high-dose SCS 
      groups (risk ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.48-0.85], P = .002); the FEV(1) was significantly 
      improved in low-dose (mean difference 0.09 [95% CI 0.06-0.12], P < .001), 
      medium-dose (mean difference 0.23 [95% CI 0.02-0.44], P = .036), and high-dose SCS 
      groups (mean difference 0.09, [95% CI 0.03-0.15], P < .001, respectively). Regarding 
      safety, the incidence of hyperglycemia was higher in high-dose SCS groups versus 
      placebo (risk ratio 2.52 [95% CI 1.13-5.62], P = .02). The indirect comparison 
      between low-, medium-, and high-dose SCS found that the risk of treatment failure 
      and changes in FEV(1) were similar between these doses of SCS. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      meta-analysis indicates that low-dose SCS (initial dose ≤ 40 mg PE/d) was sufficient 
      and safer for treating subjects with COPD exacerbation, and it was noninferior to 
      higher doses of SCS (initial dose > 40 mg PE/d) in improving FEV(1) and reducing the 
      risk of treatment failure. However, our findings need to be verified in head-to-head 
      randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Cochrane Neonatal was first established in 1993, as one of the original review 
      groups of the Cochrane Collaboration. In fact, the origins of Cochrane Neonatal 
      precede the establishment of the collaboration. In the 1980's, the National 
      Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at Oxford, led by Dr. Iain Chalmers, established the 
      "Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials" (ODPT), a register of virtually all randomized 
      controlled trials in perinatal medicine to provide a resource for reviews of the 
      safety and efficacy of interventions used in perinatal care and to foster 
      cooperative and coordinated research efforts in the perinatal field [1]. An effort 
      that was clearly ahead of its time, ODPT comprised four main elements: a register of 
      published reports of trials; a register of unpublished trials; a register of ongoing 
      and planned trials; and data derived from pooled overviews (meta-analyses) of 
      trials. This core effort grew into the creation of the seminal books, "Effective 
      Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth" as well as "Effective Care of the Newborn Infant" 
      [2,3]. As these efforts in perinatal medicine grew, Iain Chalmers thought well 
      beyond perinatal medicine into the creation of a worldwide collaboration that became 
      Cochrane [4]. The mission of the Cochrane Collaboration is to promote 
      evidence-informed health decision-making by producing high-quality, relevant, 
      accessible systematic reviews and other synthesized research evidence 
      (www.cochrane.org). Cochrane Neonatal has continued to be one of the most productive 
      review groups, publishing between 25 tpo to 40 new or updated systematic reviews 
      each year. The impact factor has been steadily increasing over four years and now 
      rivals most of the elite journals in pediatric medicine. Cochrane Neonatal has been 
      a worldwide effort. Currently, there are 404 reviews involving 1206 authors from 52 
      countries. What has Cochrane done for babies? Reviews from Cochrane Neonatal have 
      informed guidelines and recommendations worldwide. From January 2018 through June 
      2020, 77 international guidelines cited 221 Cochrane Neonatal reviews. These 
      recommendations have included recommendations of the use of postnatal steroids, 
      inhaled nitric oxide, feeding guidelines for preterm infants and other core aspects 
      of neonatal practice. In addition, Cochrane Reviews has been the impetus for 
      important research, including the large-scale trial of prophylactic indomethacin 
      therapy, a variety of trials of postnatal steroids, trials of emollient ointment and 
      probiotic trials [6]. While justifiably proud of these accomplishments, one needs to 
      examine the future contribution of Cochrane Neonatal to the neonatal community. The 
      future of Cochrane Neonatal is inexorably linked to the future of neonatal research. 
      Obviously, there is no synthesis of trials data if, as a community, we fail to 
      provide the core substrate for that research. As we look at the current trials' 
      environment, fewer randomized controlled trial related to neonates are being 
      published in recent years. A simple search of PubMed, limiting the search to 
      "neonates" and "randomized controlled trials" shows that in the year 2000, 321 
      randomized controlled trials were published. These peaked five years ago, in 2015, 
      with close to 900 trials being published. However, in 2018, only 791 studies are 
      identified. Does this decrease represent a meaningful change in the neonatal 
      research environment? Quite possibly. There are shifting missions of clinical 
      neonatology at academic medical institutions, at least in the United States, with a 
      focus on business aspects as well as other important competing clinical activities. 
      Quality improvement has taken over as one of the major activities at both private 
      and academic neonatal practices. Clearly, this is a needed improvement. All units at 
      levels need to be dedicated to improving the outcomes of the sick and fragile 
      population we care for. However, this need not be at the expense of formal clinical 
      trials. It is understandable that this approach would be taken. Newer interventions 
      frequently relate to complex systems of care and not the simple single 
      interventions. Even trials that might traditionally have been done as randomized 
      controlled trials, such as the introduction of a new mode of ventilation, are in 
      reality complex challenges to the ability of institutions to create systems to adapt 
      to these new technologies. Cost of doing trials has always been a barrier. The 
      challenging regulatory and ethical environment contributes to these problems as well 
      [7]. Despite these barriers, how does the research agenda of the neonatal community 
      move forward in the 21st Century? We need to reassess how we create and disseminate 
      our research findings. Innovative trial designs will allow us to address complex 
      issues that we may not have tackled with conventional trials. Adaptive designs may 
      allow us to look at potentially life-saving therapies in a way that feel more 
      efficient and more ethical [8]. Clarifying issues such as the use of inhaled nitric 
      oxide in preterm infants would be greatly served if we even knew whether or not 
      there are hypoxemic preterm infant who would benefit from this therapy [9]. Current 
      trials do not suggest so, yet current practice tells us that a significant number of 
      these babies will receive inhaled nitric oxide [10-13]. Adaptive design, such as 
      those done with trials of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), would allow us 
      to quickly assess whether, in fact, these therapies are life-saving and allow us to 
      consider whether or not further trials are needed [14,15]. Our understanding that 
      many interventions involve entire systems approaches does not relegate us only to 
      doing quality improvement work. Cluster designs may allow us to test more complex 
      interventions that have usually been under the purview of quality improvement 
      [16-18]. Cluster trials are well suited for such investigations and can be done with 
      the least interruption to ongoing care. Ultimately, quality improvement is the 
      application of the best evidence available (evidence-based medicine is "what to do" 
      and evidence-based practice is "how to do"). [19,20]. Nascent efforts, such as the 
      statement on "embedding necessary research into culture and health" (the ENRICH 
      statement) call for the conduct of large, efficient pragmatic trials to evaluate 
      neonatal outcomes, as in part called for in the ALPHA Collaboration [21,22]. This 
      statement envisions an international system to identify important research questions 
      by consulting regularly with all stakeholders, including patients, public health 
      professionals, researchers, providers, policy makers, regulators, funders of 
      industry. The ENRICH statement envisions a pathway to enable individuals, 
      educational institutions, hospitals and health-care facilities to confirm their 
      status as research-friendly by integrating an understanding of trials, other 
      research and critical thinking and to teaching learning and culture, as well as an 
      engagement with funders, professional organizations and regulatory bodies and other 
      stake holders to raise awareness of the value of efficient international research to 
      reduce barriers to large international pragmatic trials and other collaborative 
      studies. In the future, if trials are to be done on this scale or trials are 
      prospectively designed to be analyzed together, core outcome measures must be 
      identified and standardized. That clinical trials supply estimates of outcomes that 
      are relevant to patients and their families is critical. In addition, current 
      neonatal research evaluates many different outcomes using multiple measures. A given 
      measure can have multiple widely used definitions. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (or 
      chronic lung disease just to add to the confusion) quickly comes to mind [23,24]. 
      The use of multiple definitions when attempting to measure the same outcome prevents 
      synthesis of trial results and meta-analysis and hinders efforts to refine our 
      estimates of effects. Towards that end, Webbe and colleagues have set out to develop 
      a core outcome set for neonatal research [25]. Key stakeholders in the neonatal 
      community reviewed multiple outcomes reported in neonatal trials and qualitative 
      studies. Based on consensus, key outcome measures were identified, including 
      survival, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain injury on imaging, retinopathy or 
      prematurity, gross motor ability, general cognitive ability, quality of life, 
      adverse events, visual impairment or blindness, hearing impairment or deafness, 
      chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Trials registration has to be a 
      continued focus of the neonatal community. Trials registration allows for systematic 
      reviewers to understand whether or not reporting bias has occurred [26]. It also 
      allows for transparent incorporation of these core outcome measures. Ultimately, 
      trials registration should include public reporting of all of these core outcomes 
      and, in the future, access to data on an individual level such that more 
      sophisticated individual patient data meta-analysis could occur. Lastly, there is no 
      reason to see clinical trials and quality improvement as separate or exclusive 
      activities. In fact, in the first NICQ Collaborative, conducted by Vermont Oxford 
      Network, participation in a trial of postnatal steroids was considered part of the 
      quality improvement best practices as opposed to simply choosing an as-of-yet 
      unproven approach to use of this potent drug [27]. What role will Cochrane Neonatal 
      play as we move forward in the 21st Century? As the neonatal community moves forward 
      with its' research agenda, Cochrane Neonatal must not only follow but also lead with 
      innovative approaches to synthesizing research findings. Cochrane Neonatal must 
      continue to work closely with guideline developers. The relationship between 
      systematic review production and guideline development is clearly outlined in 
      reports from the Institute of Medicine [28,29]. Both are essential to guideline 
      development; the systematic review group culling the evidence for the benefits and 
      harms of a given intervention and the guideline group addressing the contextual 
      issues of cost, feasibility, implementation and the values and preferences of 
      individuals and societies. Most national and international guidelines groups now 
      routinely use systematic reviews as the evidence basis for their guidelines and 
      recommendations. Examples of the partnership between Cochrane Neonatal and 
      international guideline development can be seen in our support of the World Health 
      Organization (WHO) guidelines on the use of vitamin A or the soon to be published 
      recommendations from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) on 
      cord management in preterm and term infants [30]. In the future, we need to 
      collaborate early in the guideline development process so that the reviews are fit 
      for purpose and meet the needs of the guideline developers and the end users. 
      Towards this end, all Cochrane Neonatal reviews now contain GRADE assessments of the 
      key clinical findings reported in the systematic review [31]. Addition of these 
      assessments addresses the critical issue of our confidence in the findings. We are 
      most confident in evidence provided by randomized controlled trials but this 
      assessment can be can be downgraded if the studies that reported on the outcome in 
      question had a high risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency of results, or 
      imprecision, or where there is evidence of reporting bias. Information provided by 
      GRADE assessments is seen as critical in the process of moving from the evidence to 
      formal recommendations [32]. We need to explore complex reviews, such as network 
      (NMA) or multiple treatment comparison (MCT) meta-analyses, to address issues not 
      formally addressed in clinical trials [33]. In conditions where there are multiple 
      effective interventions, it is rare for all possible interventions to have been 
      tested against each other [34]. A solution could be provided by network 
      meta-analysis, which allows for comparing all treatments with each other, even if 
      randomized controlled trials are not available for some treatment comparisons [34]. 
      Network meta-analysis uses both direct (head-to-head) randomized clinical trial 
      (RCT) evidence as well as indirect evidence from RCTs to compare the relative 
      effectiveness of all included interventions [35]. However, Mills and colleagues note 
      that the methodological quality of MTCs may be difficult for clinicians to interpret 
      because the number of interventions evaluated may be large and the methodological 
      approaches may be complex [35]. Cochrane Neonatal must take a role in both the 
      creation of such analyses and the education of the neonatal community regarding the 
      pitfalls of such an approach. The availability of individual patient data will make 
      more sophisticated analyses more available to the community. Although the current 
      crop of individual patient data meta-analyses (including the reviews of elective 
      high frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide and oxygen targets) have not 
      differed substantially from the findings of the trials level reviews (suggesting 
      that, in fact, sick neonates are more alike that unalike), there still will be a 
      large role for individual patient data meta-analysis, at least to end the unfound 
      conclusions that these therapies are effective in various subgroups (be it issues of 
      sex, disease severity, or clinical setting) [36-39]. Future trials should take a 
      lesson from the NeOProM Collaborative [37,39]. Given the difficulty in generating 
      significant sample size and creating funding in any single environment, trials with 
      similar protocols should be conducted in a variety of healthcare settings with an 
      eye towards both study level and individual patient level meta-analysis at the 
      conclusion of those trials, allowing for broader contribution to the trials data, 
      more rapid accrual of sample size, and more precise results. We need to educate the 
      neonatal community regarding the use and abuse of diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests 
      are a critical component of healthcare but also contribute greatly to the cost of 
      medical care worldwide. These costs include the cost of the tests themselves and the 
      costs of misdiagnosis and treatment of individuals who will not benefit from those 
      treatments. Clinicians may have a limited understanding of diagnostic test accuracy, 
      the ability of a diagnostic test to distinguish between patients with and without 
      the disease or target condition [41,42]. Efforts such as Choosing Wisely have tried 
      to identify these deficiencies [40]. As Cochrane has increased the general literacy 
      of both the medical and general population regarding the interpretation of the 
      results of interventions on various diseases, so should Cochrane move forward and 
      improve the understanding of diagnostic testing. We need to become more efficient at 
      creating and maintaining our reviews. The time spent to produce systematic reviews 
      is far too great. In average, it takes between 2½ to 6½ years to produce a 
      systematic review, requiring intense time input for highly trained and expensive 
      experts. Innovations in the ways in which we produce systematic reviews can make the 
      review process more efficient by outsourcing some of the tasks or crowdsourcing to 
      machine learning. We need to let the crowd and machine learning innovations help us 
      sort the massive amounts of information needed to conduct systematic reviews. It can 
      also allow for "live" updating of critical reviews where the research landscape is 
      quickly changing [43]. Lastly, Cochrane Neonatal must focus more on users of the 
      reviews and not necessarily authors of the reviews. Current Cochrane programming 
      speaks of Cochrane training with an eye towards developing the skills of individuals 
      who will conduct systematic reviews. While this is clearly needed and laudable, the 
      fact of the matter is that most of the community will be "users" of the reviews. 
      Individuals who need to understand how to use and interpret the findings of 
      systematic reviews. These review users include clinicians, guideline developers,

      in adding transparency to the level of uncertainty we have in our findings. From a

      misunderstanding of scientific evidence and how we convey what we know, and our 
      uncertainty about what we know, to parents and families.

      comparisons: A simulation study.
PG  - 4885-4911
LID - 10.1002/sim.8759 [doi]
AB  - Standard network meta-analysis and indirect comparisons combine aggregate data from 
      multiple studies on treatments of interest, assuming that any factors that interact 
      with treatment effects (effect modifiers) are balanced across populations. 
      Population adjustment methods such as multilevel network meta-regression (ML-NMR), 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), and simulated treatment comparison 
      (STC) relax this assumption using individual patient data from one or more studies, 
      and are becoming increasingly prevalent in health technology appraisals and the 
      applied literature. Motivated by an applied example and two recent reviews of 
      applications, we undertook an extensive simulation study to assess the performance 
      of these methods in a range of scenarios under various failures of assumptions. We 
      investigated the impact of varying sample size, missing effect modifiers, strength 
      of effect modification and validity of the shared effect modifier assumption, 
      validity of extrapolation and varying between-study overlap, and different covariate 
      distributions and correlations. ML-NMR and STC performed similarly, eliminating bias 
      when the requisite assumptions were met. Serious concerns are raised for MAIC, which 
      performed poorly in nearly all simulation scenarios and may even increase bias 
      compared with standard indirect comparisons. All methods incur bias when an effect 
      modifier is missing, highlighting the necessity of careful selection of potential 
      effect modifiers prior to analysis. When all effect modifiers are included, ML-NMR 
      and STC are robust techniques for population adjustment. ML-NMR offers additional 
      advantages over MAIC and STC, including extending to larger treatment networks and 
      producing estimates in any target population, making this an attractive choice in a 
      variety of scenarios.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Novel treatment options are needed to improve outcomes in 
      transplant-ineligible relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
      (DLBCL). This systematic literature review evaluated clinical evidence on treatments 
      for patients with R/R DLBCL ineligible for, or relapsed following, stem cell 
      transplantation. METHODS: We assessed the feasibility of conducting an indirect 
      treatment comparison (ITC) or network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the relative 
      efficacy and safety of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with 
      bendamustine + rituximab versus other relevant treatments. RESULTS: Thirty-seven 
      studies were identified, of which 20 were eligible [seven randomized, controlled 
      trials (RCTs); 13 observational/single-arm trials]. Due to a lack of RCTs, an 
      ITC/NMA summary of the relative efficacy and safety of the treatment options was not 
      possible. Only two of the seven RCTs had positive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings highlight the paucity of published RCTs to establish the comparative 
      efficacy of treatments for transplant-ineligible R/R DLBCL and lack of standard of 
      care in this setting.

BTI - Pharmacoeconomic Report: Eculizumab (Soliris): Alexion Pharma Canada Corp: 
      Indication: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder
AB  - CADTH’s findings remained aligned with the sponsor’s: the addition of eculizumab to 
      standard of care (SOC) is not a cost-effective option at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
      threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). CADTH accounted for some 
      limitations, including changing the model’s relapse definition, selecting an 
      alternate parametric distribution for time to first relapse, assuming lifelong 
      treatment, capturing costs associated with administration and vaccination, and 
      assuming eculizumab would be administered in outpatient clinics. In CADTH’s base 
      case, eculizumab plus SOC was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratio (ICER) of $1,508,152 per QALY gained compared with SOC alone in neuromyelitis 
      optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody 
      positive. A price reduction of 96% would be required for eculizumab plus SOC to 
      achieve an ICER below a WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY. The results of CADTH’s 
      reanalysis are highly dependent on the treatment effects of eculizumab plus SOC 
      compared to SOC alone. Several limitations were associated with the PREVENT trial 
      (e.g., the absence of relevant outcomes related to subsequent relapses after the 
      first relapse; high rates of major protocol deviation) that could not be addressed 
      by CADTH. In the submitted model, the majority of the incremental clinical benefits 
      were found to occur beyond the trial observed period; there is high uncertainty 
      associated with this extrapolation. The cost-effectiveness of eculizumab compared to 
      rituximab, mitoxantrone, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is unknown in the 
      absence of both direct and indirect treatment comparisons. Interpretation of the 
      economic results therefore warrants careful consideration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the performance of 
      a time-to-event data reconstruction method, to assess the bias and efficiency of 
      unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) methods for the analysis of 
      time-to-event outcomes, and to propose an approach to adjust the bias of unanchored 
      MAIC when omitted confounders across trials may exist. METHODS: To evaluate the 
      methods using a Monte Carlo approach, a thousand repetitions of simulated data sets 
      were generated for two single-arm trials. In each repetition, researchers were 
      assumed to have access to individual-level patient data (IPD) for one of the trials 
      and the published Kaplan-Meier curve of another. First, we compared the raw data and 
      the reconstructed IPD using Cox regressions to determine the performance of the data 
      reconstruction method. Then, we evaluated alternative unanchored MAIC strategies 
      with varying completeness of covariates for matching in terms of bias, efficiency, 
      and confidence interval coverage. Finally, we proposed a bias factor-adjusted 
      approach to gauge the true effects when unanchored MAIC estimates might be biased 
      due to omitted variables. RESULTS: Reconstructed data sufficiently represented raw 
      data in the sense that the difference between the raw and reconstructed data was not 
      statistically significant over the one thousand repetitions. Also, the bias of 
      unanchored MAIC estimates ranged from minimal to substantial as the set of 
      covariates became less complete. More, the confidence interval estimates of 
      unanchored MAIC were suboptimal even using the complete set of covariates. Finally, 
      the bias factor-adjusted method we proposed substantially reduced omitted variable 
      bias. CONCLUSIONS: Unanchored MAIC should be used to analyze time-to-event outcomes 
      with caution. The bias factor may be used to gauge the true treatment effect.

AB  - Limited information is available on the efficacy of front-line bendamustine and 
      rituximab (BR) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with reduced renal function or 
      coexisting conditions. We therefore analyzed a cohort of real-world patients and 
      performed a matched adjusted indirect comparison with a cohort of patients treated 
      with ibrutinib. One hundred and fifty-seven patients with creatinine clearance 
      (CrCl) <70 mL/min and/or CIRS score >6 were treated with BR. The median age was 
      72 years; 69% of patients had ≥2 comorbidities and the median CrCl was 59.8 mL/min. 
      17.6% of patients carried TP53 disruption. The median progression-free survival 
      (PFS) was 45 months; TP53 disruption was associated with a shorter PFS (P = 0.05). 
      The overall survival (OS) at 12, 24, and 36 months was 96.2%, 90.1%, and 79.5%, 
      respectively. TP53 disruption was associated with an increased risk of death 
      (P = 0.01). Data on 162 patients ≥65 years treated with ibrutinib were analyzed and 
      compared with 165 patients ≥65 years treated with BR. Factors predicting for a 
      longer PFS at multivariable analysis in the total patient population treated with BR 
      and ibrutinib were age (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10, P < 0.01) and treatment with 
      ibrutinib (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.93, P = 0.03). In a post hoc analysis of patients 
      in advanced stage, a significant PFS advantage was observed in patient who had 
      received ibrutinib (P = 0.03), who showed a trend for OS advantage (P = 0.08). We 
      arrived at the following conclusions: (a) BR is a relatively effective first-line 
      regimen in a real-world population of unfit patients without TP53 disruption, (b) 
      ibrutinib provided longer disease control than BR in patients with advanced disease 
      stage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials remain the 
      standard way to evaluate drugs for efficacy, historical data are used extensively 
      across the development cycle. This ranges from supplementing contemporary data to 
      increase the power of trials to cross-trial comparisons in estimating comparative 
      efficacy. In many cases, these approaches are performed without in-depth review of 
      the context of data, which may lead to bias and incorrect conclusions. METHODS: We 
      discuss the original 'Pocock' criteria for the use of historical data and how the 
      use of historical data has evolved over time. Based on these factors and personal 
      experience, we created a series of questions that may be asked of historical data, 
      prior to their use. Based on the answers to these questions, various statistical 
      approaches are recommended. The strategy is illustrated with a case study in 
      colorectal cancer. RESULTS: A number of areas need to be considered with historical 
      data, which we split into three categories: outcome measurement, study/patient 
      characteristics (including setting and inclusion/exclusion criteria), and disease 
      process/intervention effects. Each of these areas may introduce issues if not 
      appropriately handled, while some may preclude the use of historical data entirely. 
      We present a tool (in the form of a table) for highlighting any such issues. 
      Application of the tool to a colorectal cancer data set demonstrates under what 
      conditions historical data could be used and what the limitations of such an 
      analysis would be. CONCLUSION: Historical data can be a powerful tool to augment or 
      compare with contemporary trial data, though caution is required. We present some of 
      the issues that may be considered when involving historical data and what (if any) 
      statistical approaches may account for differences between studies. We recommend 
      that, where historical data are to be used in analyses, potential differences 
      between studies are addressed explicitly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment options for intractable metastatic colorectal cancer 
      include regorafenib, trifluridine/tipiracil, and fruquintinib. In this study, we 
      aimed to conduct a network meta-analysis for comparing the efficacy of these agents. 
      METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials, and ClinicalTrials databases for relevant literature, up to February 2020. 
      The data were collected from randomized controlled trials on regorafenib, 
      trifluridine/tipiracil, or fruquintinib, administered to patients with metastatic 
      colorectal cancer who failed on treatment with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, or 
      fluoropyrimidine. The primary end points, namely, the overall survival and 
      progression-free survival, were analyzed for subsequent network analysis using the 
      Review Manager and Aggregate Data Drug Information System software for performing 
      direct and indirect comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 7 trials were analyzed in this 
      study. Trifluridine/tipiracil and regorafenib proved to be superior to the placebo, 
      with respect to the overall survival (odds ratio: 0.38, 95% confidence interval: 
      0.27-0.52 for trifluridine/tipiracil; odds ratio: 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 
      0.26-0.84 for regorafenib) and progression-free survival (odds ratio: 0.18, 95% 
      confidence interval: 0.05-0.67 for trifluridine/tipiracil; odds ratio: 0.06, 95% 
      confidence interval: 0.04-0.09 for regorafenib). Regorafenib (80 mg) was superior to 
      the placebo in terms of the overall survival and progression-free survival and 
      inferior to trifluridine/tipiracil and fruquintinib. Network analysis revealed that 
      the efficacy of trifluridine/tipiracil and fruquintinib was fundamentally similar, 
      and both the agents were superior to regorafenib. CONCLUSION: Regorafenib (80 mg) 
      was superior to the placebo, but inferior to 160 mg regorafenib, 
      trifluridine/tipiracil, and fruquintinib. This study further revealed that the 
      efficiency of trifluridine/tipiracil and fruquintinib is identical, but their 
      toxicity profiles are different.

TI  - Indirect treatment comparison of the efficacy of patisiran and inotersen for 
      hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.
PG  - 121-129
LID - 10.1080/14656566.2020.1811850 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patisiran and inotersen are two therapies approved for the treatment 
      of hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, a 
      rapidly progressive disease with a substantial clinical burden. This analysis 
      indirectly compares the efficacy of patisiran and inotersen on neuropathy and 
      quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Published results from the NEURO-TTR study of 
      inotersen and individual patient data from the APOLLO study of patisiran were used. 
      Indirect comparisons were conducted for 15-month changes in neuropathy and QOL 
      endpoints: modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7(Ionis,)), Norfolk Quality 
      of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) questionnaire, body mass index (BMI), 
      and Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score. Analyses were conducted under different 
      assumptions about the impact of missing data and to adjust for baseline differences 
      between studies. RESULTS: Patisiran showed significantly greater treatment effects 
      than inotersen for mNIS+7(Ionis) (mean difference: -12.3 [95% confidence interval: 
      -21.4, -3.3]), Norfolk QOL-DN (-11.3 [-19.8, -2.9]), and BMI (1.0 [0.4, 1.7]). The 
      proportion of patients with improvement or no change from baseline on PND score was 
      higher for patisiran-treated patients (odds ratio: 8.9 [4.6, 17.5]). Results were 
      consistent and robust across analyses and methods. CONCLUSIONS: Patisiran 
      demonstrated greater treatment effects on neuropathy and QOL than inotersen in 
      patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: a 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - 4305-4314

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several interventions with variable efficacy are available as first-line 
      therapy for patients with achalasia. We assessed the comparative efficacy of 
      different strategies for management of achalasia, through a network meta-analysis 
      combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: We identified six 
      randomized controlled trials in adults with achalasia that compared the efficacy of 
      pneumatic dilation (PD; n = 260), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM; n = 309), and 
      peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM; n = 176). Primary efficacy outcome was 1-year 
      treatment success (patient-reported improvement in symptoms based on validated 
      scores); secondary efficacy outcomes were 2-year treatment success and physiologic 
      improvement; safety outcomes were risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 
      severe erosive esophagitis, and procedure-related serious adverse events. We 
      performed pairwise and network meta-analysis for all treatments, and used GRADE 
      criteria to appraise quality of evidence. RESULTS: Low-quality evidence, based 
      primarily on direct evidence, supports the use of POEM (RR [risk ratio], 1.29; 95% 
      confidence intervals [CI], 0.99-1.69), and LHM (RR, 1.18 [0.96-1.44]) over PD for 
      treatment success at 1 year; no significant difference was observed between LHM and 
      POEM (RR 1.09 [0.86-1.39]). The incidence of severe esophagitis after POEM, LHM, and 
      PD was 5.3%, 3.7%, and 1.5%, respectively. Procedure-related serious adverse event 
      rate after POEM, LHM, and PD was 1.4%, 6.7%, and 4.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      POEM and LHM have comparable efficacy, and may increase treatment success as 
      compared to PD with low confidence in estimates. POEM may have lower rate of serious 
      adverse events compared to LHM and PD, but higher rate of GERD.

TI  - Practical considerations of utilizing propensity score methods in clinical 
      development using real-world and historical data.
PG  - 106123

AB  - In recent years, with the rapid increase in the volume and accessibility of 
      Real-World-Data (RWD) and Real-World-Evidence (RWE), we have seen the unprecedented 
      opportunities for their use in drug clinical development and life-cycle management. 
      RWD and RWE have demonstrated the significant potential to improve the design, 
      planning, and execution of clinical development. Furthermore, they can feature in 
      the designs as either a substitute or compliment to traditional clinical trials. 
      However, to utilize RWD and RWE appropriately and wisely, it is critical to apply 
      rigorous statistical methodologies that enable the robustness of results to be 
      characterized and ascertained. Several statistical methodologies including exact 
      matching, propensity score methods, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons and 
      meta-analysis have been proposed for analyzing RWD. Among them, propensity score 
      method is one of the most commonly used methods for non-randomized trials with 
      indirect comparison. Although massive methodologies and examples have been published 
      and discussed since propensity score methods were introduced, systematic review and 
      discussion of how to rigorously use propensity score methods in the practical 
      clinical development is still deficient. This paper introduces commonly used and 
      emerging propensity score methods with detailed discussions of their pros and cons. 
      Three different case studies are presented to illustrate the practical 
      considerations of utilizing propensity score methods in the study design and 
      evaluation using real-world and historical data. Additional considerations including 
      selection of patient populations, endpoints, baseline covariates, propensity score 
      methods, sensitivity analysis and practical implementation flow in clinical 
      development will be discussed.

TI  - Monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide in chronic migraine: 
      an adjusted indirect treatment comparison.
PG  - 212-217
LID - 10.7399/fh.11419 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: New monoclonal antibodies against the calcitonin generelated peptide 
      pathway have recently been developed for the  prevention of migraine. The aim of 
      this study is to compare the efficacy  of monoclonal antibodies against the 
      calcitonin generelated peptide  pathway drugs in chronic migraine through an 
      adjusted indirect  treatment comparison, and to establish whether they can be 
      considered  equivalent therapeutic alternatives in this pathology. METHOD: A 
      bibliographic search of randomized clinical trials was performed in PubMed database 
      on December 26, 2019. The inclusion criteria were phase II/III randomized clinical 
      trials of  monoclonal antibodies against the calcitonin generelated peptide  pathway 
      with similar population, length of follow-up and treatment  comparator. The 
      reduction of at least 50% migraine-days/month was  selected as efficacy 
      endpoint. Chronic migraine was defined as ≥ 15  headache days/month, of which ≥ 8 
      were migraine-days (event duration  ≥ 4 hours). Randomized clinical trials with 
      different clinical chronic  migraine context and definition of disease were 
      excluded. An indirect  treatment comparison was developed using Bucher's method. 
      The  equivalent therapeutic alternatives positioning guide was used for the  
      evaluation of potentially equivalent alternatives. Delta value (Δ,  maximum 
      difference as clinical criterion of equivalence) was calculated  as half of absolute 
      risk reduction obtained in a meta-analysis of  randomized clinical trials included 
      in indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: Thirty randomized clinical trials were 
      found: erenumab (n =  12), fremanezumab (n = 7), galcanezumab (n = 10) and 
      eptinezumab (n = 1). Three studies were selected: one of erenumab, one of  
      fremanezumab and another of eptinezumab. The rest were not included  in indirect 
      treatment comparison for non-compliance of inclusion criteria.  Results of 
      indirect treatment comparison among different regimens of  studied drugs showed no 
      statistically significant differences, and the  most part of 95% confidence interval 
      was within calculated delta margins (Δ = 9.5%). No relevant safety differences among 
      the three drugs were  found. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect treatment comparison showed no 
      statistically  significant differences in reduction of ≥ 50% migraine days/month  
      between erenumab, fremanezumab and eptinezumab. Probable clinical  equivalence was 
      found between these drugs in terms of efficacy and  safety, therefore they could be 
      considered equivalent therapeutic  alternatives in chronic migraine.

TI  - Efficacy of Once-Weekly Semaglutide vs Empagliflozin Added to Metformin in Type 2 
      Diabetes: Patient-Level Meta-analysis.
PG  - e4593-604
LID - dgaa577 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgaa577 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: No head-to-head trials have directly compared once-weekly (OW) semaglutide, 
      a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, with empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose 
      co-transporter-2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes (T2D). OBJECTIVE: We indirectly 
      compared the efficacy of OW semaglutide 1 mg vs once-daily (OD) empagliflozin 25 mg 
      in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, using 
      individual patient data (IPD) and meta-regression methodology. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: IPD for patients with T2D receiving metformin 
      monotherapy and randomized to OW semaglutide 1 mg (SUSTAIN 2, 3, 8 trials), or to OD 
      empagliflozin 25 mg (PIONEER 2 trial) were included. Meta-regression analyses were 
      adjusted for potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcomes were change from baseline to 
      end-of-treatment (~1 year) in HbA1c (%-point) and body weight (kg). Responder 
      outcomes and other clinically relevant efficacy measures were analyzed. RESULTS: 
      Baseline characteristics were similar between OW semaglutide (n = 995) and 
      empagliflozin (n = 410). Our analyses showed that OW semaglutide significantly 
      reduced mean HbA1c and body weight vs empagliflozin (estimated treatment difference: 
      -0.61%-point [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.72; -0.49] and -1.65 kg [95% CI: 
      -2.22; -1.08], respectively; both P < 0.0001). Complementary analyses supported the 
      robustness of these results. A significantly greater proportion of patients on OW 
      semaglutide vs empagliflozin also achieved HbA1c targets and weight-loss responses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison suggests that OW semaglutide 1 mg provides 
      superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight vs OD empagliflozin 25 mg in patients 
      with T2D when added to metformin monotherapy.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab versus Carboplatin-based Chemotherapy as

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pembrolizumab has been approved in the United States (US) for the 
      first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, 
      who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and with tumors expressing 
      programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (Combined Positive Score ≥ 10), or ineligible for 
      any platinum-containing chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status. Long-term 
      KEYNOTE-052 data continue to demonstrate pembrolizumab's meaningful, durable, and 
      well-tolerated antitumor activity. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of 
      pembrolizumab versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine as first-line treatment for 
      cisplatin-ineligible patients who have PD-L1-positive tumors from a US third-party 
      healthcare payer's perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model 
      containing 3 health states (progression-free, progressed, and death) was developed. 
      A simulated treatment comparison and a network meta-analysis were conducted to 
      estimate the comparative efficacy of pembrolizumab versus carboplatin-based 
      chemotherapy. Overall survival, progression-free survival, time on treatment, 
      adverse events, and utilities were modeled using the final analyses of the 
      KEYNOTE-052 trial and 4 studies for carboplatin plus gemcitabine. Cost data were 
      estimated using US standard sources and real-world data. Deterministic, 
      probabilistic, and scenario analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of 
      the results. RESULTS: Over 20 years, pembrolizumab resulted in a mean gain of 2.58 
      life-years, 2.01 quality-adjusted life-years, and additional costs of $158,561, 
      leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $78,925/quality-adjusted 
      life-year compared with carboplatin plus gemcitabine. CONCLUSION: This study 
      suggests that pembrolizumab is cost-effective compared with carboplatin plus 
      gemcitabine as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic 
      urothelial carcinoma who are PD-L1-positive.

TI  - Daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone vs standard-of-care regimens: Efficacy in 
      transplant-ineligible untreated myeloma.
PG  - 1486-1494
LID - 10.1002/ajh.25963 [doi]
AB  - Daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide-dexamethasone (D-Rd) recently received 
      FDA approval for the treatment of transplant-ineligible patients with newly 
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). The present PEGASUS study compared 
      progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with D-Rd in the MAIA trial and 
      patients treated with common standard-of-care regimens from the Flatiron Health 
      electronic health record-derived deidentified database, which has data from patients 
      treated primarily at community-based oncology practices in the United States. 
      Individual-level patient data from both data sources were used to perform an 
      anchored indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of D-Rd to 
      bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (VRd) and bortezomib-dexamethasone (Vd); 
      lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd) was the common anchor for the ITC. Hazard ratios 
      (HRs) reflecting direct comparisons of PFS within MAIA (D-Rd vs Rd) and Flatiron 
      Health (VRd vs Rd; Vd vs Rd) were used to make ITCs for D-Rd vs VRd and Vd, 
      respectively. After application of MAIA inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
      propensity-score weighting, the Flatiron Health patients resembled the MAIA trial 
      population on measured baseline characteristics. Based on the direct comparison 
      within MAIA, treatment with D-Rd was associated with a significantly lower risk of 
      progression or death compared to Rd (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42, 0.71). Based on the ITCs, 
      D-Rd was associated with a significantly lower risk of progression or death compared 
      to VRd (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48, 0.98) and Vd (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.33, 0.69). In the 
      absence of head-to-head trials comparing D-Rd to VRd or Vd, the present ITC may help 
      inform treatment selection in transplant-ineligible patients with NDMM.

TI  - Cladribine vs other drugs in MS: Merging randomized trial with real-life data.
LID - 10.1212/NXI.0000000000000878 [doi]
LID - e878
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cladribine tablets were tested against placebo in randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs). In this study, the effectiveness of cladribine vs other approved 
      drugs in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) was compared by matching RCT to 
      observational data. METHODS: Data from the pivotal trial assessing cladribine 
      tablets vs placebo (CLARITY) were propensity score matched to data from the Italian 
      multicenter database i-MuST. This database included 3,150 patients diagnosed between 
      2010 and 2018 at 24 Italian MS centers who started a disease-modifying drug. The 
      annualized relapse rate (ARR) over 2 years from treatment start and the 24-week 
      confirmed disability progression were compared between patients treated with 
      cladribine and other approved drugs (interferon, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, 
      natalizumab, and dimethyl fumarate), with comparisons with placebo as a reference. 
      Treatment effects were estimated by the inverse probability weighting negative 
      binomial regression model for ARR and Cox model for disability progression. The 
      treatment effect has also been evaluated according to baseline disease activity. 
      RESULTS: All weighted baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. 
      All drugs tested had an effect vs placebo close to that detected in the RCT. 
      Patients treated with cladribine had a significantly lower ARR compared with 
      interferon (relapse ratio [RR] = 0.48; p < 0.001), glatiramer acetate (RR = 0.49; p 
      < 0.001), and dimethyl fumarate (RR = 0.6; p = 0.001); a similar ARR to that with 
      fingolimod (RR = 0.74; p = 0.24); and a significantly higher ARR than natalizumab 
      (RR = 2.13; p = 0.014), confirming results obtained by indirect treatment 
      comparisons from RCTs (network meta-analyses). The relative effect of cladribine 
      tablets 10 mg (cumulative dose 3.5 mg/kg over 2 years) was higher in patients with 
      high disease activity vs all treatments except fingolimod and natalizumab. Effects 
      on disability progression were largely nonsignificant, probably due to lack of power 
      for such analysis. CONCLUSION: In patients with RRMS, cladribine tablets showed 
      lower ARR compared with matched patients who started interferon, glatiramer acetate, 
      or dimethyl fumarate; was similar to fingolimod; and was higher than natalizumab. 
      The beneficial effect of cladribine tablets was generally amplified in the subgroup 
      of patients with high disease activity. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study 
      provides Class III evidence that for patients with RRMS, cladribine-treated patients 
      had lower ARR compared with interferon, glatiramer acetate, or dimethyl fumarate; 
      similar ARR compared with fingolimod; and higher ARR compared with natalizumab.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Commonly Used Insulin Analogues in the Treatment of Diabetic 
      Ketoacidosis: A Bayesian Indirect Treatment Comparison.

AB  - PURPOSE: Insulin analogues (IAs) are the mainstay for the management of diabetic 
      ketoacidosis (DKA). However, the relative efficacy of newer IAs is uncertain. The 
      aim of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and safety of IAs for the 
      management of DKA using an indirect treatment comparison (ITC). METHODS: PubMed, 
      EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short-, rapid-, and long-acting IAs in 
      patients with DKA. The primary outcomes of interest were time taken to normalize DKA 
      and time taken to normalize blood glucose levels. The secondary outcomes of interest 
      were the amount of insulin needed to normalize DKA, the length of hospital stay, and 
      the number of hypoglycemic events in the intervention and comparator groups. 
      Bayesian ITC was performed by using the gemtc package in the R program. Continuous 
      outcomes are reported as mean difference (MD), and binary outcomes are reported as 
      odds ratios (ORs), with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). The Cochrane risk of bias 
      tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included RCTs. FINDINGS: Ten RCTs 
      randomizing 435 participants to treatment were included in this ITC. A total of 5 
      interventions (lispro, glargine with regular insulin [RI], glulisine, aspart, and 
      regular insulin) were compared for both safety and efficacy outcomes in DKA. 
      Glargine co-administered with regular insulin showed superiority for clinical 
      outcomes compared with regular insulin: consuming less time (MD, -3.1 h; 95% 
      CrI, -7.9 to 1.8), amount of insulin required (MD, -32 U; 95% CrI, 83.0 to 18.0), 
      and the length of hospitalization (MD, -0.82 day; 95% CrI, -2.7 to 1.0) to normalize 
      DKA. However, these results were not statistically significant. Insulin aspart had 
      fewer reports of hypoglycemic events (OR, 1.7; 95% CrI, 0.34 to 9.3) than regular 
      insulin. IMPLICATIONS: Newer IAs were found to be equally effective and safe as 
      regular insulin in the treatment of DKA. Thus, administering these IAs can be 
      considered a safe and cost-effective alternative for DKA management in non-ICU 
      settings. Cost-effective analysis of the newer IAs is needed because these agents 
      are expensive compared with regular insulin.

TI  - The Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Versus Adjuvant Therapy for Resectable Esophageal Cancer 
      Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 4161-4174
LID - 10.1007/s00268-020-05721-w [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inconclusive results are available as to whether chemo/radiotherapy 
      should be administered to resectable esophageal cancer patients before surgery 
      (neoadjuvant therapy) or after surgery (adjuvant therapy). The paper, via a 
      meta-analysis of effects of treatment modalities when administering 
      chemo/radiotherapy, aims to systematically evaluate the effect of timing of 
      chemo/radiotherapy and surgery. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search 
      for clinical trials of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for patients with esophageal 
      cancer. Using meta-analysis, we conducted direct and adjusted indirect comparisons 
      of overall survival, complete resection rate (R0 resection), perioperative 
      mortality, leakage rate and local recurrence in patients with resectable esophageal 
      cancer. RESULTS: A total of 32 studies involving 7985 patients with esophageal 
      cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Twenty-five randomized controlled studies 
      indirectly compared neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy with surgery alone, while five 
      non-randomized controlled studies and two randomized controlled studies directly 
      compared neoadjuvant with adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, 
      compared with surgery along with adjuvant therapy, showed a significant overall 
      survival advantage in our pooled analysis (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79-0.98). Directly 
      compared with adjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant therapy demonstrated a lower local 
      recurrence rate (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.43-0.74) with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 1%). 
      Neoadjuvant therapy, comparing to surgery with or without adjuvant therapy, showed a 
      significantly higher R0 resection rate (OR 2.86; 95% CI 2.02-4.04) with moderate 
      heterogeneity (I(2) = 38%) and no significant differences in postoperative 
      anastomotic leakage (P = 0.50). However, neoadjuvant therapy, compared with surgery 
      adjuvant therapy, significantly increased perioperative mortality in both direct and 
      indirect comparisons (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found that neoadjuvant therapy was 
      associated with higher overall survival and R0 resection rate without increasing 
      postoperative anastomotic leakage for patients with resectable esophageal cancer, 
      whereas neoadjuvant therapy was associated with higher perioperative mortality after 
      esophagectomy.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of front-line treatments for advanced Hodgkin lymphoma: a 
      systematic literature review.
PG  - 907-922
LID - 10.1080/17474086.2020.1793666 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess evidence on the safety and efficacy of ABVD (doxorubicin 
      [Adriamycin®], bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine), BEACOPP (bleomycin, 
      etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and 
      prednisone), and A+AVD (brentuximab vedotin, with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and 
      dacarbazine) for advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). METHODS: A systematic 
      literature review (SLR) was conducted on 29 July 2016 (updated 26 July 2018) to 
      identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs assessing the treatment of 
      newly-diagnosed advanced-stage HL with ABVD and BEACOPP (and their variants), and 
      A+AVD. RESULTS: The SLR identified 62 RCTs and 42 non-RCTs. Five-year overall 
      survival rates for ABVD and BEACOPP were 60-97% and 84-99%, and 5-year 
      progression-free survival rates were 58-81% and 83-96%, respectively. Both regimens 
      were associated with tolerability issues and side effects. Discontinuation or dose 
      reduction of bleomycin resulted in fewer adverse events, without significantly 
      affecting efficacy. A head-to-head trial demonstrated improved efficacy for A+AVD vs 
      ABVD, with an acceptable tolerability profile. No data from head-to-head trials 
      comparing A+AVD with BEACOPP were available, and an indirect treatment 
      comparison was not feasible. CONCLUSION: New therapies, such as A+AVD, maintain the 
      efficacy observed with current treatments, and may provide a more tolerable 
      treatment option for patients with advanced-stage HL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies had shown that prophylactic use of antibiotics could 
      significantly reduce the intracranial infection (ICI) rate of craniotomy. However, 
      there has been no comparison of these antibiotics. METHODS: An electronic database 
      search was performed, from inception to June 102,020. Randomized controlled trials 
      (RCT) using different intravenous antibiotics (IVA) against the ICIs after 
      craniotomy were considered. The primary outcome was the incidence rates of ICIs. An 
      indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was conducted to compare the protective effect 
      among the diverse antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent ICIs after craniotomy. Risk of 
      potential bias was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 3214 patients after craniotomy in 
      11 studies were included, 159 patients experienced postoperative ICI, including 33 
      patients in the antibacterial group and 126 in the control group. The calculate 
      results of meta-analysis showed that except fusidic acid, preoperative intravenous 
      injection of cephalosporin, clindamycin, vancomycin, and penicillin can 
      significantly reduce the incidence of ICI after craniotomy, and ITC showed there was 
      no statistically significance difference in the rates of post craniotomy ICI between 
      the various antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The current evidence shows that low-grade 
      antibacterial drugs can be selected to prevent ICI after craniotomy, but this may be 
      due to the limited number of studies per antibiotic. It still needs more 
      high-quality, large sample RCT to confirm. SYSTEMIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

TI  - Perspective of the comparative effectiveness of non-pharmacologic managements on 
      postpartum hemorrhage using a network meta-analysis.
PG  - 605-614
LID - 10.5468/ogs.20080 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality 
      worldwide and is both unpredictable and inevitable. While uterotonic drugs are 
      routinely recommended, there is ongoing debate on the ideal intervention to control 
      uterine bleeding. This review aims to compare the use of non-pharmacologic 
      treatments with peripartum hysterectomy in cases of life-threatening uncontrolled 
      obstetric hemorrhage. The review's objective is to use a network meta-analysis to 
      help prevent maternal deaths and rank the treatments according to success rates. 
      METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from 
      January 2014 until December 2018. A second search was carried out in April 2019 
      before the final data analysis. Network meta-analysis allows for the calculation of 
      the effect size between treatment groups through indirect treatment comparison. 
      RESULTS: We confirmed that balloon-assisted management is the best intervention for 
      uncontrolled postpartum bleeding with pharmacologic treatment. This is followed by 
      uterine artery embolization and surgical procedures, which can help avoid the need 
      for a hysterectomy. The balloon tamponade demonstrated lower failure rate than the 
      surgical procedure with odds ratio (OR) of 0.44 and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
      0.50-30.54. Uterine artery embolization had a lower risk for hysterectomy than the 
      surgical procedure group (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.22-2.50). CONCLUSION: For the quick 
      treatment of postpartum bleeding, balloon tamponade is the best method for 
      uncontrolled postpartum bleeding with pharmacologic treatment, followed by uterine 
      artery embolization and surgical procedures.

TI  - A Cost-Consequence Analysis of the Preferential Use of Secukinumab Versus Adalimumab 
      for the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis.
LID - S1699-258X(20)30132-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.reuma.2020.05.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficiency of secukinumab compared to adalimumab as first 
      biologic treatment for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) from the Spanish National Health 
      System (SNHS) perspective. METHODS: A cost-consequence analysis of the cost and 
      clinical response of two treatment strategies was conducted over a 2-year time 
      horizon. A hypothetical cohort of 10 patients with PsA initiated treatment with 
      secukinumab 150mg (cohort A) or adalimumab 40mg (cohort B), respectively. Patients 
      achieving clinical response (ACR20/50/70) at week 24 continued the initial 
      treatment, while patients with inadequate response switched to secukinumab 300mg. 
      Pharmacological costs were calculated based on SmPC (notified ex-factory price). The 
      lowest cost of adalimumab biosimilar was considered. Data on clinical response were 
      extracted from the two matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) published 
      comparing secukinumab vs adalimumab. Results were expressed as the cost difference 
      between the two cohorts (€, 2019) and were calculated for each clinical response 
      criteria (ACR20/50/70) and for each MAIC. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact 
      of potential discounts on the cost of adalimumab while maintaining the cost of 
      secukinumab unchanged. RESULTS: Depending on the MAIC used, the cost of initiating 
      biologic treatment for PsA with secukinumab 150mg was 18-33% lower than the one 
      estimated for adalimumab 40mg, for ACR20, 18-28% for ACR50, and 16-23% for ACR70 
      response rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that it would be necessary a discount of 
      40-60%, 40-65% and 50-75% over the adalimumab cost to compensate for the differences 
      in efficacy observed for ACR20/50/70, respectively, depending on the MAIC used. 
      CONCLUSION: In patients with PsA, secukinumab could be considered a more efficient 
      first-line biologic treatment compared to adalimumab, from the SNHS perspective.

TI  - Multilevel network meta-regression for population-adjusted treatment comparisons.
PG  - 1189-1210
LID - 10.1111/rssa.12579 [doi]
AB  - Standard network meta-analysis (NMA) and indirect comparisons combine aggregate data 
      from multiple studies on treatments of interest, assuming that any effect modifiers 
      are balanced across populations. Population adjustment methods relax this assumption 
      using individual patient data from one or more studies. However, current 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison and simulated treatment comparison methods are 
      limited to pairwise indirect comparisons and cannot predict into a specified target 
      population. Existing meta-regression approaches incur aggregation bias. We propose a 
      new method extending the standard NMA framework. An individual level regression 
      model is defined, and aggregate data are fitted by integrating over the covariate 
      distribution to form the likelihood. Motivated by the complexity of the closed form 
      integration, we propose a general numerical approach using quasi-Monte-Carlo 
      integration. Covariate correlation structures are accounted for by using copulas. 
      Crucially for decision making, comparisons may be provided in any target population 
      with a given covariate distribution. We illustrate the method with a network of 
      plaque psoriasis treatments. Estimated population-average treatment effects are 
      similar across study populations, as differences in the distributions of effect 
      modifiers are small. A better fit is achieved than a random effects NMA, uncertainty 
      is substantially reduced by explaining within- and between-study variation, and 
      estimates are more interpretable.

TI  - Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab versus Existing Immunotherapies in Patients with 
      PD-L1-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Network 
      Meta-Analysis.

LID - 1905
AB  - No head-to-head trials have compared the efficacy and safety of nivolumab (Niv) plus 
      ipilimumab (Ipi) combination therapy (Niv+Ipi) and existing regimens with 
      immunotherapies approved as first-line treatment in patients with programmed cell 
      death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC). We conducted a network meta-analysis of four relevant Phase Ⅲ trials 
      to compare the efficacy and safety of Niv+Ipi, pembrolizumab (Pem) plus 
      platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) (Pem+PBC), Pem, Niv, or PBC using Bayesian 
      analysis. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in 
      patients with advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥1%. The primary safety endpoint 
      was the incidence of Grade 3-5 drug-related adverse events (G3-5AEs). Efficacy and 
      safety were ranked using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). With 
      regard to PFS, Niv+Ipi was inferior to Pem+PBC, and superior to Pem, Niv, or PBC 
      alone. SUCRA ranking showed Pem+PBC had the highest efficacy for PFS, followed by 
      Niv+Ipi, Niv, PBC, and Pem. The safety outcome analysis revealed Niv+Ipi was 
      generally well tolerated compared to existing immunotherapy regimens. These results 
      provide clinical information regarding the efficacy and safety of Niv+Ipi and 
      indicate the possibility of the Niv+Ipi combination as a new therapeutic option in 
      PD-L1-positive advanced NSCLC.

TI  - A systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of perampanel versus 
      brivaracetam as adjunctive therapy in patients with focal-onset seizures with or 
      without secondary generalization.

AB  - PURPOSE: To date, there has not been a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
      conducted to directly compare the efficacy and safety of perampanel to brivaracetam 
      in the adjunctive treatment of focal-onset seizures. This study makes these 
      comparisons through the use of indirect treatment comparison (ITC) methods. METHODS: 
      A systematic review was conducted to identify RCTs that evaluated either one of 
      perampanel or brivaracetam in the treatment of patients with focal-onset seizures. 
      The Bucher ITC method was then used to compare efficacy and safety outcomes between 
      perampanel and brivaracetam. Additional subgroup analyses, by levetiracetam usage 
      (prior or concomitant), were conducted. RESULTS: Eight RCTs (four comparing 
      perampanel to placebo, four comparing brivaracetam to placebo) were included in the 
      ITC. For patients taking concomitant levetiracetam, perampanel showed a 
      significantly better responder rate compared to brivaracetam [relative risk (RR) and 
      95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.62 (1.15, 5.99)]. For patients who had previously, 
      or never, taken levetiracetam, there was no difference in the responder rate. In the 
      overall population, both perampanel and brivaracetam were more effective than 
      placebo in terms of responder rate, seizure freedom, and secondarily generalized 
      tonic-clonic seizure responder rate; however, for these outcomes, no evidence of a 
      difference between perampanel and brivaracetam was found. Patients taking 
      brivaracetam showed significantly less dizziness compared to patients taking 
      perampanel. No differences for any other safety outcome were found. CONCLUSION: 
      Perampanel and brivaracetam are effective for the adjunctive treatment of 
      focal-onset seizures and display similar adverse event profiles. Perampanel 
      demonstrated an improved focal-onset seizure responder rate compared to brivaracetam 
      in patients taking concomitant levetiracetam. This may be due to the similarity in 
      the mechanism of action between brivaracetam and levetiracetam.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of LAMA/LABA Fixed-Dose Combination Therapies in Chronic 
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Systematic Review of Direct and Indirect Treatment 
      Comparisons.
PG  - 1529-1543
LID - 10.2147/COPD.S230955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This literature review assessed comparative efficacy and safety of 
      long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting β(2)-agonist (LAMA/LABA) fixed-dose 
      combinations (FDCs) in patients with COPD and moderate-to-very severe airflow 
      limitation, using evidence from direct (head-to-head) and indirect treatment 
      comparisons. METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify 
      direct comparisons (head-to-head randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) and indirect 
      comparisons (network meta-analyses [NMAs]; indirect treatment comparisons; 
      meta-analyses) in patients with COPD with moderate-to-very severe airflow 
      limitation. Study/Analysis characteristics, eligibility criteria, patient 
      characteristics, and overall conclusions were extracted from relevant publications. 
      The review of indirect comparisons focused on NMAs reporting efficacy outcomes at 12 
      and 24 weeks of treatment (established durations of symptomatic studies in COPD 
      recommended by regulators). RESULTS: Direct comparisons: Four RCTs that provided 
      head-to-head comparisons of LAMA/LABA FDCs were identified, and these varied in 
      their study design, included patient population and reported endpoints. While some 
      differences in lung function outcomes were noted, where assessed, LAMA/LABA FDCs had 
      comparable efficacy in improving symptoms, health status, exacerbations, and 
      comparable safety profiles. However, the differences in study methodology and 
      patient characteristics between these studies made it difficult to draw 
      generalizable conclusions regarding the comparative effectiveness of LAMA/LABA FDCs 
      from the direct comparisons alone. Indirect comparisons: Six NMAs were identified 
      that reported indirect comparisons between LAMA/LABA FDCs; five of these were within 
      the pre-defined scope of this review. Although the scope of each NMA varied, all 
      five concluded that LAMA/LABA FDCs were generally comparable in terms of lung 
      function improvements, patient-reported outcomes, and safety (where assessed). 
      CONCLUSION: Although there were some inconsistencies between the outcomes of RCTs 
      and NMAs for lung function, the totality of lung function, symptoms, exacerbations, 
      and safety data suggests that currently available LAMA/LABA FDCs have comparable 
      efficacy and safety in patients with COPD and moderate-to-very severe airflow 
      limitation.

TI  - Comparison of Methods for Estimating Therapy Effects by Indirect Comparisons: A 
      Simulation Study.
PG  - 644-654
LID - 10.1177/0272989X20929309 [doi]
AB  - Objective. In evidence synthesis, therapeutic options have to be compared despite 
      the lack of head-to-head trials. Indirect comparisons are then widely used, although 
      little is known about their performance in situations where cross-trial differences 
      or effect modification are present. Methods. We contrast the matching adjusted 
      indirect comparison (MAIC), simulated treatment comparison (STC), and the method of 
      Bucher using a simulation study. The different methods are evaluated according to 
      their power and type I error rate as well as with respect to the coverage, bias, and 
      the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the effect estimate for practically relevant 
      scenarios using binary and time-to-event endpoints. In addition, we investigate how 
      the power planned for the head-to-head trials influences the actual power of the 
      indirect comparison. Results. Indirect comparisons are considerably underpowered. 
      None of the methods had substantially superior performance. In situations without 
      cross-trial differences and effect modification, MAIC and Bucher led to similar 
      results, while Bucher has the advantage of preserving the within-study 
      randomization. MAIC and STC could enhance power in some scenarios but at the cost of 
      a potential type I error inflation. Adjusting MAIC and STC for confounders that did 
      not modify the effect led to higher bias and RMSE. Conclusion. The choice of effect 
      modifiers in MAIC and STC influences the precision of the indirect comparison. 
      Therefore, a careful selection of effect modifiers is warranted. In addition, missed 
      differences between trials may lead to low power and partly high bias for all 
      considered methods, and thus, results of indirect comparisons should be interpreted 
      with caution.

AB  - Aim: To perform indirect treatment comparisons of entrectinib versus alternative 
      ROS1 fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer treatments. Methods: Relevant 
      studies with crizotinib and chemotherapy as comparators of interest identified by 
      systematic literature review were selected for matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      by feasibility assessment. Matching was based on known prognostic/predictive 
      factors and scenario analyses were used for unreported confounders in comparator 
      trials. Results: Entrectinib yielded significantly better responses versus 
      crizotinib in all scenarios (odds ratio [OR]: 2.43-2.74). Overall survival (hazard 
      ratio: 0.47-0.61) and adverse event-related discontinuation (OR: 0.79-0.90) favored 
      entrectinib. Progression-free survival was similar across treatments, except in one 
      scenario. Conclusion: These results suggested improved outcomes with entrectinib 
      versus crizotinib/chemotherapy and may help to make better informed treatment 
      decisions.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of biological medicines in rheumatoid arthritis: 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis including aggregate results from 
      reanalysed individual patient data.
PG  - m2288

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the comparative effectiveness of biological medicines in 
      rheumatoid arthritis in sufficiently similar patient populations, based on the 
      current definitions of key outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review and network 
      meta-analysis including aggregate results from reanalysed individual patient data. 
      DATA SOURCES: Clinical study reports and aggregate results from reanalyses of 
      individual patient data on key outcomes for rheumatoid arthritis provided by study 
      sponsors for studies conducted up to 2017, and several databases and registries from 
      inception up to February 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: 
      Randomised controlled trials investigating patient relevant outcomes in adults with 
      rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological medicines in combination with 
      methotrexate after methotrexate failure for at least 24 weeks. RESULTS: 45 eligible 
      trials were identified. Combining data from clinical study reports and aggregate 
      results from reanalyses of individual patient data allowed extensive analyses 
      yielding sufficiently similar populations and homogeneous study results for network 
      meta-analyses, including up to 35 studies on eight biological medicines combined 
      with methotrexate. These analyses showed few statistically significant differences 
      between the combination treatments. For example, anakinra showed less benefit than 
      almost all the other seven biological medicines regarding clinical remission or low 
      disease activity (clinical disease activity index ≤2.8 or ≤10, respectively) and 
      certolizumab pegol showed more harm than the other seven biological medicines 
      regarding serious adverse events or infections. Some outcomes had very wide 95% 
      confidence intervals, potentially implying unidentified differences between the 
      eight biological medicines, but wide 95% confidence intervals were less prominent 
      for low disease activity, serious adverse events, and infections. Owing to a lack of 
      head-to-head trials, results were mainly based on indirect comparisons with a 
      limited number of studies, and recently approved Janus kinase inhibitors could not 
      be included. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with rheumatoid arthritis after methotrexate 
      failure, only minor differences in benefits and harms were seen between biological 
      medicines in combination with methotrexate. However, the analysis was hampered by a 
      lack of long term direct comparisons. The substantial information gain achieved by 
      the reanalysis of individual patient data calls for the routine availability of 
      individual patient data.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi versus IDegLira in adults with type 2 diabetes 
      inadequately controlled by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: a systematic 
      literature review and indirect treatment comparison.
PG  - 2170-2178
LID - 10.1111/dom.14136 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To estimate the relative treatment effect between the fixed-ratio combinations 
      iGlarLixi and IDegLira (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist with basal insulin) 
      in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on a glucagon-like peptide 1 
      receptor agonist. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review of 
      randomized controlled trials followed by an indirect treatment comparison was 
      performed to compare the efficacy and safety of the available fixed-ratio 
      combinations. Main outcomes were glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change and target 
      achievement [<6.5% and <7.0% (<48 and <53 mmol/mol)], fasting plasma glucose, 
      self-monitored plasma glucose, body weight, and incidence and rate of hypoglycaemia. 
      RESULTS: From 4850 abstracts screened, 78 qualified for full-text article review and 
      two randomized controlled trials were included. Baseline characteristics were 
      similar in the two studies. The mean difference at 26 weeks between IDegLira and 
      iGlarLixi was -0.36 (95% credible intervals -0.58, -0.14) % [-3.9 (-6.3, -1.5) 
      mmol/mol] for HbA1c and -1.0 (-1.6, -0.4) mmol/L for fasting plasma glucose. No 
      significant differences were found in HbA1c target attainment, preprandial or 
      postprandial self-monitored plasma glucose, or body weight change. Formal 
      comparisons of hypoglycaemia were limited by differences in definitions between the 
      studies: in non-sulphonylurea users, incidence was 28% for IDegLira ('confirmed' at 
      ≤3.1 mmol/L); for iGlarLixi, incidence was 9% ('documented symptomatic' at 
      <3.0 mmol/L). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this indirect treatment comparison using two 
      studies suggest iGlarLixi and IDegLira appear to offer similar benefits for HbA1c 
      target achievement. However, the findings suggest differences in other glycaemia 
      results and hypoglycaemia, which may reflect differences in study design and 
      titration approaches.

      relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 849-860
LID - 10.2217/cer-2020-0069 [doi]
AB  - Aim: We compared outcomes from a single-arm study of tisagenlecleucel with standard 
      of care (SOC) regimens in pediatric and young adult patients with 
      relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods: The analysis 
      included one tisagenlecleucel study, one blinatumomab study, one clofarabine 
      monotherapy study, three studies of clofarabine combination regimens and two studies 
      of other salvage chemotherapy. Matching-adjusted indirect comparison analyses were 
      conducted. Results: After adjusting for baseline characteristics, tisagenlecleucel 
      was associated with significantly prolonged overall survival compared with 
      blinatumomab (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.32 [0.16-0.64]); clofarabine monotherapy 
      (0.24 [0.13-0.42]); clofarabine combination regimens (0.26 [0.15-0.45]); two salvage 
      therapies (0.15 [0.09-0.25] and 0.27 [0.15-0.49]). Conclusion: The analysis 
      demonstrated tisagenlecleucel was associated with substantially greater survival 
      benefit versus all SOC regimens.

TI  - Component network meta-analysis compared to a matching method in a disconnected 
      network: A case study.
PG  - 447-461
LID - 10.1002/bimj.201900339 [doi]
AB  - Network meta-analysis is a method to combine evidence from randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) that compare a number of different interventions for a given clinical 
      condition. Usually, this requires a connected network. A possible approach to link a 
      disconnected network is to add evidence from nonrandomized comparisons, using 
      propensity score or matching-adjusted indirect comparisons methods. However, 
      nonrandomized comparisons may be associated with an unclear risk of bias. Schmitz 
      et al. used single-arm observational studies for bridging the gap between two 
      disconnected networks of treatments for multiple myeloma. We present a reanalysis of 
      these data using component network meta-analysis (CNMA) models entirely based on 
      RCTs, utilizing the fact that many of the treatments consisted of common treatment 
      components occurring in both networks. We discuss forward and backward strategies 
      for selecting appropriate CNMA models and compare the results to those obtained by 
      Schmitz et al. using their matching method. CNMA models provided a good fit to the 
      data and led to treatment rankings that were similar, though not fully equal to that 
      obtained by Schmitz et al. We conclude that researchers encountering a disconnected 
      network with treatments in different subnets having common components should 
      consider a CNMA model. Such models, exclusively based on evidence from RCTs, are a 
      promising alternative to matching approaches that require additional evidence from 
      observational studies. CNMA models are implemented in the R package netmeta.

TI  - Psychological interventions to improve self-management of type 1 and type 2 
      diabetes: a systematic review.
PG  - 1-232
LID - 10.3310/hta24280 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For people with diabetes mellitus to achieve optimal glycaemic control, 
      motivation to perform self-management is important. The research team wanted to 
      determine whether or not psychological interventions are clinically effective and 
      cost-effective in increasing self-management and improving glycaemic control. 
      OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to determine the clinical effectiveness of 
      psychological interventions for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and people with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus so that they have improved (1) glycated haemoglobin levels, 
      (2) diabetes self-management and (3) quality of life, and fewer depressive symptoms. 
      The second objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of psychological 
      interventions. DATA SOURCES: The following databases were accessed (searches took 
      place between 2003 and 2016): MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials 
      Register, Web of Science, and Dissertation Abstracts International. Diabetes 
      conference abstracts, reference lists of included studies and Clinicaltrials.gov 
      trial registry were also searched. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic review, aggregate 
      meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, individual patient data meta-analysis and 
      cost-effectiveness modelling were all used. Risk of bias of randomised and 
      non-randomised controlled trials was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 
      JP, Altman DG, Gøtzsche PC, Jüni P, Moher D, Oxman AD, et al. The Cochrane 
      Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. BMJ 
      2011;343:d5928). DESIGN: Systematic review, meta-analysis, cost-effectiveness 
      analysis and patient and public consultation were all used. SETTING: Settings in 
      primary or secondary care were included. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents and children with 
      type 1 diabetes mellitus and adults with types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus were 
      included. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions used were psychological treatments, 
      including and not restricted to cognitive-behavioural therapy, counselling, family 
      therapy and psychotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glycated haemoglobin levels, 
      self-management behaviours, body mass index, blood pressure levels, depressive 
      symptoms and quality of life were all used as outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 
      96 studies were included in the systematic review (n = 18,659 participants). In 
      random-effects meta-analysis, data on glycated haemoglobin levels were available for 
      seven studies conducted in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 851 
      participants) that demonstrated a pooled mean difference of -0.13 (95% confidence 
      interval -0.33 to 0.07), a non-significant decrease in favour of psychological 
      treatment; 18 studies conducted in adolescents/children with type 1 diabetes 
      mellitus (n = 2583 participants) that demonstrated a pooled mean difference of 0.00 
      (95% confidence interval -0.18 to 0.18), indicating no change; and 49 studies 
      conducted in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 12,009 participants) that 
      demonstrated a pooled mean difference of -0.21 (95% confidence interval -0.31 to 
      -0.10), equivalent to reduction in glycated haemoglobin levels of -0.33% or 
      ≈3.5 mmol/mol. For type 2 diabetes mellitus, there was evidence that psychological 
      interventions improved dietary behaviour and quality of life but not blood pressure, 
      body mass index or depressive symptoms. The results of the network meta-analysis, 
      which considers direct and indirect effects of multiple treatment comparisons, 
      suggest that, for adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (7 studies; 968 
      participants), attention control and cognitive-behavioural therapy are clinically 
      effective and cognitive-behavioural therapy is cost-effective. For adults with type 
      2 diabetes mellitus (49 studies; 12,409 participants), cognitive-behavioural therapy 
      and counselling are effective and cognitive-behavioural therapy is potentially 
      cost-effective. The results of the individual patient data meta-analysis for 
      adolescents/children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (9 studies; 1392 participants) 
      suggest that there were main effects for age and diabetes duration. For adults with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (19 studies; 3639 participants), baseline glycated 
      haemoglobin levels moderated treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS: Aggregate meta-analysis 
      was limited to glycaemic control for type 1 diabetes mellitus. It was not possible 
      to model cost-effectiveness for adolescents/children with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
      and modelling for type 2 diabetes mellitus involved substantial uncertainty. The 
      individual patient data meta-analysis included only 40-50% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This review suggests that psychological treatments offer minimal clinical benefit in 
      improving glycated haemoglobin levels for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      However, there was no evidence of benefit compared with control interventions in 
      improving glycated haemoglobin levels for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
      FUTURE WORK: Future work should consider the competency of the interventionists 
      delivering a therapy and psychological approaches that are matched to a person and 
      their life course. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO 
      CRD42016033619. FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for 
      Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published

OAB - Living with diabetes mellitus (hereafter referred to as diabetes) involves taking on 
      new roles and responsibilities and is key to success in achieving the best diabetes 
      control. There are education programmes that help people with diabetes to access the 
      information and skills needed but managing diabetes is hard and must be done 24/7, 
      causing people to lose motivation. There are many emotional reasons for this. This 
      research team aimed to discover if talking therapies that are designed to help 
      people challenge their negative thoughts and feelings and be more motivated and 
      confident could help improve their self-management and blood glucose levels. The 
      team also wanted to find out if talking therapies could be good value for money and 
      people with diabetes were asked for their views on the research. To conduct the 
      research, electronic databases were searched for studies that have used talking 
      therapies to support diabetes management. It was found that: For adults with type 2 
      diabetes, talking therapies improved diabetes control by only a small amount, 
      although such therapies could represent value for money. People with type 2 diabetes 
      who had talking therapy reported improved diet and quality of life. For adults with 
      type 1 diabetes, some types of talking therapies could improve diabetes control, 
      although this result was uncertain. Talking therapies were not effective for 
      children or adolescents in improving diabetes control but there was not enough data 
      to see if the therapies improved general health and well-being.When the results were 
      presented to people with diabetes, they still wanted access to these treatments, 
      even though results of this research did not suggest, overall, that talking 
      therapies help improve diabetes control.Now that this research is complete, it is 
      suggested that future studies look at whether or not more sessions of talking 
      therapies should be delivered over a longer time period and whether or not the 
      therapies should match the needs of the person with diabetes more closely.

TI  - Comparing Efficacy, Safety, and Preinfusion Period of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel versus 
      Tisagenlecleucel in Relapsed/Refractory Large B Cell Lymphoma.
PG  - 1581-1588

AB  - Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) are autologous 
      anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapies for the treatment of 
      patients with relapsed/refractory large B cell lymphoma (RR-LBCL). Both can induce 
      durable responses; however, cross-trial comparisons are difficult due to differences 
      in study design. In this study, the registration trials of axi-cel and tisa-cel were 
      compared using a matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). A MAIC was performed 
      to adjust for differences in patient characteristics between trials. The estimates 
      for the ZUMA-1 (axi-cel) trial were adjusted using patient-level data to match the 
      study population in JULIET (tisa-cel) for key variables: International Prognostic 
      Index), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, stage, refractoriness or relapsed 
      disease, double/triple hit status, cell of origin, and number of prior lines of 
      therapy. The endpoints analyzed were response, overall survival (OS), and adverse 
      events. After adjusting for differences in patient characteristics between trials, 
      axi-cel was associated with a greater objective response rate (relative risk 
      [RR]=1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29 to 2.01) and complete response 
      (RR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.27) than tisa-cel among patients who underwent 
      infusion. The OS from infusion onward comparing axi-cel to tisa-cel had a hazard 
      ratio of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.83). The indirect comparison showed a higher rate 
      of grade 1 to 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in ZUMA-1 compared with JULIET 
      (RR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.55 to 2.65) and similar rates of grade ≥3 CRS and neurologic 
      events. In the absence of a direct head-to-head study, the MAIC statistical 
      technique suggests axi-cel may have superior efficacy but a greater risk of grade 1 
      to 2 CRS. Future real-world studies can further inform the relative efficacy and 
      safety of CAR T therapies in RR-LBCL.

TI  - Rosacea Treatment Satisfaction: Matching Adjusted Indirect Treatment Comparison 
      Analysis of Metronidazole Gel or Cream vs Azelaic Acid Foam.
PG  - 295-304
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess differences in patient-reported treatment side effects and 
      concerns associated with azelaic acid 15% foam (AAF) vs metronidazole cream (MC) and 
      metronidazole gel (MG). METHODS: This study used matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison (MAIC) to compare patient-reported outcomes from survey data evaluating 
      rosacea treatments. Outcomes of interest included percentages of patients reporting 
      concerns and side effects and measures of importance of the concerns and 
      tolerability of the side effects. Patients in each analysis (MG vs AAF and MC vs 
      AAF) were matched using stabilized inverse propensity scores. RESULTS: When compared 
      to AAF, MG-treated patients more frequently reported concerns with treatment 
      efficacy (54% vs 4%), application (7% vs 3%), and treatment side effects. MC-treated 
      patients more frequently reported concerns with treatment efficacy (61% vs 5%) and 
      dryness (8% vs 5%). AAF-treated patients more frequently reported concerns with cost 
      of treatment compared with MG (7% vs 1%) and MC (9% vs 4%). Among patients reporting 
      concerns, level of importance associated with these concerns was similar for 
      AAF-treated patients compared with MG- and MC-treated patients. When compared to 
      AAF-treated patients, MG-treated patients more frequently reported side effects of 
      dryness (26% vs 15%) and uneven skin tone (3% vs 0%), and MC-treated patients more 
      frequently reported side effects of burning (7% vs 3%), itching (7% vs 5%), and 
      redness (7% vs 5%). MG- and MC-treated patients indicated greater intolerance for 
      reported side effects than AAF-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: MG- and MC-treated 
      patients more frequently reported treatment concerns and side effects than 
      AAF-treated patients, and tolerability of those side effects was higher for patients 
      treated with AAF. While treatment cost is a more frequent concern in patients 
      treated with AAF, these patients less frequently reported concerns with treatment 
      efficacy and reported similar or greater tolerance to side effects than patients 
      treated with either MC or MG. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(3):

      treatment effect estimates in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), thus indirectly 
      measuring the influence of unknown confounders. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This is an 
      analysis of individual patient data of 26 large RCTs and comparison of agreement 
      between PS-matched samples and the RCT results on one hand with the agreement 
      between subsamples of RCTs (with sample sizes equal to the sample sizes of the 
      PS-matched samples) and RCTs by Bland-Altman plots and corresponding intraclass 
      correlation coefficients on the other. RESULTS: We included data on 213 outcomes 
      from 37 treatment comparisons with 193,620 patients from 26 trials. Bland-Altman 
      plots and intraclass correlation coefficients showed better agreement between 
      PS-matched analysis and RCTs than between reduced RCTs and RCTs. CONCLUSION: We 
      found no indication for a detrimental influence of unknown confounders in PS-matched 
      samples of RCTs.

TI  - The Effects of Model Misspecification in Unanchored Matching-Adjusted Indirect 
      Comparison: Results of a Simulation Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the performance of unanchored matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison (MAIC) by matching on first moments or higher moments in a cross-study 
      comparisons under a variety of conditions. A secondary objective was to gauge the 
      performance of the method relative to propensity score weighting (PSW). METHODS: A 
      simulation study was designed based on an oncology example, where MAIC was used to 
      account for differences between a contemporary trial in which patients had more 
      favorable characteristics and a historical control. A variety of scenarios were then 
      tested varying the setup of the simulation study, including violating the implicit 
      or explicit assumptions of MAIC. RESULTS: Under ideal conditions and under a variety 
      of scenarios, MAIC performed well (shown by a low mean absolute error [MAE]) and was 
      unbiased (shown by a mean error [ME] of about zero). The performance of the method 
      deteriorated where the matched characteristics had low explanatory power or there 
      was poor overlap between studies. Only when important characteristics are not 
      included in the matching did the method become biased (nonzero ME). Where the method 
      showed poor performance, this was exaggerated if matching was also performed on the 
      variance (ie, higher moments). Relative to PSW, MAIC provided similar results in 
      most circumstances, although it exhibited slightly higher MAE and a higher chance of 
      exaggerating bias. CONCLUSIONS: MAIC appears well suited to adjust for cross-trial 
      comparisons provided the assumptions underpinning the model are met, with relatively 
      little efficiency loss compared with PSW.

TI  - A Review of Two Regulatory Approved Anti-CD19 CAR T-Cell Therapies in Diffuse Large 
      B-Cell Lymphoma: Why Are Indirect Treatment Comparisons Not Feasible?
PG  - 3040-3058
LID - 10.1007/s12325-020-01397-9 [doi]
AB  - Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies can be effective for 
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a cancer with limited treatment options and 
      poor outcomes, particularly for patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease. 
      Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) are CAR T-cell 
      therapies approved by regulatory bodies for certain patients with r/r DLBCL on the 
      basis of demonstrated treatment effects in their pivotal single-arm trials, ZUMA-1 
      and JULIET, respectively. In the absence of head-to-head trials, the question of 
      whether a valid indirect treatment comparison (ITC) between axi-cel and tisa-cel 
      could be performed using existing evidence is of interest to patients, physicians, 
      payers, and other stakeholders. This article addresses that question by summarizing 
      the current evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies and discussing the 
      challenges and limitations of potential analytical approaches associated with an 
      ITC. Two ITC approaches attempting to adjust for cross-trial heterogeneity between 
      ZUMA-1 and JULIET, matching-adjusted indirect comparison and regression-prediction 
      model analysis, were evaluated. After evaluating the current clinical trial data and 
      real-world evidence, and present and prior ITC analyses of axi-cel and tisa-cel, the 
      authors conclude that a valid comparative analysis is not currently feasible. The 
      substantial differences (e.g., timing of leukapheresis and enrollment, use of 
      bridging chemotherapy [90% in JULIET vs. 0% in ZUMA-1], lymphodepleting regimens) 
      between the two trials' designs and patient populations preclude a robust and 
      reliable ITC. No other approaches are able to account for such differences. The 
      current real-world data are still too immature to be used for ITCs. Thus, drawing 
      conclusions from such ITCs should be avoided to prevent misinforming treatment 
      choices or limiting patient access to effective treatment options. Additional data 
      from ongoing or future real-world studies with appropriate statistical analyses are 
      needed to provide insights into the comparative effectiveness and safety of these 
      two treatments.

TI  - Early Psychosis Intervention-Spreading Evidence-based Treatment (EPI-SET): protocol 
      for an effectiveness-implementation study of a structured model of care for 
      psychosis in youth and emerging adults.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: While early psychosis intervention (EPI) has proliferated in recent 
      years amid evidence of its effectiveness, programmes often struggle to deliver 
      consistent, recovery-based care. NAVIGATE is a manualised model of EPI with 
      demonstrated effectiveness consisting of four components: individualised medication 
      management, individual resiliency training, supported employment and education and 
      family education. We aim to implement NAVIGATE in geographically diverse EPI 
      programmes in Ontario, Canada, evaluating implementation and its effect on fidelity 
      to the EPI model, as well as individual-level outcomes (patient/family 
      member-reported and interviewer-rated), system-level outcomes (captured in 
      provincial administrative databases) and engagement of participants with lived 
      experience. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multisite, non-randomised pragmatic 
      hybrid effectiveness-implementation type III mixed methods study coordinated at the 
      Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto. Implementation is 
      supported by the Provincial System Support Program, a CAMH-based programme with 
      provincial offices across Ontario, and Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes 
      Ontario Mental Health at CAMH and the University of Toronto. The primary outcome is 
      fidelity to the EPI model as measured using the First Episode Psychosis 
      Services-Fidelity Scale. Four hundred participants in the EPI programmes will be 
      recruited and followed using both individual-level assessments and health 
      administrative data for 2 years following NAVIGATE initiation. People with lived 
      experience will be engaged in all aspects of the project, including through youth 
      and family advisory committees. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics board 
      approval has been obtained from CAMH and institutions overseeing the local EPI 
      programmes. Study findings will be reported in scientific journal articles and 
      shared with key stakeholders including youth, family members, programme staff and 
      policymakers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03919760; Pre-results.

LID - 10.2217/cer-2020-0042 [doi]
AB  - Aim: To illustrate that bias associated with indirect treatment comparison and 
      network meta-analyses can be reduced by adjusting for outcomes on common reference 
      arms. Materials & methods: Approaches to adjusting for reference-arm effects are 
      presented within a causal inference framework. Bayesian and Frequentist approaches 
      are applied to three real data examples. Results: Reference-arm adjustment can 
      significantly impact estimated treatment differences, improve model fit and align 
      indirectly estimated treatment effects with those observed in randomized trials. 
      Reference-arm adjustment can possibly reverse the direction of estimated treatment 
      effects. Conclusion: Accumulating theoretical and empirical evidence underscores the 
      importance of adjusting for reference-arm outcomes in indirect treatment comparison 
      and network meta-analyses to make full use of data and reduce the risk of bias in 
      estimated treatments effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Network meta-analyses using individual participant data (IPD-NMAs) have 
      been increasingly used to compare the effects of multiple interventions. Although 
      there have been many studies on statistical methods for IPD-NMAs, it is unclear 
      whether there are statistical defects in published IPD-NMAs and whether the 
      reporting of statistical analyses has improved. This study aimed to investigate 
      statistical methods used and assess the reporting and methodological quality of 
      IPD-NMAs. METHODS: We searched four bibliographic databases to identify published 
      IPD-NMAs. The methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2 and reporting 
      quality assessed based on PRISMA-IPD and PRISMA-NMA. We performed stratified 
      analyses and correlation analyses to explore the factors that might affect quality. 
      RESULTS: We identified 21 IPD-NMAs. Only 23.8% of the included IPD-NMAs reported 
      statistical techniques used for missing participant data, 42.9% assessed the 
      consistency, and none assessed the transitivity. None of the included IPD-NMAs 
      reported sources of funding for trials included, only 9.5% stated pre-registration 
      of protocols, and 28.6% assessed the risk of bias in individual studies. For 
      reporting quality, compliance rates were lower than 50.0% for more than half of the 
      items. Less than 15.0% of the IPD-NMAs reported data integrity, presented the 
      network geometry, or clarified risk of bias across studies. IPD-NMAs with 
      statistical or epidemiological authors often better assessed the inconsistency 
      (P = 0.017). IPD-NMAs with a priori protocol were associated with higher reporting 
      quality in terms of search (P = 0.046), data collection process (P = 0.031), and 
      syntheses of results (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The reporting of statistical methods 
      and compliance rates of methodological and reporting items of IPD-NMAs were 
      suboptimal. Authors of future IPD-NMAs should address the identified flaws and 
      strictly adhere to methodological and reporting guidelines.

AB  - Along with increasing amounts of big data sources and increasing computer 
      performance, real-world evidence from such sources likewise gains in importance. 
      While this mostly applies to population averaged results from analyses based on the 
      all available data, it is also possible to conduct so-called personalized analyses 
      based on a data subset whose observations resemble a particular patient for whom a 
      decision is to be made. Claims data from statutory health insurance companies could 
      provide necessary information for such personalized analyses. To derive treatment 
      recommendations from them for a particular patient in everyday care, an automated, 
      reproducible and efficiently programmed workflow would be required. We introduce the 
      R-package SimBaCo (Similarity-Based Cohort generation) offering a simple, but 
      modular, and intuitive framework for this task. With the six built-in R-functions, 
      this framework allows the user to create similarity cohorts tailored to the 
      characteristics of particular patients. An exemplary workflow illustrates the 
      distinct steps beginning with an initial cohort selection according to inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria. A plotting function facilitates investigating a particular 
      patient's characteristics relative to their distribution in a reference cohort, for 
      example the initial cohort or the precision cohort after the data has been trimmed 
      in accordance with chosen variables for similarity finding. Such precision cohorts 
      allow any form of personalized analysis, for example personalized analyses of 
      comparative effectiveness or customized prediction models developed from precision 
      cohorts. In our exemplary workflow, we provide such a treatment comparison whereupon 
      a treatment decision for a particular patient could be made. This is only one field 
      of application where personalized results can directly support the process of 
      clinical reasoning by leveraging information from individual patient data. With this 
      modular package at hand, personalized studies can efficiently weight benefits and 
      risks of treatment options of particular patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our objectives were to develop a disease progression model for cognitive 
      decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to determine whether disease progression of 
      AD is related to the year of publication, add-on trial design, and geographical 
      regions. METHODS: Placebo-controlled randomized AD clinical trials were systemically 
      searched in public databases. Longitudinal placebo response (mean change from 
      baseline in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale 
      [ADAS-cog]) and the corresponding demographic information were extracted to 
      establish a disease progression model. Covariate screening and subgroup analyses 
      were performed to identify potential factors affecting the disease progression rate. 
      RESULTS: A total of 134 publications (140 trials) were included in this model-based 
      meta-analysis. The typical disease progression rate was 5.82 points per year. The 
      baseline ADAS-cog score was included in the final model using an inverse U-type 
      function. Age was found to be negatively correlated with disease progression rate. 
      After correcting the baseline ADAS-cog score and the age effect, no significant 
      difference in the disease progression rate was found between trials published before 
      and after 2008 and between trials using an add-on design and those that did not use 
      an add-on design. However, a significant difference was found among different trial 
      regions. Trials in East Asian countries showed the slowest decline rate and the 
      largest placebo effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our model successfully quantified AD disease 
      progression by integrating baseline ADAS-cog score and age as important predictors. 
      These factors and geographic location should be considered when optimizing future 
      trial designs and conducting indirect comparisons of clinical outcomes.

AB  - Alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) leads to enormous disease burden and occupies a substantial 
      proportion in the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but scarce attention 
      has been paid to this topic. Besides, propranolol has been reported to decrease the 
      rate of HCC in viral hepatitis. We conducted a retrospective tertiary-center cohort 
      study to identify the HCC incidence in AC patients with or without propranolol. A 
      total of 1,046 AC patients with hospitalization had been screened, and those with 
      regular follow-up for three years or otherwise until the date of malignancy 
      diagnosis without meeting exclusion criteria were enrolled; finally, 23 AC patients 
      with propranolol and 46 AC patients without propranolol were analyzed after twofold 
      propensity-score matching. The cumulative incidence of HCC was lower in the 
      propranolol group (log-rank test, P = 0.046). Furthermore, we undertook the 
      meta-analysis of annual incidence of HCC in AC patients, and 1,949 publications were 
      screened, within which eight studies were analyzed; the pooled annual incidence was 
      2.41%, which was higher than the calculated annual incidence of HCC in our AC cohort 
      with propranolol (1.45%). In conclusion, propranolol is associated with decreased 
      risk of HCC incidence in patients with AC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No trials have compared cabozantinib and regorafenib for the second-line 
      treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OBJECTIVES: Conduct a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of the efficacy and safety of 
      second-line cabozantinib and regorafenib in patients with advanced HCC and disease 
      progression after prior sorafenib. METHODS: The CELESTIAL and RESORCE trials were 
      used for indirect comparison of second-line cabozantinib and regorafenib in advanced 
      HCC. Population-level data were available for RESORCE, individual patient data (IPD) 
      for CELESTIAL. To align with RESORCE, the CELESTIAL population was limited to 
      patients who received first-line sorafenib only. To minimize potential 
      effect-modifying population differences, the CELESTIAL IPD were weighted to balance 
      the distribution of clinically relevant baseline characteristics with those of 
      RESORCE. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated 
      for the matching-adjusted second-line CELESTIAL population and compared with those 
      for RESORCE using weighted Kaplan-Meier curves and parametric modeling. Rates of 
      grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) affecting > 5% of patients in 
      any study arm were compared. RESULTS: In the matching-adjusted second-line 
      populations (CELESTIAL, effective sample size = 266; RESORCE, n = 573), median (95% 
      confidence interval) OS was similar for cabozantinib and regorafenib (11.4 
      [8.9-17.0] versus 10.6 [9.1-12.1] months; p = 0.3474, log-rank test). Median PFS was 
      longer for cabozantinib than regorafenib (5.6 [4.9-7.3] versus 3.1 [2.8-4.2] months; 
      p = 0.0005, log-rank test). There was a trend for lower rates of some grade 3/4 
      TEAEs with regorafenib than with cabozantinib, which may reflect the exclusion of 
      sorafenib-intolerant patients from RESORCE but not from CELESTIAL, a difference that 
      the MAIC methods could not remove. Only diarrhea rates were statistically 
      significantly lower for regorafenib (p  ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib may 
      achieve similar OS and prolonged PFS compared with regorafenib in patients with 
      progressive advanced HCC after prior sorafenib.

OAB - Cabozantinib and regorafenib are treatments approved for some patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer, after disease progression 
      despite prior sorafenib treatment. Cabozantinib, regorafenib and sorafenib are 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), meaning that they slow cancer progression by 
      targeting specific ways that tumors grow. Cabozantinib and regorafenib offer 
      benefits to patients compared with placebo (i.e., no treatment) for those who have 
      progressed despite sorafenib treatment. No clinical studies have compared 
      cabozantinib and regorafenib directly. This study compared the efficacy and safety 
      of cabozantinib and regorafenib using data from trials of each drug versus placebo: 
      CELESTIAL for cabozantinib and RESORCE for regorafenib. These two trials were 
      similar—both involved patients with progressive advanced HCC who had received 
      previous cancer treatment. There were some important differences, but these were 
      minimized using statistical methods (matching and adjustments/“weighting”) allowing 
      outcomes to be meaningfully compared. One difference that could not be removed by 
      the statistical methods was that patients who were intolerant to prior sorafenib 
      were excluded from RESORCE but were eligible for the CELESTIAL trial. In the 
      otherwise matched populations, treatment with cabozantinib was associated with 
      similar overall survival and significantly longer progression-free survival than 
      regorafenib. Rates of diarrhea were significantly lower for regorafenib than 
      cabozantinib, suggesting that regorafenib may be better tolerated, but this may 
      reflect the exclusion of sorafenib-intolerant patients from RESORCE. These findings 
      cannot replace a head-to-head study, but may help in guiding decision-making between 
      cabozantinib and regorafenib in patients with progressive advanced HCC after 
      soraftenib treatment.

TI  - The cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy or atezolizumab as 
      second-line therapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma in the United States.
PG  - 967-977
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2020.1770261 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Pembrolizumab demonstrated significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) vs. 
      chemotherapy in the Phase III KEYNOTE-045 trial, and is approved in the US for the 
      treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) 
      who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. Using longer follow-up and 
      individual patient-data from KEYNOTE-045, this study evaluates the 
      cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy or atezolizumab from a US payer 
      perspective.Materials and methods: A partitioned-survival model was developed over a 
      20-year time horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for pembrolizumab and 
      chemotherapy were extrapolated using a piecewise modelling approach, where 
      patient-level data from KEYNOTE-045 were used for the initial period followed by 
      parametric distributions. OS of atezolizumab was estimated by indirect treatment 
      comparisons based on KEYNOTE-045 and IMvigor211. Different scenarios were explored 
      in the absence of indirect comparisons on PFS and time-on-treatment (ToT) between 
      pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. Drug acquisition/administration, disease management, 
      adverse events, and terminal care costs were considered.Results: Compared with 
      chemotherapy, pembrolizumab resulted in a mean gain of 1.33 life-years and 1.14 
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and an incremental cost of $106,299, yielding an 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $93,481/QALY gained. Pembrolizumab dominated 
      atezolizumab in extending patients' life by 0.89 years and 0.76 QALYs, while 
      reducing costs by $26,458. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness included survival 
      extrapolation, OS hazard ratio of pembrolizumab vs. atezolizumab, and time horizon. 
      Pembrolizumab had a 66% and 100% probability of being cost-effective vs. 
      chemotherapy and atezolizumab, respectively, at a $100,000 willingness-to-pay 
      threshold.Limitations and conclusions: Uncertainties remain with extrapolated PFS 
      and OS for pembrolizumab, OS indirect comparison, and ToT for atezolizumab. Despite 
      these limitations, the model used robust methods to estimate key clinical endpoints 
      with patient-level data from longer follow-up of KEYNOTE-045. Pembrolizumab 
      dominates atezolizumab and is very likely cost-effective vs. chemotherapy in 2 L mUC 
      at a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.

TI  - Equivalence of entropy balancing and the method of moments for matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison.
PG  - 568-572
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1416 [doi]
AB  - Indirect comparisons are used to obtain estimates of relative effectiveness between 
      two treatments that have not been compared in the same randomized controlled trial, 
      but have instead been compared against a common comparator in separate trials. 
      Standard indirect comparisons use only aggregate data, under the assumption that 
      there are no differences in effect-modifying variables between the trial 
      populations. Population-adjusted indirect comparisons aim to relax this assumption 
      by using individual patient data (IPD) from one trial to adjust for differences in 
      effect modifiers between populations. At present, the most commonly used approach is 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), where weights are estimated that match 
      the covariate distributions of the reweighted IPD to the aggregate trial. MAIC was 
      originally proposed using the method of moments to estimate the weights, but more 
      recently entropy balancing has been proposed as an alternative. Entropy balancing 
      has an additional "optimality" property ensuring that the weights are as uniform as 
      possible, reducing the standard error of the estimates. In this brief method note, 
      we show that MAIC weights are mathematically identical whether estimated using 
      entropy balancing or the method of moments. Importantly, this means that the 
      standard MAIC (based on the method of moments) also enjoys the "optimality" 
      property. Moreover, the additional flexibility of entropy balancing suggests several 
      interesting avenues for further research, such as combining population adjustment 
      via MAIC with adjustments for treatment switching or nonparametric covariate 
      adjustment.

TI  - Indirect comparison of anti-interleukin 17 targeted biological treatments for 
      moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
PG  - 715-721
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.13153 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease with an 
      important disease burden worldwide and its treatment includes systemic therapies 
      which have advanced over time to target specific immune cytokines such as 
      interleukin-17. The main objective of this study was to compare the relative 
      efficacy of brodalumab, ixekizumab and secukinumab (three anti-interleukin-17 drugs) 
      through adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs). METHODS: A search was 
      carried out in June 2019, consulting these databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of 
      Science and the Cochrane Library. Studies including patients with moderate to severe 
      psoriasis randomized to receive treatment with anti-interleukin-17 drugs or 
      ustekinumab and with outcomes such as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, 
      PASI 90 and PASI 100 scores or static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA), were 
      included. ITCs were carried out using the method proposed by Bucher et al RESULTS 
      AND DISCUSSION: Five randomized clinical trials were included. Analysing short-term 
      data, there were no statistically significant differences between any pair of drugs 
      in terms of PASI 75, PASI 100 or sPGA/sIGA 0/1. Analysing long-term data, 
      statistically significant differences were only observed for secukinumab versus 
      brodalumab in terms of PASI 100 (Absolute risk reduction -12.9%; 95% confidence 
      interval -22.7% to -3.1%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The ITCs indicated no 
      efficacy differences between anti-interleukin-17 drugs, except for secukinumab 
      versus brodalumab 52-week analysis in terms of achieving PASI 100. All three drugs 
      appear to act as equivalent clinical treatments for psoriasis. However, independent 
      head-to-head trials should be carried out.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Until recently, adjuvant treatment options for stage III and IV 
      resectable melanoma have been limited. Patients were often managed through routine 
      surveillance. The phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) CheckMate 238 (238) 
      demonstrated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab as an adjuvant treatment for 
      melanoma in patients with stage IIIB/C or IV disease (American Joint Committee on 
      Cancer [AJCC], 7th edition) versus ipilimumab. The study objective was to estimate 
      the relative efficacy, safety and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between 
      nivolumab and routine surveillance. METHODS: Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) 
      of nivolumab versus placebo were constructed using data from 238 and EORTC 18071. 
      EORTC 18071 is a phase III RCT comparing ipilimumab with placebo in patients with 
      resected stage IIIA-IIIC melanoma (AJCC, 6th edition). ITCs were performed using the 
      Bucher comparison method and patient-level data for efficacy, safety and HRQoL. 
      RESULTS: For the efficacy outcomes, nivolumab performed significantly better than 
      placebo for recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53 [95% confidence 
      interval {CI}: 0.41, 0.68]) and distant metastases-free survival (HR: 0.59 [95% CI: 
      0.44, 0.78]). Safety ITCs indicated that patients receiving nivolumab had a greater 
      hazard of experiencing an adverse event (AE) and AEs leading to treatment 
      discontinuation, whereas there was a non-significant increased hazard of 
      experiencing a serious AE. HRQoL ITCs showed comparable time to deterioration in 14 
      of the 15 QLQ-C30 domains; only the dyspnoea domain significantly favoured placebo. 
      CONCLUSION: Nivolumab was associated with significantly improved efficacy outcomes 
      versus placebo, whereas maintaining patient's overall HRQoL. Across the different 
      analysis and populations, there was a high level of consistency in the effect size.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of improvement in pain and physical function for 
      baricitinib versus adalimumab, tocilizumab and tofacitinib monotherapies in 
      rheumatoid arthritis patients who are naïve to treatment with biologic or 
      conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: a matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare improvement in pain and physical function for patients treated 
      with baricitinib, adalimumab, tocilizumab and tofacitinib monotherapy from 
      randomised, methotrexate (MTX)-controlled trials in conventional synthetic 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs)/biologic (bDMARD)-naïve RA patients 
      using matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs). METHODS: Data were from Phase 
      III trials on patients receiving monotherapy baricitinib, tocilizumab, adalimumab, 
      tofacitinib or MTX. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (0-100 mm) and 
      physical function using the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index 
      (HAQ-DI). An MAIC based on treatment-arm matching, an MAIC with study-level matching 
      and Bucher's method without matching compared change in outcomes between therapies. 
      Matching variables included age, gender, baseline disease activity and baseline 
      value of outcome measure. RESULTS: With all methods, greater improvements were 
      observed in pain and HAQ-DI at 6 months for baricitinib compared with adalimumab and 
      tocilizumab (p<0.05). Differences in treatment effects (TEs) favouring baricitinib 
      for pain VAS for treatment-arm matching, study-level matching and Bucher's method, 
      respectively, were -12, -12 and -12 for baricitinib versus adalimumab and -7, -7 and 
      -9 for baricitinib versus tocilizumab; the difference in TEs for HAQ-DI was -0.28, 
      -0.28 and -0.30 for adalimumab and -0.23, -0.23 and -0.26 for tocilizumab. For 
      baricitinib versus tofacitinib, no statistically significant differences for pain 
      improvement were observed except with one of the three methods (Bucher method) and 
      none for HAQ-DI. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest greater pain reduction and improved 
      physical function for baricitinib monotherapy compared with tocilizumab and 
      adalimumab monotherapy. No statistically significant differences in pain reduction 
      and improved physical function were observed between baricitinib and tofacitinib 
      with the MAIC analyses.

TI  - Propensity score matching/reweighting analysis comparing intravenous golimumab to 
      infliximab for ankylosing spondylitis using data from the GO-ALIVE and ASSERT 
      trials.
PG  - 2907-2917
LID - 10.1007/s10067-020-05051-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative efficacy of intravenous golimumab (GOL IV) and 
      infliximab (IFX) for active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: Propensity 
      score (PS) methods were used to compare the efficacy of GOL IV 2 mg/kg and IFX 
      5 mg/kg using individual patient data (IPD) from the active arms of the phase 3 
      GO-ALIVE and ASSERT studies. Outcomes included the proportion of patients with a 
      ≥ 20% improvement in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 
      Criteria (ASAS20), change from baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional 
      Index (BASFI) score, and change from baseline in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels 
      from weeks 4-52. RESULTS: Before matching, 105 patients were treated with GOL IV and 
      201 patients were treated with IFX. After matching on all covariates, 118 patients 
      were included in the ASAS20 analysis, 96 in the BASFI analysis, and 160 in the CRP 
      analysis. After matching, GOL IV showed significantly greater improvement in ASAS20 
      response than IFX for weeks 28-44 (e.g., OR = 9.05 [95% CI 1.62-50.4] at week 44) 
      and was comparable in change from baseline in BASFI scores and CRP levels to IFX at 
      all time points. Results were robust for inclusion of different sets of covariates 
      in scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis of its kind to 
      leverage clinical trial data to compare two biologics using PS methods in the 
      treatment of active AS. Overall, GOL IV was associated with greater improvement in 
      ASAS20 response than IFX in patients with AS at 28, 36, and 44 weeks of follow-up. 
      Key Points • Although intravenous golimumab (GOL IV) and infliximab (IFX) are the 
      only two IV-based tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors with demonstrated phase 3 
      clinical efficacy in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), no study has 
      evaluated their comparative efficacy in a head-to-head trial. • Propensity score 
      matching was used to derive indirect treatment comparisons of GOL IV and IFX for 
      ≥ 20% in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society Criteria 
      (ASAS20), change in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and change 
      in C-reactive protein (CRP) using individual patient data from the GO-ALIVE and 
      ASSERT phase 3 trials. • Propensity score matched indirect comparisons showed 
      improved relative efficacy of GOL IV compared to IFX; after matching for up to 16 
      baseline covariates, GOL IV was associated with significantly greater odds of ASAS20 
      response at weeks 28, 36, and 44 than IFX as well as equivalent changes from 
      baseline in BASFI and CRP. • This novel application of propensity score matching 
      using data from phase 3 trials, the first analysis of its kind in AS, allowed 
      adjustment for important imbalances in prognostic factors between trials to generate 
      estimates of comparative efficacy between GOL IV and IFX in the absence of a 
      head-to-head trial between these treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the field of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), 
      between-trial or indirect comparisons are required to estimate relative treatment 
      effects between competing interventions based on the available evidence. Two 
      approaches are frequently used in RRMM: network meta-analysis (NMA) and unanchored 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). The objective of the current study was 
      to evaluate the relevance and credibility of published NMA and unanchored MAIC 
      studies aiming to estimate the comparative efficacy of treatment options for RRMM. 
      METHODS: Twelve relevant studies were identified in the published literature (n = 7) 
      and from health technology assessment agencies (n = 5). Data from trials were 
      extracted to identify between-trial differences that may have biased results. 
      Credibility of the performed analyses and relevance of the research questions were 
      critically appraised using the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and 
      Outcomes Research (ISPOR) checklist and feedback based on consultations with 
      clinical experts. RESULTS: The identified studies concerned NMAs of randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs; n = 7), unanchored MAICs (n = 4), or both types of analyses 
      (n = 1). According to clinical expert consultation, the majority of the identified 
      NMAs did not consider differences in prior therapies or treatment duration across 
      the RCTs included in the analyses, thereby compromising the relevance. CONCLUSION: 
      Based on the results and feedback from clinicians, the majority of NMAs did not 
      consider prior treatment history or treatment duration, which resulted in 
      nonrelevant comparisons. Furthermore, it may have compromised the credibility of the 
      estimates owing to differences in effect-modifiers between the different trials. 
      Pairwise comparisons by means of unanchored MAICs require clear justification given 
      the reliance on non-randomized comparisons.

TI  - Combined Methods (Formal Adjusted Indirect Comparison, Meta-Analysis and Principal 
      Component Analysis) Comparisons of the Safety and Efficacy of Ambrisentan, Bosentan, 
      and Sildenafil in the Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.
PG  - 400
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2020.00400 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Three oral drugs (ambrisentan, bosentan, and sildenafil) have been 
      widely used to treat patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). 1) There 
      are no studies that directly compare the safety and efficacy of these three drugs. 
      Existing studies could not meet the physician's need to select the most beneficial 
      drugs for patients. 2) Principal component analysis is mainly used for scale 
      analysis and has not been reported in clinical field. 3) When the results of the 
      indirect meta-analysis were not satisfactory, no new solutions have been proposed in 
      existing meta-analysis studies. METHODS: The overall process of this study is 
      divided into 4 steps 1) literature search and data extraction; 2) principal 
      component analysis; 3) common reference-based indirect comparison meta-analysis; 4) 
      formal adjusted indirect comparison. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) experiments and eight long-term experiments were selected. The main 
      influencing factors are mortality, 6-min walk distance (6MW), mean pulmonary 
      arterial pressure (PAP), cardiac index (CI) by principal component analysis. There 
      was no significant heterogeneity among the indirect meta-analysis of three drugs. 
      But in the formal adjusted indirect comparison 1) the level of PAP of sildenafil 
      group (60.5 ± 22.35, 220) was higher than that of the other three groups, placebo 
      (53.5 ± 17.63, 507) (p < 0.001), ambrisentan (49.5 ± 15.08, 130) (p < 0.001), and 
      bosentan (54.6 ± 118.41, 311) (p < 0.001); 2) the level of CI of sildenafil group 
      (54 ± 18, 311) was higher than that of the other three groups, placebo (2.7 ± 1.09, 
      518) (p < 0.001), ambrisentan (2.5 ± 0.75, 130) (p < 0.001), and bosentan (2.5 ± 
      1.06, 333) (p < 0.001). In addition, sildenafil significantly improved the survival 
      rate comparing with ambrisentan and bosentan. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study 
      suggest that sildenafil might be more suitable for long-term treatment of PAH 
      patients than ambrisentan and bosentan. In order to enable clinicians to draw 
      conclusions more quickly and directly in the data-rich literature, we suggest the 
      use of principal component analysis combined with formal adjusted indirect 
      comparison to compare the efficacy and safety of drugs.

TI  - Reweighting Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence to Better Reflect Real Life - A 
      Case Study of the Innovative Medicines Initiative.
PG  - 817-825
LID - 10.1002/cpt.1854 [doi]
AB  - Evidence from randomized controlled trials available for timely health technology 
      assessments of new pharmacological treatments and regulatory decision making may not 
      be generalizable to local patient populations, often resulting in decisions being 
      made under uncertainty. In recent years, several reweighting approaches have been 
      explored to address this important question of generalizability to a target 
      population. We present a case study of the Innovative Medicines Initiative to 
      illustrate the inverse propensity score reweighting methodology, which may allow us 
      to estimate the expected treatment benefit if a clinical trial had been run in a 
      broader real-world target population. We learned that identifying treatment effect 
      modifiers, understanding and managing differences between patient characteristic 
      data sets, and balancing the closeness of trial and target patient populations with 
      effective sample size are key to successfully using this methodology and potentially 
      mitigating some of this uncertainty around local decision making.

TI  - Indirect comparisons of ixekizumab versus three interleukin-23 p19 inhibitors in 
      patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis - efficacy findings up to week 12.
PG  - 54-61
LID - 10.1080/09546634.2020.1747592 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is challenging to select the most appropriate biologic treatment for 
      patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To compare speed of 
      onset and level of skin improvement between the interleukin (IL)-17A antagonist 
      ixekizumab and the IL-23 p19 inhibitors guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab 
      in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Using data from 
      controlled clinical trials, both adjusted indirect comparisons (AICs) and matching 
      adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) were performed to determine the risk 
      difference (RD) between ixekizumab and each IL-23 p19 inhibitor for the proportion 
      of patients with ≥75%/90%/100% improvement compared with baseline in Psoriasis Area 
      and Severity Index (PASI 75/90/100) up to week 12. Placebo, etanercept, or 
      ustekinumab were used as the comparator bridge. RESULTS: In all (M)AICs, RDs 
      generally significantly favored ixekizumab over guselkumab (placebo bridge), 
      tildrakizumab (placebo or etanercept bridge), and risankizumab (placebo or 
      ustekinumab bridge) from the earliest assessment time (≥ week 2) to week 12 when 
      considering PASI 75/90/100 responses. CONCLUSION: Ixekizumab provides a faster onset 
      of effect and earlier clinical benefits than guselkumab, tildrakizumab, or 
      risankizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, as reflected by higher 
      levels of skin improvement than with these IL-23 p19 inhibitors up to week 12.

TI  - Brigatinib and Alectinib for ALK Rearrangement-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung 
      Cancer With or Without Central Nervous System Metastasis: A Systematic Review and 
      Network Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/cancers12040942 [doi]
LID - 942
AB  - To date, no head-to-head trials have compared the efficacy of brigatinib and 
      alectinib against anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement-positive (ALK-p), 
      ALK-inhibitor-naïve, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with central 
      nervous system (CNS) metastasis. We conducted an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) 
      between brigatinib and alectinib, with crizotinib as a common comparator, using a 
      Bayesian model with non-informative prior distribution and assessed the 
      between-study heterogeneity of the studies. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
      progression-free survival (PFS), and efficacy was ranked using the surface under the 
      cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve values. ITC analysis showed that there were no 
      significant differences in PFS between the brigatinib and alectinib arms. However, 
      the SUCRA values revealed that alectinib ranked the highest by efficacy in the 
      overall patient population, whereas brigatinib ranked the highest by efficacy in the 
      CNS metastasis sub-group. Although there were no significant differences in the 
      incidence of G3-5 adverse events between the brigatinib and alectinib arms in the 
      overall patient population, the data were deemed insufficient for the CNS metastasis 
      sub-group analysis. This study provides critical information to clinicians regarding 
      the efficacy of brigatinib for ALK-p, ALK-inhibitor-naïve, advanced NSCLC patients, 
      with and without CNS metastasis. Larger randomized, controlled trials are warranted 
      to confirm our results.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (VMP) is the standard of care 
      for transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The phase III VISTA 
      trial established the bortezomib dosing schedule for VMP. To mitigate 
      bortezomib-associated toxicity, the phase III ALCYONE study of daratumumab plus VMP 
      (D-VMP) versus VMP used modified bortezomib dosing. D-VMP demonstrated improved 
      progression-free survival and overall response rate. Propensity score matching 
      enables indirect comparisons by controlling for differences in baseline covariates. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: The efficacy and safety of both arms of ALCYONE were compared 
      with VISTA VMP using propensity score matching. ALCYONE D-VMP and VMP patients were 
      matched on selected baseline characteristics to VISTA VMP patients, reducing or 
      eliminating systematic differences between treatment groups. RESULTS: After 
      matching, median progression-free survival and overall response rate were comparable 
      for ALCYONE VMP and VISTA VMP, and were significantly improved with ALCYONE D-VMP 
      versus VISTA VMP. Rates of grade 3/4 peripheral sensory neuropathy were 
      significantly lower for both arms of ALCYONE versus VISTA VMP, with or without 
      matching. CONCLUSION: This propensity score matching analysis demonstrates 
      significant improvements in efficacy with ALCYONE D-VMP versus VISTA VMP and a 
      significantly lower incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy in both arms of 
      ALCYONE versus VISTA VMP, although safety improvements may be due to different 
      bortezomib administration routes (ALCYONE, subcutaneous; VISTA, intravenous).

TI  - The impact of intra-abdominal pressure on perioperative outcomes in laparoscopic 
      cholecystectomy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized 
      controlled trials.
PG  - 2878-2890
LID - 10.1007/s00464-020-07527-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves using intra-abdominal pressure 
      (IAP) to facilitate adequate surgical conditions. However, there is no consensus on 
      optimal IAP levels to improve surgical outcomes. Therefore, we conducted a 
      systematic literature review (SLR) to examine outcomes of low, standard, and high 
      IAP among adults undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: An electronic 
      database search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that 
      compared outcomes of low, standard, and high IAP among adults undergoing 
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to 
      conduct pairwise meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons of the levels of 
      IAP assessed across trials. RESULTS: The SLR and NMA included 22 studies. Compared 
      with standard IAP, on a scale of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain), 
      low IAP was associated with significantly lower overall pain scores at 24 h (mean 
      difference [MD]: - 0.70; 95% credible interval [CrI]: - 1.26, - 0.13) and reduced 
      risk of shoulder pain 24 h (odds ratio [OR] 0.24; 95% CrI 0.12, 0.48) and 72 h 
      post-surgery (OR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.07, 0.65). Hospital stay was shorter with low IAP 
      (MD: - 0.14 days; 95% CrI - 0.30, - 0.01). High IAP was not associated with a 
      significant difference for these outcomes when compared with standard or low IAP. No 
      significant differences were found between the IAP levels regarding need for 
      conversion to open surgery; post-operative acute bleeding, pain at 72 h, nausea, and 
      vomiting; and duration of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of published trials 
      indicates that using low, as opposed to standard, IAP during laparoscopic 
      cholecystectomy may reduce patients' post-operative pain, including shoulder pain, 
      and length of hospital stay. Heterogeneity in the pooled estimates and high risk of 
      bias of the included trials suggest the need for high-quality, adequately powered 
      RCTs to confirm these findings.

TI  - Efficacy and Treatment Burden of Intravitreal Aflibercept Versus Intravitreal 
      Ranibizumab Treat-and-Extend Regimens at 2 Years: Network Meta-Analysis 
      Incorporating Individual Patient Data Meta-Regression and Matching-Adjusted Indirect 
      Comparison.
PG  - 2184-2198
LID - 10.1007/s12325-020-01298-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare visual outcomes and treatment burden between intravitreally 
      administered aflibercept (IVT-AFL) and ranibizumab (RBZ) treat-and-extend (T&E) 
      regimens in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) at 2 years. 
      METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out in Medline, EMBASE, and 
      CENTRAL in October 2018. Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) and/or 
      individual patient data meta-regression was used to connect ALTAIR (assessing 
      IVT-AFL T&E) with other studies, adjusting for between-trial differences in baseline 
      visual acuity and age or baseline visual acuity, age, and polypoidal choroidal 
      vasculopathy (PCV) status. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the 
      robustness of the results, including direct MAIC between IVT-AFL T&E (ALTAIR) and 
      RBZ T&E (CANTREAT and TREX-AMD trials). RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) (ALTAIR, VIEW 1 and 2, CATT, CANTREAT, and TREX) were included in the 
      analysis. IVT-AFL T&E was assessed in one study, ALTAIR (n = 255), while RBZ T&E was 
      assessed in two trials (n = 327). At 2 years, the median difference (95% credibility 
      interval) between IVT-AFL T&E and RBZ T&E regarding the numbers of Early Treatment 
      Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters gained was not significant (M1: - 2.29 
      [- 8.10, 3.58]; M2: - 0.55 [- 6.34, 5.29]). IVT-AFL T&E was associated with 
      significantly fewer injections than RBZ-T&E (M1: - 6.12 [- 7.60, - 4.65]; M2: - 5.93 
      [- 7.42, - 4.45]). Results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main 
      scenarios. CONCLUSION: Patients with wAMD receiving an IVT-AFL T&E regimen achieved 
      and maintained improvement in visual acuity with fewer injections over 2 years 
      compared with RBZ T&E. IVT-AFL T&E may therefore serve as the optimal therapy for 
      wAMD, as it was associated with clinical efficacy and minimized treatment burden.

TI  - A putative placebo analysis of the effects of sacubitril/valsartan in heart failure 
      across the full range of ejection fraction.
PG  - 2356-2362
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa184 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF trials tested sacubitril/valsartan against 
      active controls given renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) are ethically 
      mandated in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction and are used in the 
      vast majority of patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction. To estimate the 
      effects of sacubitril/valsartan had it been tested against a placebo control, we 
      made indirect comparisons of the effects of sacubitril/valsartan with putative 
      placebos in HF across the full range of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed patient-level data from the PARADIGM-HF and 
      PARAGON-HF trials (n = 13 194) and the CHARM-Alternative and CHARM-Preserved trials 
      (n = 5050, candesartan vs. placebo). The rate ratio (RR) of sacubitril/valsartan vs. 
      putative placebo was estimated by the product of the RR for sacubitril/valsartan vs. 
      RASi and the RR for RASi vs. placebo. Total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular 
      death were analysed using the negative binomial method. Treatment effects were 
      estimated using cubic spline methods by ejection fraction as a continuous measure. 
      Across the range of LVEF, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with a RR 0.54 [95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.65] for the recurrent primary endpoint compared with 
      putative placebo (P < 0.001). Treatment benefits of sacubitril/valsartan vs. 
      putative placebo varied non-linearly with LVEF with attenuation of effects observed 
      at LVEF above 60%. When analyzing data from PARADIGM-HF and CHARM-Alternative, the 
      estimated risk reduction of sacubitril/valsartan vs. putative placebo was 48% (95% 
      CI 35-58%); P < 0.001. When analyzing data from PARAGON-HF and CHARM-Preserved (with 
      LVEF ≥ 45%), the estimated risk reduction of sacubitril/valsartan vs. putative 
      placebo was 29% (95% CI 7-46%); P = 0.013. Across the full range of LVEF, consistent 
      effects were observed for time-to-first endpoints: first primary endpoint (RR 0.72, 
      95% CI 0.64-0.82), first HF hospitalization (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78), 
      cardiovascular death (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.89), and all-cause death (RR 0.83, 95% 
      CI 0.71-0.96); all P < 0.02. CONCLUSION: This putative placebo analysis reinforces 
      the treatment benefits of sacubitril/valsartan on risk of adverse cardiovascular 
      events across the full range of LVEF, with most pronounced effects observed at a 
      LVEF up to 60%.

AB  - Background: Siponimod, interferon beta-1a (IFNβ-1a), IFNβ-1b and natalizumab have 
      been evaluated as treatments for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) in 
      separate randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but not head-to-head. These trials 
      included heterogeneous patient populations, which limits the use of standard network 
      meta-analysis (NMA) for indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of relative efficacy. 
      Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) aims to correct these cross-trial 
      differences. We compared siponimod to other disease modifying treatments (DMTs) in 
      SPMS using MAIC.Methods: Individual patient data (IPD) were available for siponimod 
      (EXPAND), while only published summary data were available for IFNβ-1a (Nordic 
      Study, SPECTRIMS, IMPACT), IFNβ-1b (North American Study, European Study) and 
      natalizumab (ASCEND). MAICs were conducted between siponimod and the other DMTs by 
      re-weighting patients in EXPAND based on logistic regression.Results: Siponimod was 
      determined to be statistically significantly more effective for the outcome of time 
      to 6 month confirmed disability progression (CDP) compared with 22 µg IFNβ-1a and 
      250 µg IFNβ-1b, and for the outcome of time to CDP-3 compared with 60 µg IFNβ-1a. 
      Siponimod was numerically but not statistically superior for CDP in all other 
      comparisons. For annualized relapse rate (ARR), with the exception of natalizumab, 
      siponimod was numerically but not statistically superior to all 
      comparators.Conclusions: EXPAND provides evidence of the efficacy of siponimod 
      compared with placebo, and these MAICs complement this by demonstrating improved 
      efficacy of siponimod relative to DMTs. Siponimod offers a significant therapeutic 
      advance that may slow disease progression compared to other DMTs in an EXPAND-like 
      population with secondary progressive disease.

TI  - The importance of considering differences in study and patient characteristics 
      before undertaking indirect treatment comparisons: a case study of siponimod for 
      secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 1145-1156
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2020.1747998 [doi]
AB  - Background: Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) provide valuable evidence on 
      comparative efficacy where head-to-head clinical trials do not exist; however, 
      differences in patient populations may introduce bias. Therefore, it is essential to 
      assess between-trial heterogeneity to determine the suitability of synthesizing ITC 
      results. We provide an illustrative case study in multiple sclerosis (MS) where we 
      assess the feasibility of conducting ITCs between siponimod and interferon beta-1b 
      (IFN β-1b) and between siponimod and ocrelizumab.Methods: We assessed the 
      feasibility of conducting ITCs using standard unadjusted methods (e.g. Bucher or 
      network meta-analysis [NMA]) as well as matching-adjusted indirect comparisons 
      (MAICs) using individual patient data (IPD) from the siponimod (EXPAND) trial, based 
      on guidance from NICE. Time to confirmed disability progression (CDP) at 3 or 
      6 months was assessed.Results: Bucher ITCs and NMAs, which rely on summary-level 
      data, were not able to account for important cross-trial differences. Comparisons 
      between siponimod and IFN β-1b were feasible using MAIC; the HRs (95% CI) for CDP-6 
      and CDP-3 were 0.55 (0.33-0.91) and 0.82 (0.42-1.63), respectively. ITCs were not 
      feasible between siponimod and ocrelizumab because study designs and patient 
      populations were too dissimilar to conduct a reliable ITC.Conclusions: This study 
      highlights the importance of conducting a detailed feasibility assessment before 
      undertaking ITCs to illuminate when excessive between-trial heterogeneity would 
      cause biased results. MAIC was performed for siponimod and IFN β-1b in the absence 
      of a head-to-head trial and was considered a more valid approach than a traditional 
      ITC to examine comparative effectiveness.

TI  - A patient-level cost-effectiveness analysis of iron isomaltoside versus ferric 
      carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in the United Kingdom.
PG  - 751-759
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2020.1745535 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Intravenous iron is the recommended treatment for patients with iron 
      deficiency anemia (IDA) where oral iron is ineffective or rapid iron replenishment 
      is required. Two high-dose, rapid-administration intravenous iron formulations are 
      currently available in the UK: iron isomaltoside 1000/ferric derisomaltose (IIM) and 
      ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). An indirect treatment comparison (ITC) recently showed 
      that improvement from baseline hemoglobin was significantly larger with IIM than 
      FCM. The objective was to use the ITC findings to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
      IIM versus FCM from the UK healthcare payer perspective.Methods: A patient-level 
      simulation model was developed in R to evaluate the cost per patient experiencing 
      hematological response with IIM versus FCM. The model generated a simulated cohort 
      from parametric distributions of baseline hemoglobin and bodyweight. Changes in 
      hemoglobin were modeled based on data from the ITC, covaried with baseline 
      hemoglobin based on patient-level data from a randomized controlled trial. 
      Posological models of the iron formulations were developed based on the summaries of 
      product characteristics. UK-specific costs were based on healthcare resource 
      groups.Results: The proportion of patients experiencing hematological response was 
      9.0% higher with IIM relative to FCM (79.0% versus 70.0%), based on modeling of 
      clinically realistic, correlated distributions of baseline hemoglobin and change 
      from baseline hemoglobin. The mean number of infusions needed to administer the 
      required dose was 1.92 with FCM, versus 1.38 with IIM, resulting in costs of £637 
      and £457 per treated patient with FCM and IIM respectively, corresponding to 
      respective costs of £910 and £579 per responder.Conclusions: The analysis showed 
      that using IIM rather than FCM in patients with IDA was dominant and would reduce 
      the number of iron infusions required to correct iron deficiency, thereby reducing 
      the costs associated with IDA treatment and simultaneously increasing the proportion 
      of patients with IDA experiencing a clinically meaningful hematological response.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of Brexanolone Versus Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors for 
      the Treatment of Postpartum Depression in the United States.
PG  - 627-638
LID - 10.18553/jmcp.2020.19306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brexanolone injection (BRX) was approved by the FDA in 2019 for the 
      treatment of adult patients with postpartum depression (PPD), but its 
      cost-effectiveness has not yet been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the 
      cost-effectiveness of BRX compared with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs) for PPD. METHODS: We projected costs (2018 U.S. dollars) and 
      health (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) for mothers treated with BRX or SSRIs 
      and their children. A health state transition model projected clinical and economic 
      outcomes for mothers based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, from a U.S. 
      payer perspective. The modeled population consisted of adult patients with moderate 
      to severe PPD, similar to BRX clinical trial patients. Short-term efficacy for BRX 
      and SSRIs came from an indirect treatment comparison. Long-term efficacy outcomes 
      over 4 weeks, 11 years (base case), and 18 years were based on results from an 
      18-year longitudinal study. Maternal health utility values came from analysis of 
      trial-based short-form 6D responses. Other inputs were derived from the literature. 
      RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for BRX versus SSRIs was $106,662 
      per QALY gained over an 11-year time horizon. Drug and administration costs for BRX 
      averaged $38,501, compared with $25 for SSRIs over the studied time horizon. 
      Maternal total direct medical costs averaged $65,908 in the BRX arm, compared with 
      $73,653 in the SSRI arm. BRX-treated women averaged 6.230 QALYs compared with 5.979 
      QALYs for the SSRI arm. Adding partner costs and utilities in a sensitivity analysis 
      further favored BRX. Results were sensitive to the severity of PPD at baseline and 
      the model time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that BRX was 
      cost-effective at the $150,000-per-QALY threshold with 58% probability. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Analysis using a state transition model showed BRX to be a cost-effective therapy 
      compared with SSRIs for treating women with PPD. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded

AB  - BACKGROUND: The DNA hypomethylating agents (HMAs) decitabine and azacitidine have 
      been widely used in the management of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia 
      (AML). However, no direct clinical trials have been carried out to compare the two 
      agents. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were performed to indirectly 
      compare the efficacy and safety of decitabine and azacitidine in elderly AML 
      patients. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, 
      Embase and Cochrane Library through May 14, 2019. Randomized controlled trials on 
      elderly AML patients comparing the efficacy and safety between decitabine and 
      azacitidine, or comparing one of HMAs to standard supportive care or placebo were 
      selected. The major outcomes of interest were performed with methods of adjusted 
      indirect comparison and the fixed effect model. RESULTS: Only three RCTs including a 
      total number of 1086 patients were identified. Direct comparisons showed that 
      azacitidine significantly reduced mortality (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97) while 
      decitabine was not significantly associated with lower mortality (RR = 0.97, 95% CI 
      0.92-1.02) compared to the conventional care regimen (CCR). In addition, for the 
      indirect method, azacitidine significantly reduced mortality compared to decitabine 
      (RR = 0.83 95% CI 0.77-0.90) and was more likely to improve complete response (CR) 
      (RR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.17-2.35, low-certainty evidence). No statistical significance 
      was found for the other studied outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to CCR, decitabine 
      and azacitidine can promote studied outcomes in elderly AML patients. Indirect 
      evidence with low certainty was used to compare these two agents. The superiority of 
      either agent cannot be confirmed, and head-to-head clinical trials are still

TI  - Comparative efficacy and cost-utility of combined cataract and minimally invasive 
      glaucoma surgery in primary open-angle glaucoma.
PG  - 1469-1479
LID - 10.1007/s10792-020-01314-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the comparative efficacy and the long-term cost-utility of 
      alternative minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGSs) when combined with 
      cataract surgery in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). METHODS: 
      Treatment effects, as measured by the 1-year reduction in intraocular pressure 
      (IOP), were estimated with an adjusted indirect treatment comparison. Evidence from 
      randomized clinical trials was identified for four different MIGS methods. A 
      disease-transition model was developed by capturing clinically relevant POAG stages 
      and the expected natural disease evolution. Outcomes of the disease-transition model 
      were the comparative utility [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)], cost and 
      cost-utility of included strategies in a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: Estimated 1-year 
      IOP reductions were: cataract surgery - 2.05 mmHg (95% CI - 3.38; - 0.72), one 
      trabecular micro-bypass stent - 3.15 mmHg (95% CI - 5.66; - 0.64), two trabecular 
      micro-bypass stents - 4.85 mmHg (95% CI - 7.71; - 1.99) and intracanalicular 
      scaffold - 2.25 mmHg (95% CI - 4.87; 0.37). Discounted outcomes from the 
      disease-transition model appraised the strategy of two trabecular micro-bypass 
      stents with cataract surgery in the moderate POAG stage as the one providing the 
      greatest added value, with 10,955€ per additional QALY. Improved outcomes were seen 
      when assessing MIGS in the moderate POAG stage. CONCLUSIONS: When indirectly 
      comparing alternative MIGS methods combined with cataract surgery, the option of two 
      trabecular micro-bypass stents showed both a superior efficacy and long-term 
      cost-utility from a German perspective. Moreover, outcomes of the disease-transition 
      model suggest POAG patients to beneficiate the most from an earlier intervention in 
      the moderate stage contrary to waiting until an advanced disease is present.

TI  - Assessing the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic 
      VSL#3 for active ulcerative colitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e0228846
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0228846 [doi]
LID - e0228846
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota transplantation is an effective treatment for many 
      gastrointestinal diseases, such as Clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory 
      bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis. Changes in colonic microflora may play 
      an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and improvements in the 
      intestinal microflora may relieve the disease. Fecal bacterial transplants and oral 
      probiotics are becoming important ways to relieve active ulcerative colitis. 
      PURPOSE: This systematic review with meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety 
      of basic treatment combined with fecal microbiota transplantation or mixed 
      probiotics therapy in relieving mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The 
      PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane libraries (updated September 2019) were searched to 
      identify randomized, placebo-controlled, or head-to-head trials assessing fecal 
      microbiota transplantation or probiotic VSL#3 as induction therapy in active 
      ulcerative colitis. We analyze data using the R program to obtain evidence of direct 
      comparison and to generate intermediate variables for indirect treatment 
      comparisons. RESULTS: Seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were 
      used as the sources of the induction data. All treatments were superior to placebo. 
      In terms of clinical remission and clinical response to active ulcerative colitis, 
      direct comparisons showed fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 3.47, 95% CI = 
      1.93-6.25) (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.18-5.21) and mixed probiotics VSL#3 (OR = 2.40, 
      95% CI = 1.49-3.88) (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.53-6.25) to have better effects than the 
      placebo. Indirect comparison showed fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic 
      VSL#3 did not reach statistical significance either in clinical remission (RR = 
      1.20, 95% CI = 0.70-2.06) or clinical response (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.62-1.45). In 
      terms of safety, fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.51-2.61) 
      and VSL #3 (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.33-2.49) showed no statistically significant 
      increase in adverse events compared with the control group. In terms of serious 
      adverse events, there was no statistical difference between the fecal microbiota 
      transplantation group and the control group (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.46-3.57). The 
      probiotics VSL#3 seems more safer than fecal microbiota transplantation, because 
      serious adverse events were not reported in the VSL#3 articles. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal 
      microbiota transplantation or mixed probiotics VSL#3 achieved good results in 
      clinical remission and clinical response in active ulcerative colitis, and there was 
      no increased risk of adverse reactions. There was no statistical difference between 
      the therapeutic effect of fecal microbiota transplantation and that of mixed 
      probiotics VSL#3. However, the use of fecal microbiota transplantation and 
      probiotics still has many unresolved problems in clinical applications, and more 
      randomized controlled trials are required to confirm its efficacy.

TI  - Accelerated convergence extended ptychographical iterative engine using multiple 
      axial intensity constraints.
PG  - 3587-3597
LID - 10.1364/OE.386152 [doi]
AB  - The extended ptychographical iterative engine (ePIE) is widely applied in the field 
      of ptychographic imaging due to its great flexibility and computational efficiency. 
      A technique of ePIE with multiple axial intensity constraints, which is called 
      MAIC-PIE, is proposed to drastically improve the convergence speed and reduce the 
      calculation time. This technique requires that the diffracted light from the sample 
      is propagated to the multiple individual axial planes, which can be achieved by 
      using the beam splitter and multiple CCDs. In this technique, an additional 
      intensity constraint is involved in the iterative process that makes for building 
      the reasonable guesses of the probe and object in the first few iterations and 
      accelerating the convergence. Simulations and experiments have verified that 
      MAIC-PIE behaves good performance with fast convergence. The great performance and 
      limited computational complexity make it a very attractive and promising technique 
      for ptychographic imaging.

TI  - Combination of several matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) with an 
      application in psoriasis.
PG  - 532-540
LID - 10.1002/pst.2011 [doi]
AB  - In health technology assessment (HTA), beside network meta-analysis (NMA), indirect 
      comparisons (IC) have become an important tool used to provide evidence between two 
      treatments when no head-to-head data are available. Researchers may use the adjusted 
      indirect comparison based on the Bucher method (AIC) or the matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison (MAIC). While the Bucher method may provide biased results when 
      included trials differ in baseline characteristics that influence the treatment 
      outcome (treatment effect modifier), this issue may be addressed by applying the 
      MAIC method if individual patient data (IPD) for at least one part of the AIC is 
      available. Here, IPD is reweighted to match baseline characteristics and/or 
      treatment effect modifiers of published data. However, the MAIC method does not 
      provide a solution for situations when several common comparators are available. In 
      these situations, assuming that the indirect comparison via the different common 
      comparators is homogeneous, we propose merging these results by using meta-analysis 
      methodology to provide a single, potentially more precise, treatment effect 
      estimate. This paper introduces the method to combine several MAIC networks using 
      classic meta-analysis techniques, it discusses the advantages and limitations of 
      this approach, as well as demonstrates a practical application to combine several 
      (M)AIC networks using data from Phase III psoriasis randomized control trials (RCT).

      considerations and guidelines.

AB  - Single-arm studies are sometimes used as pivotal studies but they have 
      methodological limitations which prevent them from obtaining the high level of 
      reliability as for a randomised controlled study which remains the gold standard in 
      the evaluation of new treatments. The objective of this roundtable was to discuss 
      the limitations of these single-arm studies, to analyse available and acceptable 
      solutions in order to propose guidelines for their conduct and assessment. 
      Single-arm studies themselves are intrinsically inappropriate for demonstrating the 
      benefit of a new treatment because it is impossible to infer the benefit from a 
      value obtained under treatment without knowing what it would have been in the 
      absence of the new treatment. The implication is that comparison with other data is 
      necessary. However this comparison has limitations due to (1) the post hoc choice of 
      the reference used for comparison, (2) the confusion bias for which an adjustment 
      approach is imperative and, (3) the other biases, measure and attrition among 
      others. When these limitations are taken into account this should, first and 
      foremost, lead to the conduct of externally controlled trials instead of single-arm 
      trials as is proposed by the latest version of ICH E10. Moreover, the external 
      control must be formalised in the study protocol with a priori selection of both the 
      reference control and the formal method of comparison: test in relation to a 
      standard, adjustment on individual data, a synthetic control group or 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC). Lastly, externally controlled studies 
      must be restricted to situations where randomisation is infeasible. To be 
      acceptable, these studies must be able to guarantee freedom from residual confusion 
      bias, which is only truly acceptable if the observed effect is dramatic and the 
      usual course of the disease is highly predicable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of stent-related major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are believed to occur within the 
      first year. Very-late (>1-year) stent-related MACE have not been well described. 
      OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency and predictors of 
      very-late stent-related events or MACE by stent type. METHODS: Individual patient 
      data from 19 prospective, randomized metallic stent trials maintained at a leading 
      academic research organization were pooled. Very-late MACE (a composite of cardiac 
      death, myocardial infarction [MI], or ischemia-driven target lesion 
      revascularization [ID-TLR]), and target lesion failure (cardiac death, target-vessel 
      MI, or ID-TLR) were assessed within year 1 and between 1 and 5 years after PCI with 
      bare-metal stents (BMS), first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES1) and 
      second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES2). A network meta-analysis was performed 
      to evaluate direct and indirect comparisons. RESULTS: Among 25,032 total patients, 
      3,718, 7,934, and 13,380 were treated with BMS, DES1, and DES2, respectively. MACE 
      rates within 1 year after PCI were progressively lower after treatment with BMS 
      versus DES1 versus DES2 (17.9% vs. 8.2% vs. 5.1%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Between 
      years 1 and 5, very-late MACE occurred in 9.4% of patients (including 2.9% cardiac 
      death, 3.1% MI, and 5.1% ID-TLR). Very-late MACE occurred in 9.7%, 11.0%, and 8.3% 
      of patients treated with BMS, DES1, and DES2, respectively (p < 0.0001), linearly 
      increasing between 1 and 5 years. Similar findings were observed for target lesion 
      failure in 19,578 patients from 12 trials. Findings were confirmed in the network 
      meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale, individual patient data pooled 
      study, very-late stent-related events occurred between 1 and 5 years after PCI at a 
      rate of ∼2%/year with all stent types, with no plateau evident. New approaches 
      are required to improve long-term outcomes after PCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a kind of chronic and recurrent mental disorder, the main 
      clinical characteristics of the patients are marked and persistent depression. At 
      the same time, it is often accompanied by chronic physical disease, cognitive 
      impairment, and functional damage, which is one of the common diseases that 
      seriously threaten human health. At present, 3 kinds of oral Chinese patent medicine 
      have clinical comparability in the treatment of depression of liver stagnation and 
      spleen deficiency, but there is no evidence for clinical efficacy and safety. 
      Therefore, this study aims to integrate the clinical related syndromes of direct and 
      indirect comparison by using systematic evaluation and network meta-analysis (NMA). 
      According to the data, the different Chinese patent medicines with the same evidence 
      body for the treatment of the disease are collected, analyzed, and sequenced in a 
      quantitative and comprehensive way, and then the advantages and disadvantages of the 
      efficacy and safety between different Chinese patent medicines are screened out to 
      get the best choice scheme, thus providing reference value and evidence-based 
      theoretical evidence for the clinical optimization of drug selection. METHODS: 
      Comprehensive retrieval of China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese 
      scientific journal database (VIP), China biological feature database (CBM) and 
      WANFANG Data Chinese electronic database and the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of 
      Science, and EMBASE foreign database. Search and publish the clinical randomized 
      controlled trials of these 3 Chinese patent medicines combined with fluoxetine 
      compared with fluoxetine. The retrieval time is from the establishment of the 
      database to October 31, 2019. The 2 first authors will screen the literatures that 
      meet the inclusion criteria, extract the data independently according to the 
      predesigned rules, and evaluate the literature quality and bias risk of the included 
      research according to the Cochrane 5.1 manual standard. R and Aggregate Data Drug 
      Information System software were used for data consolidation and NMA to evaluate the 
      ranking probability of all interventions. RESULTS: This result will show that the 
      best oral Chinese patent medicine to assist the treatment of liver stagnation and 
      spleen deficiency depression provides reliable evidence. CONCLUSION: This study will 
      provide systematic evidence-based medicine evidence for TCM assisted treatment of 
      depression of liver stagnation and spleen deficiency type, and help clinicians, 
      patients with depression and decision-makers to make more effective, safer, and 
      economic optimal treatment plan in the decision-making process. PROSPERO

TI  - Comparative Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab and Benralizumab in Patients with 
      Inadequately Controlled Asthma: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21030889 [doi]
LID - 889
AB  - No head-to-head trials have compared the efficacy and safety between the licensed 
      dosage and administration dosage of dupilumab and benralizumab for inadequately 
      controlled asthma. We conducted an indirect treatment comparison to estimate 
      differences in the efficacy and safety between dupilumab and benralizumab for 
      inadequately controlled asthma using the Bayesian approach. The primary efficacy 
      endpoint was annual exacerbation rate (AER). A subgroup analysis by blood eosinophil 
      count was also performed. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of any 
      adverse events (AAEs). The results demonstrate that there was no significant 
      difference in the AER between dupilumab and benralizumab in overall patients and the 
      subgroup with the blood eosinophil count of <150. However, the AER was significantly 
      lower in the dupilumab group than in the benralizumab group in the subgroup with a 
      blood eosinophil count of ≥150 but <300, and ≥300 with the rate ratio and 95% 
      credible interval of 0.51 (0.29-0.92) and 0.58 (0.39-0.84), respectively. There was 
      no significant difference in the AAEs between the dupilumab and benralizumab groups. 
      This indirect treatment comparison indicates that dupilumab is superior to 
      benralizumab in patients with inadequately controlled asthma having higher blood 
      eosinophil counts. A direct comparison is required to provide definitive evidence.

PG  - 799-808
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2020.1725742 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The comparative safety and efficacy of tafamidis, patisiran and inotersen 
      treatments for transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) has not been 
      evaluated in clinical trials. In the absence of head-to-head evidence, indirect 
      treatment comparisons such as network meta-analyses (NMAs) can be performed to 
      evaluate relative effects of treatments. This study aims to assess the feasibility 
      of conducting an NMA of available therapies for ATTR-PN patients.Methods: Pivotal 
      trials for three approved ATTR-PN treatments, tafamidis (Fx-005), patisiran (APOLLO) 
      and inotersen (NEURO-TTR), were compared in terms of study design, baseline 
      population characteristics, outcome definitions and baseline risk. These assessments 
      of heterogeneity informed the decision to perform Bayesian NMAs.Results: Despite 
      similar study designs, clear differences in eligibility criteria between trials were 
      accompanied by imbalances in baseline population characteristics considered to be 
      plausible effect modifiers, such as disease stage and previous treatment. Of the 
      outcomes assessed, only quality of life and adverse events were similarly reported 
      in all trials. Neuropathy outcomes were not evaluated consistently between 
      trials.Conclusions: An NMA of ATTR-PN treatments was not feasible, given the 
      observed cross-trial heterogeneity. This decision highlights the importance of 
      careful consideration for clinical heterogeneity that may threaten the validity of 
      indirect comparisons.

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells represent a potent new approach to treat 
      haematological malignancies. Two CAR T-cell therapies, tisagenlecleucel and 
      axicabtagene ciloleucel, have been approved in Europe and the USA, as well as 
      several other countries, for the treatment of leukaemia and lymphoma. These 
      approvals marked a major milestone in the field of cell and gene therapies. However, 
      the clinical development and regulatory evaluation of these innovative therapies 
      faced several challenges that are considered important lessons learned for future 
      similar products. Here, we examine the products' non-clinical and clinical data 
      packages to outline the challenges encountered during the regulatory evaluation 
      process in Europe, and to provide an update on their performance after 
      authorisation.

      calcipotriene 0.005%/betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% foam vs. halobetasol 
      0.01%/tazarotene 0.045% lotion for plaque psoriasis: a matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparative analysis.
PG  - 641-649
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2020.1722139 [doi]
AB  - Background: The fixed-dose combination foam formulation of calcipotriene 0.005% plus 
      betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% (Cal/BD) has demonstrated efficacy and a favorable 
      safety profile for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Recently, a topical lotion of 
      the combination of halobetasol 0.01% plus tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) was approved 
      for treating adult plaque psoriasis. Currently, no head-to-head studies have 
      compared Cal/BD foam with HP/TAZ lotion.Objective: Compare the effectiveness and 
      drug incremental cost per responder (ICPR) of Cal/BD foam vs. HP/TAZ lotion in 
      moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Methods: An anchor-based, matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison was conducted for PGA treatment success (Physician's Global 
      Assessment of "clear" or "almost clear," [PGA 0/1] with at least a 2-point 
      improvement) using individual patient data from 3 randomized clinical studies of 
      Cal/BD foam and published data from 2 randomized, Phase 3 clinical studies of HP/TAZ 
      lotion. The number needed to treat and ICPR were also calculated.Results: After 
      reweighting of patients in the Cal/BD foam studies to match summary baseline 
      characteristics of the HP/TAZ lotion study patients and anchoring to vehicle effect, 
      4 weeks of Cal/BD foam produced a significantly greater rate of treatment success 
      than 8 weeks of HP/TAZ lotion treatment (51.4 vs. 30.7%; treatment difference = 
      20.7%, p < .001). The number needed to treat with Cal/BD foam was also less than 
      HP/TAZ lotion (1.9 vs. 3.3). Using US wholesale acquisition costs and equal weekly 
      consumption rates, the incremental cost per PGA 0/1 responder relative to vehicle 
      for Cal/BD foam was $3,988 and was 37% lower compared with HP/TAZ lotion 
      ($6,294).Conclusions: The indirect comparison analyses showed that Cal/BD foam was 
      associated with a greater rate of treatment success, lower ICPR, and quicker 
      treatment response than HP/TAZ lotion in adult patients with moderate-to-severe 
      plaque psoriasis.

TI  - Comparative safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus fingolimod for relapsing multiple 
      sclerosis.
PG  - 275-285
LID - 10.2217/cer-2019-0169 [doi]
AB  - Aim: Ozanimod and fingolimod are sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-modulating 
      therapies for relapsing multiple sclerosis. Patients & methods: Comparative 
      effectiveness was assessed by matching adjusted indirect comparisons of safety and 
      efficacy trial outcomes at first-dose cardiac monitoring, 1 year and 2 years. 
      Results: After adjustment, baseline characteristics were similar. Ozanimod was 
      associated with a lower risk of extended first-dose monitoring, conduction 
      abnormalities including atrioventricular block. One-year risks of any adverse event 
      (AE), mean lymphocyte count reductions and abnormal liver enzymes were lower with 
      ozanimod. Two-year risks of AEs leading to discontinuation, any AEs, herpetic 
      infections, bradycardia and abnormal liver enzymes were lower with ozanimod. 
      Analyses of efficacy outcomes were similar. Conclusion: Ozanimod appears to have a 
      favorable benefit-risk profile versus fingolimod.

TI  - Matching-adjusted comparison of oral corticosteroid reduction in asthma: Systematic 
      review of biologics.
PG  - 442-452
LID - 10.1111/cea.13561 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment for severe asthma is associated with 
      substantial disease burden. Thus, OCS dosage reduction is desirable. Relative 
      efficacy of biologics in reducing OCS treatment for severe, uncontrolled asthma is 
      not fully characterized. OBJECTIVE: We performed a matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison (MAIC) to assess the relative effects on OCS treatment reduction of three 
      biologic asthma treatments. METHODS: In MAIC of benralizumab vs. mepolizumab and vs. 
      dupilumab, patient-level data from the Phase III benralizumab OCS-sparing trial, 
      ZONDA, were weighted to match treatment effect-modifying patient characteristics in 
      comparator trials. RESULTS: After matching adjustment, mean difference between 
      benralizumab and mepolizumab for OCS reduction was 6.08% (95% CI -22.22-34.38; 
      P = .67) by week 24, and odds ratio of OCS elimination was 2.32 (95% CI 0.48-11.15; 
      P = .29). A trend in annual asthma exacerbation rate reduction favouring 
      benralizumab over mepolizumab was observed, although it was not statistically 
      significant (rate ratio [RR] = 0.56 [95% CI 0.28-1.13; P = .11]). Mean difference 
      between benralizumab and dupilumab for OCS reduction was -0.71% (95% CI 
      -20.56-19.15; P = .94), and odds ratio of OCS elimination was 2.26 (95% CI 
      0.52-9.84; P = .28). A non-significant trend in annual asthma exacerbation rate 
      reduction favouring benralizumab over dupilumab was observed (RR = 0.50 [95% CI 
      0.20-1.28; P = .15]). Effective sample size was 49% (72 vs. 148) and 25% (36 vs. 
      142) of original sample size for MAIC of benralizumab vs. mepolizumab and 
      benralizumab vs. dupilumab, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      Following patient baseline characteristics matching across clinical trials, 
      benralizumab demonstrated efficacy comparable to mepolizumab and dupilumab for OCS 
      dosage reduction, OCS elimination, and annual exacerbation rate reduction. 
      Comparatively low effective sample sizes indicated substantial differences for 
      patient populations between ZONDA and mepolizumab and dupilumab trials.

TI  - Cost per PASI-75 responder of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate cutaneous 
      foam versus nonbiologic systemic therapies for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in 
      seven European countries.
PG  - 701-708
LID - 10.1080/09546634.2019.1707754 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the short-term cost and effectiveness of 
      calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) cutaneous foam against nonbiologic 
      systemics in psoriasis patients for whom oral systemic or topical therapy is 
      considered appropriate in seven European countries. METHODS: Matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparisons of four-week PASI-75 responses of Cal/BD foam were performed 
      versus 12-week responses of methotrexate, acitretin, fumaric acid esters (FAE) and 
      16-week responses of apremilast. Analyses took a payer perspective and included 
      drug, physician visit and monitoring costs. RESULTS: In all countries, Cal/BD foam 
      generated the lowest cost per responder (CPR). Against methotrexate, apremilast and 
      acitretin, Cal/BD foam generated response for less than €190 in Italy, €195 in 
      Portugal, €216 in Greece, £218 in the United Kingdom, €250 in Belgium, €319 in 
      Spain, and €359 in the Netherlands. Relative to treatment with FAE, Cal/BD foam 
      resulted in response for less than €298, €430, €382 and £262 in Belgium, the 
      Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, respectively. For Cal/BD foam, apremilast 
      and FAE, total costs were driven by drug costs; for methotrexate and acitretin, by 
      monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Driven by its lower costs and high response rates, Cal/BD 
      foam is likely to be a cost-effective option over the short-term in the investigated 
      psoriasis population.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of Dabigatran Compared With Rivaroxaban for Prevention of Stroke 
      and Systemic Embolism in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation in China.
PG  - 144-156.e1
LID - S0149-2918(19)30573-9 [pii]

AB  - PURPOSE: In China, dabigatran and rivaroxaban are the only approved non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). The 
      goal of this article was to assess the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus 
      rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in Chinese patients 
      with AF from the perspective of the Chinese health care system. METHODS: A Markov 
      model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus 
      rivaroxaban. Clinical events were modeled for a lifetime horizon, based on clinical 
      efficacy data from indirect treatment comparisons. The weighted average of the most 
      recent prices of these 2 drugs was used as the drug acquisition cost. Other costs, 
      including follow-up costs and event costs, were collected by using a survey from a 
      panel of local experts. Utility inputs (health state utilities, clinical event 
      disutilities, and event history utility) were obtained from published literature. 
      Sensitivity analyses that included scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity 
      analysis were conducted to examine the robustness of the economic model. FINDINGS: 
      Over a lifetime, patients treated with dabigatran experienced fewer ischemic strokes 
      (2.14 dabigatran vs 2.61 rivaroxaban) and fewer intracranial hemorrhage (0.48 vs 
      0.94) per 100 patient-years. In the base case analysis, dabigatran had an 
      incremental cost of ¥28,128 but with higher life years (10.38 vs 10.14) and 
      quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (7.95 vs 7.70). The resulting incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥112,910 per QALY gained and net monetary benefit of 
      ¥12,214 versus rivaroxaban showed that dabigatran was a cost-effective alternative 
      to rivaroxaban. Extensive sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were 
      robust over a wide range of inputs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated 
      that dabigatran was cost-effective in 84.2% of the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations 
      compared with rivaroxaban. IMPLICATIONS: Dabigatran reduced the occurrence of 
      clinical events and increased QALYs compared with rivaroxaban. The use of dabigatran 
      for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism is a cost-effective option 
      compared with rivaroxaban among patients with AF in China.

TI  - After 20 Years of Using Economic Evaluation, Should NICE be Considered a Methods 
      Innovator?
PG  - 247-257
LID - 10.1007/s40273-019-00882-6 [doi]
AB  - The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is only one of several 
      organisations internationally that uses economic evaluation as part of decision 
      making regarding funding and pricing of new medical technologies. However, it can be 
      argued that NICE has developed a more prominent international profile than most in 
      their use of economics. After 20 years of operation, it is timely to assess the 
      extent of NICE's achievements, including the economic evaluation methods it has used 
      and its willingness to adapt these as new evaluative approaches emerge and when NICE 
      faces particular policy challenges. This paper considers some of the important 
      policy and contextual developments in the UK over the last 20 years and how these 
      may have shaped NICE's approach to economic evaluation. It then assesses key areas 
      of NICE methods, including perspective, defining benefits, modelling and 
      uncertainty. The paper concludes that NICE has provided important support for the 
      development of new methods, in particular through its role in identifying priorities 
      for methods research funding and its sponsorship of the NICE Decision Support Unit. 
      However, potentially important developments in methods in a number of important 
      areas have yet to be formally included in NICE's methods guidance and this should be 
      addressed in the Institute's 2019/2020 methods review.

TI  - Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies host dependency factors for influenza A virus 
      infection.
PG  - 164
LID - 10.1038/s41467-019-13965-x [doi]
LID - 164
AB  - Host dependency factors that are required for influenza A virus infection may serve 
      as therapeutic targets as the virus is less likely to bypass them under 
      drug-mediated selection pressure. Previous attempts to identify host factors have 
      produced largely divergent results, with few overlapping hits across different 
      studies. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen and devise a new 
      approach, meta-analysis by information content (MAIC) to systematically combine our 
      results with prior evidence for influenza host factors. MAIC out-performs other 
      meta-analysis methods when using our CRISPR screen as validation data. We validate 
      the host factors, WDR7, CCDC115 and TMEM199, demonstrating that these genes are 
      essential for viral entry and regulation of V-type ATPase assembly. We also find 
      that CMTR1, a human mRNA cap methyltransferase, is required for efficient viral cap 
      snatching and regulation of a cell autonomous immune response, and provides 
      synergistic protection with the influenza endonuclease inhibitor Xofluza.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease for which some people have a 
      genetic predisposition. The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either 
      the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although 
      there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow 
      sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in 
      psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains 
      unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head, 
      which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. This is the baseline 
      update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2017, in preparation for this 
      Cochrane Review becoming a living systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To compare the 
      efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biologics 
      for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and to provide a ranking of these 
      treatments according to their efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: We updated our 
      research using the following databases to January 2019: the Cochrane Skin 
      Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
      MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and the conference proceedings of a number of dermatology 
      meetings. We also searched five trials registers and the US Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports (until June 2019). 
      We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further 
      references to relevant RCTs. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
      of systemic treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe 
      plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed 
      with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to 
      placebo or another active agent. The primary outcomes of this review were: the 
      proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at 
      least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 at induction phase (from 8 to 24 
      weeks after the randomisation), and the proportion of participants with serious 
      adverse effects (SAEs) at induction phase. We did not evaluate differences in 
      specific adverse effects. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Several groups of two review 
      authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' 
      assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network 
      meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to 
      their effectiveness (as measured by the PASI 90 score) and acceptability (the 
      inverse of serious adverse effects). We assessed the certainty of the body of 
      evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes, according to GRADE, as either 
      very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear 
      or missing. MAIN RESULTS: We included 140 studies (31 new studies for the update) in 
      our review (51,749 randomised participants, 68% men, mainly recruited from 
      hospitals). The overall average age was 45 years; the overall mean PASI score at 
      baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo-controlled 
      (59%), 30% were head-to-head studies, and 11% were multi-armed studies with both an 
      active comparator and a placebo. We have assessed a total of 19 treatments. In all, 
      117 trials were multicentric (two to 231 centres). All but two of the outcomes 
      included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment from 8 to 24 
      weeks after randomisation). We assessed many studies (57/140) as being at high risk 
      of bias; 42 were at an unclear risk, and 41 at low risk. Most studies (107/140) 
      declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 22 studies did not report the 
      source of funding. Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the 
      interventions (conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biological 
      treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in terms of reaching PASI 
      90. At class level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, 
      anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than 
      the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents. At drug level, in terms of 
      reaching PASI 90, infliximab, all of the anti-IL17 drugs (ixekizumab, secukinumab, 
      bimekizumab and brodalumab) and the anti-IL23 drugs (risankizumab and guselkumab, 
      but not tildrakizumab) were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than 
      ustekinumab and 3 anti-TNF alpha agents: adalimumab, certolizumab and etanercept. 
      Adalimumab and ustekinumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 
      than certolizumab and etanercept. There was no significant difference between 
      tofacitinib or apremilast and between two conventional drugs: ciclosporin and 
      methotrexate. Network meta-analysis also showed that infliximab, ixekizumab, 
      risankizumab, bimekizumab, guselkumab, secukinumab and brodalumab outperformed other 
      drugs when compared to placebo in reaching PASI 90. The clinical effectiveness for 
      these seven drugs was similar: infliximab (versus placebo): risk ratio (RR) 29.52, 
      95% confidence interval (CI) 19.94 to 43.70, Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking 
      (SUCRA) = 88.5; moderate-certainty evidence; ixekizumab (versus placebo): RR 28.12, 
      95% CI 23.17 to 34.12, SUCRA = 88.3, moderate-certainty evidence; risankizumab 
      (versus placebo): RR 27.67, 95% CI 22.86 to 33.49, SUCRA = 87.5, high-certainty 
      evidence; bimekizumab (versus placebo): RR 58.64, 95% CI 3.72 to 923.86, SUCRA = 
      83.5, low-certainty evidence; guselkumab (versus placebo): RR 25.84, 95% CI 20.90 to 
      31.95; SUCRA = 81; moderate-certainty evidence; secukinumab (versus placebo): RR 
      23.97, 95% CI 20.03 to 28.70, SUCRA = 75.4; high-certainty evidence; and brodalumab 
      (versus placebo): RR 21.96, 95% CI 18.17 to 26.53, SUCRA = 68.7; moderate-certainty 
      evidence. Conservative interpretation is warranted for the results for bimekizumab 
      (as well as tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid 
      esters, and methotrexate), as these drugs, in the NMA, have been evaluated in few 
      trials. We found no significant difference between any of the interventions and the 
      placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAE analyses were based on a very 
      low number of events with low to very low certainty for just under half of the 
      treatment estimates in total, and moderate for the others. Thus, the results have to 
      be viewed with caution and we cannot be sure of the ranking. For other efficacy 
      outcomes (PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1) the results were very 
      similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on quality of life was often poorly 
      reported and was absent for several of the interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, ixekizumab, 
      risankizumab, bimekizumab, guselkumab, secukinumab and brodalumab were the best 
      choices for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis on the 
      basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence (low-certainty evidence for 
      bimekizumab). This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were 
      measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficient for 
      evaluation of longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low 
      numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 45 
      years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical 
      of patients seen in daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that 
      short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly-reported safety data and thus 
      do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. 
      Indeed, we found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo 
      in terms of SAEs, but the evidence for all the interventions was of very low to 
      moderate quality. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the 
      treatments included in this review, it will also be necessary to evaluate 
      non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies. 
      In terms of future research, randomised trials comparing directly active agents are 
      necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, 
      including head-to-head trials amongst and between conventional systemic and small 
      molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23 
      versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also 
      undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve 
      participants, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). 
      Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and 
      researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the 
      interventions and the comparative safety of different agents. Editorial note: This 
      is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to 
      review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant 
      new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of 
      Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.

AB  - Aim: To compare the overall survival of patients with metastatic urothelial 
      carcinoma (mUC) who failed platinum-based chemotherapy and received durvalumab or 
      chemotherapy. Patients & methods: In an indirect comparison of patients with mUC who 
      failed platinum-based chemotherapy, those who received durvalumab in a single-arm 
      study were matched to patients from the Flatiron oncology electronic medical record 
      database who received chemotherapy (n = 158 for each cohort). Matching was based on 
      propensity scores. Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression models were utilized. 
      Results: Median overall survival was 11.2 months (95% CI: 7.2-16.9) for durvalumab 
      versus 8.2 months (95% CI: 6.7-9.8) for chemotherapy (hazard ratio: 0.63; 95% CI: 
      0.48-0.84). Conclusion: As a second-line therapy for mUC, durvalumab was associated 
      with longer overall survival than chemotherapy.

PG  - 103-114
LID - 10.2217/cer-2019-0145 [doi]
AB  - Aim: To determine the effectiveness of nivolumab compared with routine clinical 
      practice (RCP) for patients with gastric or gastroesophageal cancer refractory to, 
      or intolerant of, two or more previous regimens, using real-world electronic patient 
      records from a US population, a single-arm trial (CheckMate 032) and a randomized 
      controlled trial in an Asian setting (ATTRACTION-2). Materials & methods: A 
      simulated treatment comparison was conducted to predict overall survival for 
      patients treated with nivolumab compared with RCP in the USA. Results: Results of 
      the indirect simulated treatment comparison suggest that nivolumab is associated 
      with a 50% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality relative to RCP (Hazard 
      ratio: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.68). Conclusion: The survival benefit of nivolumab may 
      extend more generally to the USA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To conduct an indirect treatment comparison of patients with high-volume 
      mHSPC and a cost analysis between Abi-ADT and Doc-ADT therapies in China. METHODS: 
      The Bucher technique for indirect treatment comparison was used. A cost analysis was 
      conducted from both healthcare and patient perspectives. RESULTS: The indirect 
      treatment comparison demonstrated no significant difference in PFS for Abi-ADT 
      versus Doc-ADT (HR: 0.84, 95% CI 0.66-1.07). Doc-ADT therapy costs less than 
      Abi-ADT, with potential savings of up to RMB 887,057 per patient from the healthcare 
      perspective and RMB 226,210 per patient from the patient perspective. CONCLUSIONS: 
      No significant differences in PFS between Doc-ADT and Abi-ADT therapy for patients 
      with high-volume mHSPC. Doc-ADT therapy is a cost-saving alternative to Abi-ADT in 
      China.

TI  - Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation Using Ablation Index-Guided Contact Force Ablation: 
      A Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison to Cryoballoon Ablation.
PG  - 785-799
LID - 10.1007/s12325-019-01173-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ablation Index, also known as VISITAG SURPOINT™, is a novel 
      lesion-quality marker that improves outcomes in radiofrequency (RF) catheter 
      ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). There is no direct evidence on the comparative 
      effectiveness of RF ablation with Ablation Index and cryoballoon (CB). The objective 
      of the present study was to conduct a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) 
      using individual patient-level data (IPD) to compare the effectiveness of RF 
      ablation with Ablation Index to that of CB on recurrence of atrial arrhythmias 
      12 months after catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF). METHODS: 
      Individual patient-level data for RF ablation with Ablation Index were obtained from 
      two studies: Solimene et al. [J Interv Card Electrophysiol 54(1):9-15, 2019] and 
      Hussein et al. [J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 28(9):1037-1047, 2017]. Comparable CB 
      studies identified from a systematic literature review were pooled. Prognostic 
      variables for adjustment were ranked a priori by several practicing 
      electrophysiologists. In the absence of a common treatment arm between the Ablation 
      Index and CB studies, an unanchored MAIC was conducted. Primary analysis compared 
      the Solimene et al. study to pooled CB studies. A secondary analysis compared pooled 
      RF ablation with Ablation Index studies to pooled CB studies. Several scenario and 
      sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Primary analyses showed statistically 
      significant reductions in the rate of arrhythmia recurrence with RF ablation with 
      Ablation Index compared to CB in unmatched, unadjusted (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.95) 
      and matched (0.42, 0.21-0.86) analyses. Greater reductions in the rate of arrhythmia 
      recurrence that favored RF ablation with Ablation Index were observed after matching 
      and adjusting for age (0.41, 0.20-0.85), age and left ventricular ejection fraction 
      (0.37, 0.16-0.88), and age, sex, and left ventricular ejection fraction (0.30, 
      0.13-0.71). Secondary and sensitivity analyses showed similar reductions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation with Ablation Index was associated with 
      reductions in recurrence of atrial arrhythmias at 12 months compared to CB in 
      unmatched and unadjusted, matched, and matched and adjusted comparisons.

TI  - Efficacy of antimalarial drugs for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in 
      Asian region: A network meta-analysis.
PG  - e0225882
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0225882 [doi]
LID - e0225882
AB  - BACKGROUND: The WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for 
      the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Hence, monitoring the efficacy of 
      antimalarial drugs is a key component of malaria control and elimination. The 
      published randomized trials that assessed comparisons of ACTs for treating 
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria reported conflicting results in treatment efficacy. 
      A network meta-analysis is an extension of pairwise meta-analysis that can 
      synthesize evidence simultaneously from both direct and indirect treatment 
      comparisons. The objective was to synthesize evidence on the comparative efficacy of 
      antimalarial drugs for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Asian 
      region. METHODS: Relevant randomized trials that assessed efficacy of antimalarial 
      drugs for patients having uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Asian region were 
      searched in health-related databases. We evaluated the methodological quality of the 
      included studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Main outcome was treatment 
      success at day 28 as determined by the absence of parasiteamia. We performed network 
      meta-analysis of the interventions in the trials, and assessed the overall quality 
      of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Seventeen randomized trials (n = 
      5043) were included in this network meta-analysis study. A network geometry was 
      formed with 14 antimalarial treatment options such as artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 
      artemisinin-piperaquine, artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ), 
      artesunate-chloroquine, artesunate-mefloquine home treatment, artesunate-mefloquine 
      2-day course, artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, chloroquine, 
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine home treatment, 
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 4-day course, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and 
      added artesunate, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. A maximum number of trials included was 
      DHP compared to ASMQ (n = 5). In general, DHP had better efficacy than AL at day 28 
      (DHP vs AL: OR 2.5, 95%CI:1.08-5.8). There is low certainty evidence due to limited 
      number of studies and small trials. DISCUSSION/ CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest 
      the superiority of DHP (3-day course) to AL and other comparator ACTs are with the 
      overall low/very low quality of evidence judgements. Moreover, one drug regimen is 
      better than another is only if current drug-resistance patterns are at play. For 
      example, the AL might be better than DHP in areas where both artemisinin and 
      piperaquine resistance patterns are prevalent. For substantiation, well-designed 
      larger trials from endemic countries are needed. In the light of benefit versus harm 
      concept, future analysis with safety information is recommended.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in elderly 
      patients with atrial fibrillation: systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 studies 
      and 440 281 patients.
PG  - f20-f29
LID - 10.1093/ehjcvp/pvz073 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
      of non-vitamin K oral antagonists (NOACs) vs. vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in 
      elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and indirectly compare NOACs in this 
      population. METHODS AND RESULTS: MEDLINE, Cochrane, ISI Web of Sciences, and SCOPUS 
      were searched for randomized or adjusted observational studies comparing NOACs vs. 
      VKAs for stroke prevention in AF patients ≥75 years. The primary efficacy and safety 
      outcomes of this meta-analysis were the composite of stroke and systemic embolism 
      (SSE) and major bleedings, respectively. Other secondary outcomes were also 
      analysed. The analysis included 22 studies enrolling 440 281 AF patients ≥ 75 years. 
      The risk of SSE was significantly lower with NOACs vs. VKAs [hazard ratio (HR) 0.79; 
      95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.89], whereas no differences were found for major 
      bleedings (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.85-1.05). NOACs reduced the risk of intracranial 
      bleeding (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.38-0.58), haemorrhagic stroke (HR 0.61; 95% CI 
      0.48-0.79) and fatal bleeding (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.30-0.72) but increased 
      gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.30-1.65), compared to VKAs. The 
      adjusted indirect comparison showed no significant differences in term of SSE 
      between NOAC agents. Conversely, the risk of major bleeding was higher for 
      rivaroxaban vs. apixaban (HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.39-2.08) and edoxaban (HR 1.37; 95% CI 
      1.14-1.67), and for dabigatran vs. apixaban (HR 1.47; 95% CI 1.18-1.85). CONCLUSION: 
      In elderly patients with AF, NOACs are associated to a lower risk of SSE, 
      intracranial bleeding, haemorrhagic stroke and fatal bleeding than VKAs, but 
      increase GI bleedings. In this analysis, the safety profile of individual NOAC 
      agents was significantly different.

TI  - Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Health-Related Quality of Life and Adverse 
      Events of Apalutamide Versus Enzalutamide in Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant 
      Prostate Cancer.
PG  - 512-526

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The present study aimed to indirectly compare apalutamide and 
      enzalutamide with respect to tolerability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
      among men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). 
      METHODS: Patient-level data from the SPARTAN study [apalutamide + androgen 
      deprivation therapy (ADT) versus placebo + ADT] and aggregate published data from 
      the PROSPER study (enzalutamide + ADT versus placebo + ADT) were used. Anchored 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted by weighting patients' 
      baseline characteristics from SPARTAN to match aggregated baseline characteristics 
      in PROSPER. Odds ratios (ORs) of reported adverse events (AEs) and 
      baseline-to-follow-up least squares mean differences in HRQoL [measured with 
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) score] with 95% credible 
      intervals were re-estimated for SPARTAN arms using weighted population and 
      indirectly compared with those in PROSPER through a Bayesian framework. Events of 
      special interest included fatigue, hot flush, nausea, diarrhea, hypertension, falls, 
      dizziness, decreased appetite, arthralgia, asthenia and headache. In addition, any 
      AEs and serious AEs were explored. RESULTS: Of 1207 SPARTAN patients, 1171 were 
      matched to 1401 PROSPER patients. Relative to enzalutamide, apalutamide demonstrated 
      better tolerability as evidenced by the highest probability of reduced occurrence of 
      fatigue [p(OR < 1) = 99.5%], hypertension [p(OR < 1) = 99.2%], decreased appetite 
      [p(OR < 1) = 98.3%], fall [p(OR < 1) = 90.3%], headaches [p(OR < 1) = 86.7%], and 
      nausea [p(OR < 1) = 80.0%]. The probabilities of reduced occurrence of any AEs and 
      SAEs with apalutamide versus enzalutamide were 66.9% and 90.9%, respectively. 
      Relative to enzalutamide, apalutamide treatment was associated with a higher 
      probability of a better HRQoL based on the FACT-P total score [p(diff > 0) = 73.1%]. 
      The probability of a better HRQoL with apalutamide versus enzalutamide was highest 
      for the physical [p(diff > 0) = 97.3%] and functional [p(diff > 0) = 86.7%] 
      wellbeing subscales, and the pain-related subscale [p(diff > 0) = 90.1%]. 
      CONCLUSION: Anchored MAIC suggests that treatment of men with nmCRPC with 
      apalutamide is associated with a higher probability of better tolerability due to 
      fewer AEs and better HRQoL than enzalutamide.

TI  - Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of the Efficacy of Apalutamide and 
      Enzalutamide with ADT in the Treatment of Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant 
      Prostate Cancer.
PG  - 501-511
LID - 10.1007/s12325-019-01156-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Apalutamide and enzalutamide are next-generation androgen receptor 
      inhibitors that demonstrated efficacy in placebo-controlled studies (SPARTAN for 
      apalutamide; PROSPER for enzalutamide) when used in combination with androgen 
      deprivation therapy (ADT) for treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer (nmCRPC). In the absence of comparative studies between these 
      agents, the present study sought to indirectly compare metastasis-free survival 
      (MFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with nmCRPC who received these 
      therapies. METHODS: Individual patient-level data from SPARTAN (apalutamide plus 
      ADT) and published data from PROSPER (enzalutamide plus ADT) were utilized. An 
      anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted by weighting the 
      patients from the SPARTAN study to match baseline characteristics reported for 
      PROSPER. Hazard ratios (HRs) for MFS and OS were re-estimated for SPARTAN using 
      weighted Cox proportional hazards models and indirectly compared with those of 
      PROSPER using a Bayesian network meta-analysis. RESULTS: From the SPARTAN population 
      (N = 1207), a total of 1171 patients were matched to the PROSPER population 
      (N = 1401). The recalculated HRs (95% confidence interval) for apalutamide versus 
      ADT based on the reweighted SPARTAN data to mimic the PROSPER patient population 
      were 0.26 (0.21; 0.33) for MFS and 0.62 (0.41; 0.94) for OS. MAIC-based HRs (95% 
      credible interval) for apalutamide versus enzalutamide were 0.91 (0.68; 1.22) for 
      MFS and 0.77 (0.46; 1.30) for OS. The Bayesian probabilities of apalutamide being 
      more effective than enzalutamide were 73.6% for MFS and 83.5% for OS. CONCLUSIONS: 
      MAIC results suggest that nmCRPC patients treated with apalutamide have a higher 
      probability of a more favorable MFS and OS compared with those treated with 
      enzalutamide.

      a case study in psoriatic arthritis.
PG  - 1265-1298
LID - 10.2217/cer-2019-0064 [doi]
AB  - Aim: Indirect treatment comparisons are used when no direct comparison is available. 
      Comparison networks should satisfy the transitivity assumption, that is, equal 
      likelihood of treatment assignment for a given patient based on comparability of 
      studies. Materials & methods: Seven criteria were evaluated across 18 randomized 
      controlled trials in psoriatic arthritis: inclusion/exclusion criteria, clinical 
      trial design and follow-up, patient-level baseline characteristics, disease 
      severity, prior therapies, concomitant and extended-trial treatment and placebo 
      response differences. Results: Across studies, placebo was a common comparator, and 
      key efficacy end points were reported. Collectively, several potential sources of 
      insufficient transitivity were identified, most often related to trial design and 
      population differences. Conclusion: Potential challenges in satisfying transitivity 
      occur frequently and should be evaluated thoroughly.

AB  - Improved understanding of the contribution of immune-inflammatory mechanisms in 
      allergic diseases and asthma has encouraged development of biologicals and small 
      molecules specifically targeting the innate and adaptive immune response. There are 
      several critical points impacting the efficacy of this stratified approach, from the 
      complexity of disease endotypes to the effectiveness in real-world settings. We 
      discuss here how these barriers can be overcome to facilitate the development of 
      implementation science for allergic diseases and asthma.

TI  - Matching-adjusted Indirect Comparisons of the Efficacy and Safety of Acalabrutinib 
      Versus Other Targeted Therapies in Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma.
PG  - 2357-2379.e1
LID - S0149-2918(19)30490-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2019.09.012 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
      that can be either aggressive or indolent. Although MCL usually responds well to 
      initial treatment with chemotherapy-based regimens, the disease often relapses or 
      becomes refractory within a few years. Acalabrutinib is a highly selective, potent, 
      covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor with minimal off-target activity. WIthout 
      head-to-head clinical trial data, estimation of the comparative efficacy and safety 
      of new therapeutic entities provides valuable information for patients, clinicians, 
      and health care payers. The objective of this analysis was to compare the efficacy 
      and safety of acalabrutinib versus other targeted therapies employed for the 
      treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL by using matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparisons. METHODS: Individual data from 124 patients treated with acalabrutinib 
      in the Phase II ACE-LY-004 trial were adjusted to match average baseline 
      characteristics of populations from studies using alternative targeted treatment 
      regimens for relapsed/refractory MCL (for monotherapy: ibrutinib, bortezomib, 
      lenalidomide, and temsirolimus; for combination therapies: ibrutinib + rituximab, 
      bendamustine + rituximab, and lenalidomide + rituximab). Patient populations were 
      matched on age, sex, race, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, 
      Simplified MCL International Prognostic Index score, tumor bulk, lactate 
      dehydrogenase concentration, extranodal disease, bone marrow involvement, and number 
      of previous treatment regimens. Outcomes assessed included overall response rate 
      (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival 
      (PFS), and adverse events. FINDINGS: After matching, acalabrutinib was associated 
      with significant increases in ORR and CR rate (estimated treatment difference [95% 
      CI]) versus ibrutinib (ORR, 9.3% [0.3-18.3]; CR, 14.9% [5.4-24.3]), bortezomib (ORR, 
      50.6% [40.2-61.0]; CR, 18.8% [9.1-28.5]), lenalidomide (ORR, 38.1% [27.1-49.1]; CR, 
      43.5% [34.8-52.3]), and temsirolimus (ORR, 40.7% [31.0-50.4]; CR, 27.1% 
      [19.2-35.0]). PFS (hazard ratio [95% CI]) with acalabrutinib was significantly 
      increased versus bortezomib (0.36 [0.26-0.51]), lenalidomide (0.65 [0.48-0.89]), 
      lenalidomide + rituximab (0.57 [0.35-0.93]), and temsirolimus (0.33 [0.24-0.45]). 
      Acalabrutinib was associated with significantly increased OS (hazard ratio) versus 
      bortezomib (0.36 [0.22-0.61]) and temsirolimus (0.32 [0.23-0.44]). The overall 
      safety profile of acalabrutinib was similar or better compared with the 
      monotherapies; however, infection risk increased versus bendamustine + rituximab, 
      and anemia increased risk versus lenalidomide + rituximab and ibrutinib + rituximab. 
      IMPLICATIONS: This comparison of targeted therapies used in the treatment of 
      relapsed/refractory MCL showed that acalabrutinib has the potential to provide 
      increased response rates, with trends for increased PFS and OS, and an improved 
      safety profile.

TI  - The effects of different schedules of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone for 
      patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible: a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 680-690

AB  - For patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who are transplant 
      ineligible, bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP) demonstrated superior efficacy 
      based on the VISTA trial. In subsequent trials, twice-weekly bortezomib was limited 
      to the first cycle or completely replaced with once-weekly bortezomib to reduce 
      toxicity. Following a systematic literature review, the efficacy and safety of 
      modified VMP schedules (pooled data from the once-weekly bortezomib VMP arm of the 
      GIMEMA trial and the VMP arm of the ALCYONE trial) were compared to the VISTA 
      schedule using naïve and unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). 
      Median progression-free survival was similar between VISTA and modified VMP 
      (20.7 months [95% CI, 18.4-24.3] vs 19.6 months [95% CI, 18.8-21.0]). Peripheral 
      neuropathy was significantly reduced with modified VMP versus VISTA VMP (all grades: 
      naïve, 32.1% vs 46.8% and MAIC, 32.1% vs 46.7%; both p < .0001). These findings 
      support a modified VMP dosing schedule for patients with NDMM who are transplant 
      ineligible.

AB  - D-VMP is a novel treatment for transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple 
      myeloma (TIE NDMM). D-VMP significantly prolonged PFS versus VMP in the ALCYONE 
      trial. The FIRST trial investigated Rd given in 28-day cycles until disease 
      progression, Rd for 18 cycles, and MPT for 12 cycles for TIE NDMM. As no randomized 
      controlled trials comparing D-VMP to standard-of-care regimens such as those in 
      FIRST are available, an MAIC was performed to assess relative OS and PFS for D-VMP 
      from ALYCONE and Rd continuous, Rd 18, and MPT from FIRST. Individual patient data 
      for D-VMP in ALCYONE were weighted to match aggregated baseline patient 
      characteristics for each arm of FIRST. D-VMP significantly improved OS versus MPT 
      and Rd 18, with a trend favoring D-VMP versus Rd continuous. D-VMP performed 
      significantly better than all FIRST comparators for PFS. This MAIC demonstrates OS 
      and PFS benefits for D-VMP versus Rd continuous, Rd 18, and MPT.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Apixaban Versus Edoxaban in Patients with Atrial 
      Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention.
PG  - 485-497
LID - 10.1007/s41669-019-00186-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the cost effectiveness of apixaban versus 
      edoxaban in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with 
      atrial fibrillation (AF) in Spain. METHODS: We customized a Markov model with ten 
      health states to estimate the lifetime economic and clinical outcomes in 6-week 
      cycles. The efficacy (clinical event rates per 100 patient-years) and safety data 
      were derived from a pairwise indirect treatment comparison. The analysis was 
      conducted from both the national health service (NHS) and societal perspectives, and 
      included pharmaceutical costs (retail price plus value-added tax (VAT) and 
      applicable national deductions) according to daily dosages (apixaban 10 mg (5 mg 
      twice daily (bid)) and edoxaban 60 or 30 mg) and complications and 
      disease-management costs, obtained from national databases. Utilities for 
      quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) calculations reflected EuroQoL 5-Dimension scores 
      in patients with AF. An annual discount rate of 3% was applied for costs (€, year 
      2019 values) and outcomes. RESULTS: In a 1000-patient cohort, apixaban 5 mg bid 
      versus edoxaban 60 mg could avoid five strokes, six major bleedings and 29 
      clinically relevant non-major bleedings (CRNMBs). Compared with edoxaban 30 mg, 
      apixaban could avoid 21 strokes and two SEs. An increase in bleedings was observed 
      with apixaban (seven haemorrhagic strokes, 48 major bleedings and 17 CRNMBs). 
      Apixaban yielded 0.04 additional QALYs compared with edoxaban 60 mg or 30 mg. 
      Incremental costs/QALY were €9639.33 and €354.22 for apixaban versus edoxaban 60 mg 
      and edoxaban 30 mg, respectively, from the NHS perspective and €7756.62 for apixaban 
      versus edoxaban 60 mg from the societal perspective. Apixaban was dominant versus 
      edoxaban 30 mg from the societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the 
      robustness of the model. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that apixaban 5 mg bid is 
      a cost-effective alternative to edoxaban for stroke prevention in the AF population 
      in Spain.

TI  - Budget Impact of Dabrafenib and Trametinib in Combination as Adjuvant Treatment of 
      BRAF V600E/K Mutation-Positive Melanoma from a U.S. Commercial Payer Perspective.
PG  - 1227-1237
LID - 10.18553/jmcp.2019.25.11.1227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Before the approval of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination, there 
      were no approved therapies in the adjuvant setting that target the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK 
      pathway. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the budget impact of dabrafenib and trametinib in 
      combination for adjuvant treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive 
      resected Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC melanoma from a U.S. commercial payer perspective 
      using data from the COMBI-AD trial, as well as other sources. METHODS: The budget 
      impact of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination for patients with BRAF V600E/K 
      mutation-positive, resected Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC melanoma was evaluated from 
      the perspective of a hypothetical population of 1 million members with demographic 
      characteristics consistent with those of a commercially insured U.S. insurance plan 
      (i.e., adults aged less than 65 years) using an economic model developed in 
      Microsoft Excel. The model compared melanoma-related health care costs over a 3-year 
      projection period under 2 scenarios: (1) a reference scenario in which dabrafenib 
      and trametinib are assumed to be unavailable for adjuvant therapy and (2) a new 
      scenario in which the combination is assumed to be available. Treatments potentially 
      displaced by dabrafenib and trametinib were assumed to include observation, 
      high-dose interferon alpha-2b, ipilimumab, and nivolumab. Costs considered in the 
      model include those of adjuvant therapies and treatment of locoregional and distant 
      recurrences. The numbers of patients eligible for treatment with dabrafenib and 
      trametinib were based on data from cancer registries, published sources, and 
      assumptions. Treatment mixes under the reference and new scenarios were based on 
      market research data, clinical expert opinion, and assumptions. Probabilities of 
      recurrence and death were based on data from the COMBI-AD trial and an indirect 
      treatment comparison. Medication costs were based on wholesale acquisition cost 
      prices. Costs of distant recurrence were from a health insurance claims study. 
      RESULTS: In a hypothetical population of 1 million commercially insured members, 48 
      patients were estimated to become eligible for treatment with dabrafenib and 
      trametinib in combination over the 3-year projection period; in the new scenario, 10 
      patients were projected to receive such treatment. Cumulative costs of 
      melanoma-related care were estimated to be $6.3 million in the reference scenario 
      and $6.9 million in the new scenario. The budget impact of dabrafenib and trametinib 
      in combination was an increase of $549 thousand overall and 1.5 cents per member per 
      month. CONCLUSIONS: For a hypothetical U.S. commercial health plan of 1 million 
      members, the budget impact of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination as adjuvant 
      treatment for melanoma is likely to be relatively modest and within the range of 
      published estimates for oncology therapies. These results may assist payers in 
      making coverage decisions regarding the use of adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib in 
      melanoma. DISCLOSURES: Funding for this research was provided to Policy Analysis

TI  - Adjusted treatment COMPArisons between guSelkumab and uStekinumab for treatment of 
      moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: the COMPASS analysis.
PG  - 276-284
LID - 10.1111/bjd.18634 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guselkumab is an interleukin-23 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of 
      moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Guselkumab has demonstrated 
      additional benefit in patients with early inadequate response to ustekinumab. 
      Long-term efficacy comparisons of guselkumab and ustekinumab are currently lacking 
      among ustekinumab-naive patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative efficacy of 
      guselkumab and ustekinumab for maintenance therapy of moderate-to-severe plaque 
      psoriasis, using individual patient data (IPD) from randomized controlled trials. 
      METHODS: IPD for guselkumab from the VOYAGE 1 and 2 trials were pooled and compared 
      with IPD for ustekinumab from the NAVIGATE trial. Multivariable logistic regression 
      analyses compared guselkumab 100 mg and ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg for the 
      achievement and maintenance of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90, 75 and 
      100 responses up to 40 weeks. The regression models accounted for a range of 
      clinically relevant covariates (e.g. age, sex, psoriasis duration). Relative 
      efficacy was expressed using odds ratios (ORs) and predicted probability of 
      treatment response associated with each intervention. RESULTS: Patients receiving 
      guselkumab had significantly higher probabilities of achieving a PASI 90 response 
      than patients receiving ustekinumab, at both week 16 [70·4% vs. 46·0%, OR 2·79, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 2·22-3·45] and week 40 (74·2% vs. 54·5%, OR 2·40, 95% CI 
      1·89-3·13]. Guselkumab was also associated with a significantly increased likelihood 
      of achieving both PASI 75 and PASI 100 responses at weeks 16 and 40, compared with 
      ustekinumab. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted analyses leveraging IPD demonstrate that 
      guselkumab has a significantly higher probability of achieving and maintaining PASI 
      treatment responses through week 40 than ustekinumab does.

TI  - Using Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparisons and Network Meta-analyses to Compare 
      Efficacy of Brexanolone Injection with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors for 
      Treating Postpartum Depression.
PG  - 1039-1052
LID - 10.1007/s40263-019-00672-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brexanolone injection, the first therapy approved by the US FDA for the 
      treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in adults, has been shown to produce a 
      significantly greater decrease in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) 
      total score than placebo in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women with PPD. 
      OBJECTIVES: Given the rapid effect of brexanolone injection (within 60 h) sustained 
      throughout the length of the trials (30 days), we sought to compare its efficacy 
      data against selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the class of 
      antidepressants most commonly prescribed for PPD, using HAM-D and Edinburgh 
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) outcomes from currently available RCTs. METHODS: 
      We extracted data from 26 studies identified in a systematic literature review of 
      pharmacological and pharmacological/nonpharmacological combination therapies in PPD. 
      Six studies were suitable to form evidence networks through which to perform 
      indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) of HAM-D and EPDS outcomes between brexanolone 
      and SSRIs. Having assessed the comparability and suitability of the available 
      evidence for analysis, we discovered significant heterogeneity in the study designs, 
      most notably in the placebo arms of the trials. We therefore conducted 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) between brexanolone and the placebo 
      arms of comparator studies, subsequently using the MAIC results of brexanolone 
      versus placebo, and results for SSRIs versus placebo, to form ITCs of brexanolone 
      versus SSRIs at three separate time points-day 3, week 4 and last observation. ITCs 
      were calculated as the differences in change from baseline (CFB) in HAM-D and, 
      separately, CFB in EPDS, between treatments, and reported with 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs). RESULTS: For all time points, MAICs showed larger differences in 
      CFB for brexanolone compared with SSRIs. Differences (95% CIs) between brexanolone 
      and SSRIs were 12.79 (8.04-17.53) [day 3], 5.87 (- 1.62 to 13.37) [week 4] and 0.97 
      (- 6.35 to 8.30) [last observation] for the HAM-D. For the EPDS, the differences in 
      CFB were 7.98 (5.32-10.64) [day 3], 6.35 (3.13-9.57) [week 4] and 4.05 (0.79-7.31) 
      [last observation]. Other analytical approaches are also presented to demonstrate 
      the similarity of results, using a network meta-analysis approach, and the 
      importance of using the MAIC method to control for the important heterogeneity 
      between placebo arms. CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledging the limitations of ITCs and this 
      evidence base, when compared with SSRIs, these analyses suggest that brexanolone 
      demonstrated larger differences in CFB for both patient- and clinician-reported PPD 
      outcomes and at all investigated time points after adjusting for differences between 
      placebos in the included studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several reviews have noted shortcomings regarding the quality and 
      reporting of network meta-analyses (NMAs). We suspect that this issue may be 
      partially attributable to limitations in current NMA software which do not readily 
      produce all of the output needed to satisfy current guidelines. RESULTS: To better 
      facilitate the conduct and reporting of NMAs, we have created an R package called 
      "BUGSnet" (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling to conduct a Network 
      meta-analysis). This R package relies upon Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) to 
      conduct Bayesian NMA using a generalized linear model. BUGSnet contains a suite of 
      functions that can be used to describe the evidence network, estimate a model and 
      assess the model fit and convergence, assess the presence of heterogeneity and 
      inconsistency, and output the results in a variety of formats including league 
      tables and surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA) plots. We provide a 
      demonstration of the functions contained within BUGSnet by recreating a Bayesian NMA 
      found in the second technical support document composed by the National Institute 
      for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit (NICE-DSU). We have also mapped 
      these functions to checklist items within current reporting and best practice 
      guidelines. CONCLUSION: BUGSnet is a new R package that can be used to conduct a 
      Bayesian NMA and produce all of the necessary output needed to satisfy current 
      scientific and regulatory standards. We hope that this software will help to improve 
      the conduct and reporting of NMAs.

TI  - Carfilzomib and dexamethasone versus eight cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone in 
      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma: an indirect comparison using 
      data from the phase 3 ENDEAVOR and CASTOR trials.
PG  - 37-46
LID - 10.1080/10428194.2019.1648806 [doi]
AB  - In ENDEAVOR, carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd56) demonstrated significant 
      improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with bortezomib and 
      dexamethasone (Vd). Both agents were administered until disease progression; the EU 
      label for Vd, however, stipulates a maximum of eight treatment cycles. Here, 
      matching-adjusted treatment comparison was used to compare efficacy of Kd56 with Vd, 
      if Vd was administered for 8 cycles (Vd-8). Data from ENDEAVOR and CASTOR trials 
      (which compared daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone with Vd-8) were used. 
      Hazard ratios of PFS were estimated for Vd vs. Vd-8 and Kd vs. Vd-8. For cycles 1-8, 
      risk reduction in PFS for Kd56 vs. Vd-8 was equal to that estimated in ENDEAVOR (HR: 
      0.53; 95% CI 0.44-0.65). Beyond eight cycles, risk reduction in PFS for Kd56 and 
      Vd-8 was estimated to be 60% (HR: 0.40; 95% CI 0.26-0.63). The analysis suggested 
      that PFS benefit of Kd56 over Vd increases when Vd is given for eight cycles only.

TI  - Value For Money In The Treatment Of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: 
      Assessing The Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness Of IDegLira Versus iGlarLixi In Italy.
PG  - 605-614
LID - 10.2147/CEOR.S218746 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Italian treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) target 
      good glycemic control but acknowledge the associated risk of hypoglycemia. Unlike 
      traditional antidiabetic therapies, modern treatment options such as fixed-ratio 
      combinations of basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists are 
      associated with improved glycemic control, reduced body weight and low risk of 
      hypoglycemia. The cost-effectiveness of the fixed-ratio combinations of basal 
      insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists IDegLira and iGlarLixi was 
      assessed for Italy in patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, to evaluate 
      how short-term clinical benefits translate into long-term health economic outcomes. 
      METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical and economic 
      outcomes over patient lifetimes. Treatment effects were sourced from an indirect 
      treatment comparison. The analysis captured direct medical costs (expressed in 2017 
      Euros) from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS) and 
      patient-related quality of life. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: 
      IDegLira was associated with gains of 0.09 life years and 0.13 quality-adjusted life 
      years (QALYs) relative to iGlarLixi, due to a lower cumulative incidence and delayed 
      onset of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was associated with an incremental 
      cost of EUR 930 over patient lifetimes, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratio of EUR 7,386 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Over the lifetime of patients with 
      T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, IDegLira was associated with improved clinical 
      outcomes at higher costs relative to iGlarLixi. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
      EUR 30,000 per QALY gained, IDegLira was considered to be cost-effective versus 
      iGlarLixi from the perspective of the Italian NHS.

      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1055

LID - 1055
AB  - Background: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was commonly used for en bloc 
      resection in gastric cancer and adenoma with the risk of delayed bleeding after ESD. 
      We conducted a direct and indirect comparison meta-analysis to evaluate the best 
      choice in preventing post-ESD bleeding among proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), 
      histamine(2)-receptor antagonists (H(2)RAs), and the most widely used 
      potassium-competitive acid blocker, vonoprazan. Methods: The Pubmed, Cochrane 
      Library, and Embase were searched for randomized trials. We pooled odds ratios (OR) 
      for preventing post-ESD bleeding using meta-analysis. Results: Sixteen randomized 
      trials met the inclusion criteria including 2,062 patients. Direct comparisons 
      showed slightly significant efficacy in PPIs rather than H(2)RAs in preventing 
      post-ESD bleeding [OR: 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10 to 3.05] and 
      vonoprazan was better than PPIs (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.86). The adjusted 
      indirect comparison indicated vonoprazan was superior to H(2)RAs (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 
      0.12 to 0.74). In subgroup analysis, PPIs had similar efficacy as H(2)RAs in 4 
      weeks, while PPIs were better than H(2)RAs in 8 weeks' treatment (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 
      1.08 to 3.40). The superiority of vonoprazan than PPIs was more significant in 
      combination therapy (OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.69). There was a significant 
      difference in vonoprazan for 8 weeks of medication (OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.92). 
      Conclusions: The effects of vonoprazan is better than PPIs than H(2)RAs in 
      preventing bleeding after ESD. When vonoprazan combined with mucosal protective 
      antiulcer drug in treatment or used in 8 weeks of medication, the efficacy may be 
      even better.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Empagliflozin in Comparison to Sitagliptin and 
      Saxagliptin Based on Cardiovascular Outcome Trials in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes 
      and Established Cardiovascular Disease.
PG  - 2153-2167
LID - 10.1007/s13300-019-00701-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOT) EMPA-REG OUTCOME, TECOS 
      and SAVOR-TIMI 53, empagliflozin [sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor], 
      sitagliptin and saxagliptin [both dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) 
      inhibitors] + standard of care (SoC) were compared to SoC in patients with type 2 
      diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study assessed the 
      cost-effectiveness (CE) of empagliflozin + SoC in comparison to sitagliptin + SoC 
      and saxagliptin + SoC based on the respective CVOT. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes 
      Model (CDM) was calibrated to reproduce the CVOT outcomes. EMPA-REG OUTCOME baseline 
      characteristics and CVOT specific treatment effects on risk factors for 
      cardiovascular disease [glycated haemogloblin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), 
      blood pressure, lipids] were applied. Three-year observed cardiovascular events of 
      empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC were derived from 
      EMPA-REG OUTCOME and an indirect treatment comparison. Relative risk (RR) 
      adjustments to calibrate the CDM were estimated after consecutive attempts of 
      running the model until the observed and CDM-predicted outcomes matched closely. The 
      drug-specific treatment effects were considered up until treatment switch (when 
      HbA1c reached 8.5%), after which, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 
      (UKPDS) 82 risk equations predicted events based on co-existing risk factors and 
      treatment intensification to basal-bolus insulin were applied. The analysis was 
      conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Costs and quality 
      of life data were derived from UK national sources and published literature. A 
      50-year time horizon and discount rate of 3.5% were applied. RESULTS: The CDM 
      projected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 6.408, 5.917 and 5.704 and total 
      costs of 50,801 GBP, 47,627 GBP and 48,071 GBP for empagliflozin + SoC, 
      sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC, respectively. The incremental CE ratio 
      (ICER) of empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC was 
      6464 GBP/QALY and 3878 GBP/QALY, respectively. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
      analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: Results suggest 
      that empagliflozin + SoC is cost-effective compared to sitagliptin + SoC and 
      saxagliptin + SoC at a willingness to pay threshold of 20,000 GBP/QALY. FUNDING:

TI  - Brentuximab vedotin for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory 
      Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplantation.
PG  - 540-549
LID - 10.1111/bjh.16201 [doi]
AB  - Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is the first approved novel agent for salvage treatment of 
      relapsed or refractory (R/R) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) after autologous stem 
      cell transplantation (ASCT). In this study, a literature-based analysis was 
      undertaken to assess, via an indirect treatment comparison, the comparative efficacy 
      of BV to salvage chemotherapy as treatment for R/R cHL patients following ASCT. This 
      comparative effectiveness research was undertaken to support a reimbursement 
      submission for BV to the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. 
      Retrospective analysis of individual patient data from four data sources 
      demonstrated that the use of BV as first salvage treatment in cHL patients relapsing 
      or progressing post-ASCT achieved improvements in both clinical response and overall 
      survival. More specifically, BV was associated with an incremental improvement of 
      22% in overall response rate compared to salvage chemotherapy. Five-year overall 
      survival and progression-free survival rates were 92·2% [95% confidence interval 
      (CI): 85·5-99·3%] and 32·2% (95% CI: 19·1-54·6%) respectively for BV, compared to 
      30·5% (95% CI: 22·2-42·0%) and 3·2% (95% CI: 1·1-8·9%) respectively for salvage 
      chemotherapy. The encouraging results from this conservative analysis have the 
      potential to support informed clinical management and funding decisions for the 
      first salvage of cHL patients demonstrating recurrence after ASCT.

TI  - Modelling Survival of Patients Treated with Adjuvant Nivolumab Who Have Melanoma 
      with Lymph Node Involvement or Metastatic Disease After Complete Resection.
PG  - 343-351
LID - 10.1007/s41669-019-00181-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nivolumab demonstrated significant recurrence-free survival (RFS) 
      gains versus ipilimumab in the CheckMate-238 trial, whereas the CA184-029 trial 
      showed superior RFS gains for ipilimumab versus placebo. No head-to-head trial data 
      were available to compare the efficacy of nivolumab to that of observation, so 
      indirect treatment comparisons were required. Additionally, overall survival (OS) 
      data were not available from CheckMate-238, and the clinical pathway for melanoma 
      has changed significantly over the last decade. Four modelling options were 
      developed using different methods and evidence sources to estimate OS and the impact 
      of nivolumab on predicted life-years in the adjuvant setting; however, this article 
      focuses on two primary methods. METHODS: RFS for nivolumab and observation were 
      informed by a patient-level data meta-regression. The first model was a partitioned 
      survival model, where the parametric OS curve for observation was derived from 
      CA184-029 and nivolumab OS was based on a surrogacy relationship between RFS and OS 
      specific to adjuvant melanoma. The other option used a state-transition model to 
      estimate post-recurrence survival using different data sources. RESULTS: The 
      modelling options estimated different OS for both nivolumab and observation but 
      demonstrated at least a 32% increase in life-years gained for nivolumab versus 
      observation. CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrated the difficulties in modelling 
      within the adjuvant setting. Each model produced different survival projections, 
      showing the need to explore different techniques to address the extent of 
      uncertainty. This also highlighted the importance of understanding the impact of RFS 
      in the long term in a setting where the aim of treatment is to remain disease free.

TI  - Overall survival of glasdegib in combination with low-dose cytarabine, azacitidine, 
      and decitabine among adult patients with previously untreated AML: comparative 
      effectiveness using simulated treatment comparisons.
PG  - 551-565
LID - 10.2147/CEOR.S203482 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Until recently, treatments for older patients with AML ineligible to 
      receive intensive chemotherapies were limited to hypomethylating agents, low-dose 
      cytarabine (LDAC), or clinical trials. In 2018, the FDA approved combination 
      glasdegib (GLAS) plus LDAC based on Phase II results demonstrating improved overall 
      survival (OS) versus LDAC alone in previously untreated AML. However, no randomized 
      clinical trials have directly compared GLAS + LDAC with other AML treatments. 
      OBJECTIVE: Using both indirect treatment comparison (ITC) and simulated treatment 
      comparison (STC), which adjusts for baseline differences between trials, the 
      comparative effectiveness of GLAS + LDAC was compared with hypomethylating agent 
      azacitidine (AZA) or decitabine (DEC). METHODS: A systematic literature review 
      identified published trials of AZA or DEC versus LDAC among older AML patients 
      ineligible for high-intensity chemotherapy. In addition to standard and 
      covariate-adjusted ITC, STC was performed following guidance from the NICE Decision 
      Support Unit (DSU). Using individual patient data from the Phase II GLAS + LDAC 
      study, population-specific OS hazard ratios (HR) for GLAS + LDAC versus AZA or DEC 
      were compared. Furthermore, covariate-adjusted ITC (Cox multivariate models) and STC 
      were repeated using GLAS + LDAC versus LDAC data propensity-weighted for 
      within-trial mean cytogenetic risk. As this initial step was not specified in the 
      DSU, results from this second method were compared to the first STC following DSU 
      guidance only. RESULTS: Standard ITC and STC both demonstrated significantly 
      improved OS for GLAS + LDAC versus either AZA or DEC. Adjusting for key covariates, 
      STC stepwise exponential models demonstrated GLAS + LDAC superiority to both AZA 
      (HR=0.424; 95% CI: 0.228, 0.789) and DEC (HR=0.505; 95% CI: 0.269, 0.949). These 
      significant results held using full or step-wise approaches, following DSU guidance 
      only or the weighted STC approach. CONCLUSION: Using ITC and STC, GLAS + LDAC 
      demonstrated superior OS to AZA or DEC in an adult population with previously 
      untreated AML for whom intensive chemotherapy is not an option.

TI  - Assessment-Schedule Matching in Unanchored Indirect Treatment Comparisons of 
      Progression-Free Survival in Cancer Studies.
PG  - 1537-1551
LID - 10.1007/s40273-019-00831-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The timing of efficacy-related clinical events recorded at scheduled 
      study visits in clinical trials are interval censored, with the interval duration 
      pre-determined by the study protocol. Events may happen any time during that 
      interval but can only be detected during a planned or unplanned visit. Disease 
      progression in oncology is a notable example where the time to an event is affected 
      by the schedule of visits within a study. This can become a source of bias when 
      studies with varying assessment schedules are used in unanchored comparisons using 
      methods such as matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. OBJECTIVE: We illustrate 
      assessment-time bias (ATB) in a simulation study based on data from a recent study 
      in second-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, 
      and present a method to adjust for differences in assessment schedule when comparing 
      progression-free survival (PFS) against a competing treatment. METHODS: A 
      multi-state model for death and progression was used to generate simulated death and 
      progression times, from which PFS times were derived. PFS data were also generated 
      for a hypothetical comparator treatment by applying a constant hazard ratio (HR) to 
      the baseline treatment. Simulated PFS times for the two treatments were then aligned 
      to different assessment schedules so that progression events were only observed at 
      set visit times, and the data were analysed to assess the bias and standard error of 
      estimates of HRs between two treatments with and without assessment-schedule 
      matching (ASM). RESULTS: ATB is highly affected by the rate of the event at the 
      first assessment time; in our examples, the bias ranged from 3 to 11% as the event 
      rate increased. The proposed method relies on individual-level data from a study and 
      attempts to adjust the timing of progression events to the comparator's schedule by 
      shifting them forward or backward without altering the patients' actual follow-up 
      time. The method removed the bias almost completely in all scenarios without 
      affecting the precision of estimates of comparative effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Considering the increasing use of unanchored comparative analyses for novel cancer 
      treatments based on single-arm studies, the proposed method offers a relatively 
      simple means of improving the accuracy of relative benefits of treatments on 
      progression times.

AB  - Objective: To determine the efficacy of pembrolizumab relative to other treatments 
      used in stage III melanoma by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) and 
      network meta-analysis (NMA). Methods: A SLR was conducted to identify randomized 
      clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating approved adjuvant treatments including 
      interferon-containing regimens, BRAF-inhibitors, and PD-L1 inhibitors in stage III 
      melanoma patients. Relative treatment effects for recurrence-free survival (RFS) 
      were synthesized with Bayesian NMA models that allowed for hazard ratios (HRs) to 
      vary over time. Results: Included studies formed a connected network of evidence 
      composed of eight trials. In high-risk stage III patients, the HR for pembrolizumab 
      vs observation decreased significantly over time with the superiority of 
      pembrolizumab over observation becoming statistically meaningful before 3 months. By 
      9 months, the HR for pembrolizumab vs observation was statistically significantly 
      lower than the HR for most other treatments vs observation, with the exception of 
      ipilimumab and biochemotherapy due to overlapping 95% credible intervals. In 
      BRAF + patients, pembrolizumab was statistically significantly better than 
      observation after 3 months. The HR for both BRAF-inhibitors vs observation increased 
      significantly over time and pembrolizumab was statistically superior to both 
      BRAF-inhibitors after 15 months. Conclusions: Pembrolizumab results in statistically 
      significantly improved RFS compared to all competing regimens after 9 months, except 
      ipilimumab and biochemotherapy, for the adjuvant treatment of stage III melanoma. 
      However, point estimate HRs vs observation for pembrolizumab are much lower than 
      those for ipilimumab. In BRAF + patients, the advantage of pembrolizumab versus 
      competing interventions increases over time with respect to RFS.

TI  - Indirect treatment comparison of valbenazine and deutetrabenazine efficacy and 
      safety in tardive dyskinesia.
PG  - 1077-1088
LID - 10.2217/cer-2019-0059 [doi]
AB  - Aim: Utilize the Bucher indirect treatment comparison (ITC) method to compare 
      valbenazine and deutetrabenazine efficacy using clinical trial data. Methods: 
      Outcomes included mean change from baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale 
      (AIMS) total score, AIMS response (≥50% improvement), clinical global impression of 
      change response (score ≤2) and safety outcomes. Data were pooled by trial and dose; 
      outcomes were analyzed at multiple time points. Results: ITC of AIMS score 
      improvement significantly favored valbenazine 80 mg/day at 6 weeks versus 
      deutetrabenazine 36 mg/day at 8 weeks, while valbenazine 40 mg/day was statistically 
      similar to all doses of deutetrabenazine at all time points. No significant 
      differences between drugs were found in AIMS and clinical global impression of 
      change responses and safety outcomes. Conclusion: In this ITC of pooled trial data, 
      valbenazine was generally favorable over deutetrabenazine, although dose titration 
      and equivalency should be considered when interpreting results.

TI  - Indirect Treatment Comparison of Nivolumab Versus Observation or Ipilimumab as 
      Adjuvant Therapy in Resected Melanoma Using Pooled Clinical Trial Data.
PG  - 2783-2796
LID - 10.1007/s12325-019-01060-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nivolumab has been approved in patients with melanoma with lymph node 
      involvement or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection, in the 
      adjuvant setting. A pivotal trial compared nivolumab with ipilimumab; however, no 
      head-to-head trial exists comparing nivolumab to observation, a common comparator in 
      the adjuvant setting. Here, we compared the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of 
      nivolumab with observation or ipilimumab as adjuvant therapies in resected stage 
      IIIB/C melanoma. METHODS: Patient data were pooled from the EORTC 18071 and 
      CheckMate 238 trials using propensity score weighting and adjusting for cross-trial 
      differences. Number needed to treat (NNT) and costs per recurrence-free life-month 
      (RFLM) at 12, 16, 18, and 24 months (as data allowed) were estimated. Costs included 
      drug acquisition, administration costs, and direct medical costs. Sensitivity 
      analyses including patients with stage IIIB/C and resected stage IV melanoma were 
      conducted. RESULTS: A total of 1287 patients (278 nivolumab, 365 observation, and 
      644 ipilimumab) with resected stage IIIB/C melanoma were pooled. NNTs to achieve one 
      additional recurrence-free survivor with nivolumab versus observation were 3.93 at 
      12 months and 3.42 at 24 months; NNTs for nivolumab versus ipilimumab were 7.97 at 
      12 months and 6.43 at 24 months. Mean drug costs per RFLM were lower for nivolumab 
      at 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively (nivolumab: $13,447, $9462, and $7370; 
      ipilimumab: $52,734, $40,484, and $33,875). Mean medical costs per RFLM were the 
      lowest for nivolumab versus observation or ipilimumab at 12 months ($449 versus $674 
      or $1531) and 16 months ($383 versus $808 or $1316). The sensitivity analysis 
      results were consistent with the base case. CONCLUSION: For resected melanoma, 
      adjuvant nivolumab is both clinically effective and cost-effective compared with 
      observation or ipilimumab. Adjuvant nivolumab was associated with a lower drug cost 
      per RFLM compared with ipilimumab, and a lower medical cost compared with 
      observation. Future analyses incorporating long-term follow-up data may help 
      increase understanding of the economic impact of nivolumab in the adjuvant setting.

TI  - Acupuncture versus propranolol in migraine prophylaxis: an indirect treatment 
      comparison meta-analysis.
PG  - 14-25
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09510-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Propranolol is recommended as first-line treatment for preventing 
      migraine attacks; acupuncture has not been compared with propranolol in a 
      head-to-head trial. OBJECTIVE: To compare acupuncture with propranolol using 
      indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Randomized controlled 
      trials comparing acupuncture or propranolol with sham acupuncture, placebo, 
      waiting-list control or usual care were included. We extracted information from the 
      included trials using a standardized extraction form. The primary outcome was 
      migraine episodes. The secondary outcomes included migraine days, migraine 
      frequency, and adverse events. RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs (n = 3656) after 
      screening 1078 articles. The analysis showed that acupuncture had a significant 
      advantage over propranolol in reducing migraine episodes over a 4-week period (SMD - 
      0.74, 95% CI - 1.04 to - 0.44). Acupuncture also had a significant advantage over 
      waiting-list control in decreasing migraine frequency (SMD - 1.57, 95% CI - 2.08 to 
      - 1.06). Acupuncture caused fewer adverse events than propranolol (RR 0.82, 95% CI 
      0.11-5.94). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture had a better effect than propranolol in 
      reducing migraine episodes in indirect comparison. The result should be confirmed in 
      subsequent head-to-head studies. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42018108585.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons of annualized bleeding rate and utilization 
      of BAY 94-9027 versus three recombinant factor VIII agents for prophylaxis in 
      patients with severe hemophilia A.
PG  - 147-159
LID - 10.2147/JBM.S206806 [doi]
AB  - Background: BAY 94-9027 is an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) 
      that prevents bleeding in persons with hemophilia A at twice-weekly, 5-day, and 
      7-day dosing intervals. In rare diseases such as hemophilia, where small populations 
      preclude head-to-head comparisons in randomized controlled trials, outcomes from 
      different studies can be compared by matching-adjusted indirect treatment 
      comparisons (MAICs) via matched summary statistics of individual patient data. This 
      study compared MAIC-adjusted outcomes of BAY 94-9027 with other FVIII agents for 
      prophylaxis of hemophilia. Methods: Weighted patient data from the BAY 94-9027 
      PROTECT VIII trial were used to compare annualized bleeding rates (ABRs), percentage 
      of patients with zero bleeds, and factor utilization against published data on 
      rFVIII-Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc), BAX 855, and recombinant antihemophilic 
      factor/plasma/albumin-free method (rAHF-PFM). Results: After matching BAY 94-9027 
      and comparators, the mean BAY 94-9027 utilization was significantly lower than 
      rFVIIIFc pre- and post-matching (66.2 vs 82.2 IU/kg/week; 66.5 vs 82.2 IU/kg/week; 
      both P<0.001). Median BAY 94-9027 utilization (IU/kg/week) trended lower than BAX 
      855 (64.3 vs 87.4) and rAHF-PFM (2004 study: 64.0 vs 107.5; 2012 study: 63.6 vs 
      109.9). Mean ABRs and percentages of patients with zero bleeds were similar 
      post-matching between BAY 94-9027 and comparators. Conclusion: BAY 94-9027 
      demonstrated similar MAIC-adjusted ABR with lower utilization than rFVIIIFc, BAX 
      855, and rAHF-PFM.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab for Patients with Advanced, Unresectable, or 
      Metastatic Urothelial Cancer Ineligible for Cisplatin-based Therapy.
PG  - 565-571
LID - S2588-9311(18)30169-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.euo.2018.09.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for effective therapies for patients with 
      advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who cannot tolerate cisplatin-based 
      chemotherapy. Cisplatin-ineligible patients experience a high frequency of adverse 
      events from the most commonly used standard of care treatment, carboplatin plus 
      gemcitabine, or alternative treatment with gemcitabine monotherapy. Pembrolizumab is 
      a potent, highly selective humanised monoclonal antibody that releases checkpoint 
      inhibition of the immune response system, and provides a new alternative for these 
      patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for 
      first-line treatment of urothelial carcinoma ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy 
      in patients with strongly PD-L1-positive tumours in Sweden. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Parametric survival curves were fitted to overall survival, 
      progression-free survival, and time on treatment data from KEYNOTE-052 to 
      extrapolate clinical outcomes. A simulated treatment comparison and a network 
      meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of pembrolizumab 
      versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine monotherapy. EQ-5D data from 
      KEYNOTE-052 were used to estimate utility, while resource use and cost inputs were 
      estimated using Swedish regional pricing lists and clinician opinion. OUTCOME 
      MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The model reported costs, life years, and 
      quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and results were tested using deterministic and 
      probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We estimated that 
      pembrolizumab would improve survival by 2.11 and 2.16 years and increase QALYs by 
      1.71 and 1.75 compared to carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine monotherapy, 
      respectively. Pembrolizumab was associated with a cost increase of €90520 versus 
      carboplatin plus gemcitabine and €95055 versus gemcitabine, with corresponding 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of €53055/QALY and €54415/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: 
      At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €100000/QALY, pembrolizumab is a cost-effective 
      treatment versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and versus gemcitabine. PATIENT 
      SUMMARY: This is the first analysis to show that pembrolizumab is a cost-effective 
      option for first-line treatment of cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally 
      advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in Sweden.

TI  - Choice of Methodology Impacts Outcome in Indirect Comparisons of Drugs for 
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/medicina55080443 [doi]
LID - 443
AB  - Background and Objectives: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic 
      condition leading to lung damage and deterioration in lung function. Following the 
      availability of two new drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone, a number of network 
      meta-analyses (NMAs) of randomised controlled trials have been published which have 
      conducted indirect comparisons on the two drugs. Differing recommendations from 
      these studies are potentially confusing to clinicians and decision-makers. We aimed 
      to systematically review published NMAs of IPF treatments, to compare their findings 
      and summarise key recommendations. Materials and Methods: We systematically reviewed 
      (PROSPERO: CRD42017072876) six eligible NMAs and investigated the differences in 
      their findings with respect to key endpoints. We focused on differences in 
      head-to-head comparisons between nintedanib and pirfenidone. Results: The NMAs were 
      broadly consistent, with most differences being explained by model choice, endpoint 
      definitions, inclusion of different studies, different follow-up durations, and 
      access to unpublished data. A substantive difference remained, however, in the 
      change from baseline forced vital capacity (FVC). One NMA favoured nintedanib, 
      another found no statistical difference, whilst others did not conduct the analysis. 
      These differences can be attributed to the choice of methodology, the use of the 
      standardised mean difference (SMD) scale, and population heterogeneity. Conclusions: 
      NMA methods facilitated the comparison of nintedanib and pirfenidone in the absence 
      of a head-to-head trial. However, further work is needed to determine whether the 
      trial populations are homogeneous and whether the SMD is appropriate in this 
      population. Differences in patient characteristics may obscure the difference in 
      treatment effects. To assist decision-makers, an exploration of efficacy in 
      real-world populations may be prudent.

TI  - Assessing the impact of a matching-adjusted indirect comparison in a Bayesian 
      network meta-analysis.
PG  - 546-568
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1372 [doi]
AB  - If IPD is available for some or all trials in a network meta-analysis (NMA), then 
      incorporating this IPD into an NMA is routinely considered to be preferable. 
      However, the situation often arises where a researcher has IPD for trials concerning 
      a particular treatment (eg, from a sponsor) but none for other trials. Therefore, 
      one can reweight the IPD so that the covariate characteristics in the IPD trials 
      match that of the aggregate data (AgD) trials, using a matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison (MAIC). We assess the impact of using the reweighted aggregated data, 
      obtained by the MAIC, in a Bayesian NMA for a connected treatment network. We apply 
      this method to a network of multiple myeloma treatments in newly diagnosed patients 
      (ndMM), where the outcome is progression free survival. We investigate the 
      reliability of the methods and results through a simulation study. The ndMM network 
      consists of three IPD studies comparing lenalidomide to placebo (Len-Placebo), one 
      AgD study comparing Len-Placebo, and one AgD study comparing thalidomide to placebo 
      (Thal-Placebo). We therefore investigate two options of weighting the covariates: 
      (a) All three studies are weighted separately to match the AgD Thal-Placebo trial. 
      (b) Patients are weighted across all three IPD studies to match the AgD Thal-Placebo 
      trial, but the NMA considers each trial separately. We observe limited benefit to 
      MAIC in the full network population. While MAIC can be beneficial as a sensitivity 
      analysis to confirm results across patient populations, we advise that MAIC is used 
      and interpreted with caution.

PG  - 113-121
LID - 10.5152/eurjrheum.2019.19057 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) can be used to assess the 
      comparative effectiveness of two treatments indirectly using data from randomized 
      placebo-controlled trials. This MAIC assessed the comparative effectiveness of 
      secukinumab (an anti-interleukin-17A) and etanercept (a tumor necrosis factor 
      inhibitor) in a target population of biologic-naïve patients with psoriatic 
      arthritis (PsA). METHODS: Individual patient data pooled from FUTURE 2 
      (NCT01752634), FUTURE 3 (NCT01989468), and FUTURE 5 (NCT02404350) (secukinumab: 150 
      mg, n=458 and 300 mg, n=461) were matched to data from the population in the 
      NCT00317499 trial (etanercept 25 mg, n=101) using MAIC methodology, by adjusting for 
      clinical and demographic baseline characteristics. Recalculated outcomes from FUTURE 
      2, 3, and 5 (150 mg, effective sample size (ESS) post-matching=104; 300 mg, ESS=75; 
      and placebo, ESS=159) were compared with the NCT00317499 trial. Pairwise comparisons 
      using odds ratios (ORs) were performed for the American College of Rheumatology 
      (ACR) 20, 50, and 70 response criteria at week 12 (placebo-adjusted) and week 24 
      (non-placebo-adjusted). RESULTS: At week 12, there were no significant differences 
      in ACR responses between secukinumab and etanercept. There was no significant 
      difference between secukinumab 150 mg and etanercept at week 24 with respect to ACR 
      20 and 50 response rates; however, ACR 70 response rates were higher for secukinumab 
      150 mg (OR (95% confidence interval (CI)): 4.48 (2.01-9.99), p<0.001). ACR 20, 50, 
      and 70 response rates were higher with secukinumab 300 mg than with etanercept at 
      this time point (OR (95% CI): ACR 20, 3.28 (1.69-6.38), p<0.001; ACR 50, 1.90 
      (1.04-3.50), p=0.038; and ACR 70, 3.56 (1.51-8.40), p=0.004). CONCLUSION: In this 
      MAIC, secukinumab was associated with higher ACR 20 and 50 (secukinumab 300 mg) and 
      70 (secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg) response rates at week 24 than etanercept in 
      biologic-naïve patients with active PsA, whereas no significant difference was 
      observed in the short-term at week 12.

TI  - Comparing the efficacy of bag-valve mask, endotracheal intubation, and laryngeal 
      mask airway for subjects with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: an indirect 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 257
LID - 10.21037/atm.2019.05.21 [doi]
LID - 257
AB  - BACKGROUND: For subjects with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), bag-valve mask 
      (BVM), endotracheal intubation (ETI), and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) are the most 
      common methods of ventilatory support; however, the best choice remains 
      controversial. METHODS: A comprehensive search of online databases was performed. A 
      traditional meta-analysis was performed to determine the risk ratio of BVM vs. LMA 
      and ETI vs. LMA. Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) were conducted to compare BVM 
      and ETI. RESULTS: A total of 13 full-text articles reporting the efficacy of BVM, 
      ETI, and LMA were considered in this analysis. BVM and LMA had the same effect 
      regarding return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (23% vs. 24%; RR =0.84), survival 
      rate at admission (19% vs. 21%; RR =0.82) or discharge (6% vs. 4%; RR =0.61). ETI 
      was superior to LMA in terms of ROSC (48% vs. 23%; RR =0.72) and survival rate at 
      both admission (27% vs. 19%; RR =0.85) and discharge (12% vs. 4%; RR =0.90). BVM was 
      inferior to ETI in terms of ROSC (24% vs. 48%; RR =0.86), survival to admission rate 
      (21% vs. 27%; RR =1.037), and survival to discharge rate (6% vs. 12%; RR =1.476). 
      CONCLUSIONS: ETI should be considered for airway management as early as possible, 
      which can improve the subject's success rate of recovery and survival to admission 
      rate. In future, large-scale, multi-center, randomized controlled studies should be 
      conducted to evaluate the exact efficacy of BVM, ETI, and LMA for the first aid of 
      subjects with OHCA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is common, with it being the 2nd most prevalent 
      cancer in men worldwide and the 6th leading cause of death in men. Screening for any 
      type of cancer aims to increase the chances of successful treatment through early 
      detection of the disease. There were some systematic reviews (SRs) evaluated the 
      diagnostic value of biomarkers for the diagnosis of PCa and no studies have been 
      conducted to analyze the quality of these SRs. We are not clear which kind of marker 
      is the best choice. Thus, this study aims to assess the methodologic quality of the 
      SRs and reanalyze the published data based on SRs for the biomarkers to find the 
      optimal biomarker for the early diagnosis of PCa. METHODS: We performed a systematic 
      literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library and to 
      identify relevant SRs from inception to April 2019. Diagnostic accuracy studies 
      included any type of single biomarker or combined biomarkers aimed at evaluating the 
      diagnostic value is considered eligible for this overview. The Assessment of 
      Multiple Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) instrument will be used to evaluate the 
      risk of bias of the included SRs. Standard pairwise meta-analysis and adjusted 
      indirect comparison will be used to compare the diagnostic value of different 
      biomarkers. RESULTS: The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed 
      journal for publication. CONCLUSION: This study will reanalyze the published data 
      based on SRs. We hope that the results will help find a biomarker with the superior 
      diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of PCa. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Systematic literature review of clinical trials of endocrine therapies for 
      premenopausal women with metastatic HR+ HER2- breast cancer.
PG  - 880-888
LID - 10.1111/tbj.13345 [doi]
AB  - Several endocrine-based therapies have recently been evaluated as treatments for 
      premenopausal women with 
      hormone-receptor-positive/human-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor 2 negative 
      (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (mBC). We conducted a systematic review and 
      assessed the feasibility of an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) to characterize 
      the comparative efficacy of endocrine-based therapies in this setting. A systematic 
      literature review (SLR) of Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and key conferences was 
      performed to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) satisfying the following 
      criteria: (a) included pre/perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC, (b) included 
      endocrine-based therapies, (c) reported efficacy, safety, or quality of life 
      outcomes, and (d) was published in 2007 or later (when HER2 testing was 
      standardized). The clinical and methodological similarities across trials were 
      assessed to evaluate the feasibility of an ITC. Four RCTs (PALOMA-3, MONARCH-2, KCSG 
      BR10-04 and MONALEESA-7) and eight regimens (palbociclib + fulvestrant + goserelin, 
      fulvestrant + goserelin, abemaciclib + fulvestrant + gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
      agonist [GnRHa], fulvestrant + GnRHa, anastrozole + goserelin, goserelin, 
      ribociclib + NSAI/tamoxifen + goserelin and NSAI/tamoxifen + goserelin) were 
      selected. MONALEESA-7 was the only phase 3 trial investigating endocrine-based 
      therapies as first-line in only pre/perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC; the 
      other three trials focused on the ET-failure setting and their pre/perimenopausal 
      populations were relatively small. ITCs were methodologically unfeasible due to 
      critical differences in treatment settings and lack of common comparators across 
      trials. Therefore, we were not able to characterize the relative efficacy of the 
      different endocrine-based therapies available in the premenopausal HR+/HER2- mBC 
      setting. This systematic review provides a comprehensive assessment of the available 
      trial evidence on the efficacy and safety of endocrine-based therapies for 
      premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC. Only four trials have reported relevant data 
      in this setting, and MONALEESA-7 is currently the only trial focused on 
      premenopausal HR+ HER2- mBC in the first-line setting.

TI  - A Fast and Easy ATP-Based Approach Enables MIC Testing for Non-resuscitating VBNC 
      Pathogens.
PG  - 1365
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2019.01365 [doi]

AB  - Many bacteria enter the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state to maximize resources 
      and increase their tolerance to harmful conditions to cope with environmental 
      stress, which has been described for a plethora of important human and foodborne 
      pathogens. VBNC pathogens can potentially present a serious risk to human health as 
      they are invisible to routine microbiological culture-based methods. Of high 
      importance is the increased tolerance to antibiotics or disinfectant measures while 
      in the VBNC state. The greatest remaining challenge for such investigations is the 
      lack of an appropriate, cost-effective multi-species screening method due to 
      experimental constraints. In this study, we investigated if de novo ATP production 
      of cells in the VBNC state is a suitable indicator for overall cell viability that 
      can be utilized to determine the minimum ATP inhibitory concentration (MAIC) of 
      antibiotics and other antimicrobials. To validate this approach, heat-stress 
      time-kill experiments were performed with both culturable and VBNC cells. We 
      developed a comprehensive experimental setup and demonstrated the applicability of 
      this VBNC-MIC assay for testing the tolerance of 12 strains of 4 important bacterial 
      species (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria 
      monocytogenes) in the VBNC state to eight important antimicrobials including four 
      different antibiotics. We confirmed that bacteria in the VBNC state were resistant 
      to all tested antibiotics (ampicillin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin) and 
      additionally insensitive to disinfectants (benzalkonium chloride and 
      trioctylmethylammonium chloride) and preservatives (bronopol and sodium azide). 
      These data emphasize the need for further research regarding the characteristics of 
      bacterial pathogens in the VBNC state and present the advantages and high-throughput 
      capabilities of ATP determinations to investigate tolerance of VBNC pathogens to 
      antimicrobials. The presented method should be helpful in order to identify 
      appropriate countermeasures, treatments, or disinfectants when confronted with 
      bacterial pathogens in the VBNC state.

AB  - Indirect treatment comparisons are useful to estimate relative treatment effects 
      when head-to-head studies are not conducted. Statisticians at the National Centre 
      for Pharmacoeconomics Ireland (NCPE) and Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) assess 
      the clinical and cost-effectiveness of new medicines as part of multidisciplinary 
      teams. We describe some shared observations on areas where reporting of 
      population-adjustment indirect comparison methods is causing uncertainty in our 
      recommendations to decision-making committees when assessing reimbursement of 
      medicines.

TI  - Cost Effectiveness of Blinatumomab Versus Inotuzumab Ozogamicin in Adult Patients 
      with Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in the 
      United States.
PG  - 1177-1193
LID - 10.1007/s40273-019-00812-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The TOWER and INO-VATE-ALL trials demonstrated the 
      efficacy and safety of blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin (inotuzumab), 
      respectively, versus standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy in adults with relapsed or 
      refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The cost 
      effectiveness of blinatumomab versus inotuzumab has not previously been examined. 
      METHODS: Cost effectiveness of blinatumomab versus inotuzumab in R/R B-cell 
      precursor ALL patients with one or no prior salvage therapy from a United States 
      (US) payer perspective was estimated using a partitioned survival model. Health 
      outcomes were estimated based on published aggregate data from INO-VATE-ALL and 
      individual patient data from TOWER weighted to match patients in INO-VATE-ALL using 
      matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). Analyses were conducted using five 
      approaches relating to use of anchored versus unanchored comparisons of health 
      outcomes and, for the anchored comparisons, the reference treatment to which 
      treatment effects on health outcomes were applied. Estimates from TOWER including 
      the probabilities of complete remission and allogeneic stem-cell transplant 
      (allo-SCT), overall and event-free survival, utilities, duration of therapy, and use 
      of subsequent therapies were MAIC adjusted to match INO-VATE-ALL. Costs of 
      treatment, adverse events, allo-SCT, subsequent therapies, and terminal care were 
      from published sources. A 50-year time horizon and 3% annual discount rate were 
      used. RESULTS: Incremental costs for blinatumomab versus inotuzumab ranged from 
      US$7023 to US$36,244, depending on the approach used for estimating relative 
      effectiveness. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) ranged from 0.54 to 
      1.78. Cost effectiveness for blinatumomab versus inotuzumab ranged from US$4006 to 
      US$20,737 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Blinatumomab is estimated to be cost 
      effective versus inotuzumab in R/R B-cell precursor ALL adults who have received one 
      or no prior salvage therapy from a US payer perspective.

TI  - Initiating tocilizumab, with or without methotrexate, compared with starting 
      methotrexate with prednisone within step-up treatment strategies in early rheumatoid 
      arthritis: an indirect comparison of effectiveness and safety of the U-Act-Early and 
      CAMERA-II treat-to-target trials.
PG  - 1333-1338

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Methotrexate (MTX), often combined with low moderately dosed prednisone, 
      is still the cornerstone of initial treatment for early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
      It is not known how this strategy compares with initial treatment with a biological. 
      We therefore compared the effectiveness of tocilizumab (TCZ), or TCZ plus MTX 
      (TCZ+MTX) with MTX plus 10 mg prednisone (MTX+pred), all initiated within a 
      treat-to-target treatment strategy in early RA. METHODS: Using individual patient 
      data of two trials, we indirectly compared tight-controlled treat-to-target 
      strategies initiating TCZ (n=103), TCZ+MTX (n=106) or MTX+pred (n=117), using 
      initiation of MTX (n=227) as reference. Primary outcome was Disease Activity Score 
      assessing 28 joints (DAS28) over 24 months. To assess the influence of acute phase 
      reactants (APRs), a disease activity composite outcome score without APR (ie, 
      modification of the Clinical Disease Activity Index (m-CDAI)) was analysed. 
      Secondary outcomes were remission (several definitions), physical function and 
      radiographic progression. Multilevel models were used to account for clustering 
      within trials and patients over time, correcting for relevant confounders. RESULTS: 
      DAS28 over 24 months was lower for TCZ+MTX than for MTX+Pred (mean difference: -0.62 
      (95% CI -1.14 to -0.10)). Remission was more often achieved in TCZ+MTX and in TCZ 
      versus MTX+pred (p=0.02/0.05, respectively). Excluding APRs from the disease 
      activity outcome score, TCZ-based strategies showed a slightly higher m-CDAI 
      compared with MTX+pred, but this was not statistically significant. Other outcomes 
      were also not statistically significantly different between the strategies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early RA, although TCZ-based strategies resulted in 
      better DAS28 and remission rates compared with MTX+pred, at least part of these 
      effects may be due to a specific effect of TCZ on APRs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world, 
      with 694,000 deaths each year. Despite improvements in treatment strategies in 
      recent years, the overall survival rate of CRC is still very low and the survival 
      rate is highly dependent on the stage at the time of diagnosis. Some biomarkers have 
      shown great potential for early screening of CRC and some have been tested in 
      systematic reviews (SRs). However, the quality of these SRs remains unclear and 
      these SRs did not clarify which biomarker is the optimal diagnostic test. This 
      overview will evaluate the methodological quality of available SRs and compare the 
      diagnostic value of different biomarkers in order to find the best biomarker for 
      diagnosing CRC. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search for SRs published before 
      February 2019 was conducted in the PubMed, Embase.com, Cochrane Library, and Web of 
      Science without any language restrictions. We will use the assessment of multiple 
      systematic reviews-2 instrument to assess the methodological quality of each SR. 
      Bubble plots will be used to summarize the main characteristics and quality of SRs. 
      Standard pairwise meta-analysis and adjusted indirect comparison will be conducted 
      to compare the diagnostic value of different biomarkers. RESULTS: The results of 
      this overview will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. 
      CONCLUSION: The findings of this project will provide a general overview and 
      evidence of the diagnostic value of biomarkers in detecting CRC. PROSPERO

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly invasive tumor caused 
      primarily by asbestos exposure. In recent decades, the incidence of MPM has shown an 
      increasing trend, posing a great threat to human health. Although there is currently 
      no effective way to treat MPM, patients can survive for more than 5 years if the 
      tumor is removed early. Several systematic reviews (SRs) have evaluated the 
      diagnostic value of biomarkers for diagnosing MPM. However, no studies have been 
      conducted to analyze the quality of these SRs and it remains unclear which biomarker 
      is the excellent diagnostic test. This study aims to assess the methodological 
      quality of the SRs and reanalyze the published data based on SRs to find the optimal 
      biomarker for the early diagnosis of MPM. METHODS: A systematic search will be 
      performed in PubMed, Embase.com, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, and Web 
      of Science to identify SRs reporting value of biomarkers for detecting MPM. We will 
      evaluate the risk of bias of the included SRs according to the Assessment of 
      Multiple Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) instrument. Standard pairwise meta-analysis 
      and adjusted indirect comparison will be used to compare the diagnostic value of 
      different biomarkers. RESULTS: The results of this study will be submitted to a

TI  - Population Adjustment Methods for Indirect Comparisons: A Review of National 
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence Technology Appraisals.
PG  - 221-228
LID - 10.1017/S0266462319000333 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Indirect comparisons via a common comparator (anchored comparisons) are 
      commonly used in health technology assessment. However, common comparators may not 
      be available, or the comparison may be biased due to differences in effect modifiers 
      between the included studies. Recently proposed population adjustment methods aim to 
      adjust for differences between study populations in the situation where individual 
      patient data are available from at least one study, but not all studies. They can 
      also be used when there is no common comparator or for single-arm studies 
      (unanchored comparisons). We aim to characterise the use of population adjustment 
      methods in technology appraisals (TAs) submitted to the United Kingdom National 
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). METHODS: We reviewed NICE TAs 
      published between 01/01/2010 and 20/04/2018. RESULTS: Population adjustment methods 
      were used in 7 percent (18/268) of TAs. Most applications used unanchored 
      comparisons (89 percent, 16/18), and were in oncology (83 percent, 15/18). Methods 
      used included matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (89 percent, 16/18) and 
      simulated treatment comparisons (17 percent, 3/18). Covariates were included based 
      on: availability, expert opinion, effective sample size, statistical significance, 
      or cross-validation. Larger treatment networks were commonplace (56 percent, 10/18), 
      but current methods cannot account for this. Appraisal committees received results 
      of population-adjusted analyses with caution and typically looked for greater cost 
      effectiveness to minimise decision risk. CONCLUSIONS: Population adjustment methods 
      are becoming increasingly common in NICE TAs, although their impact on decisions has 
      been limited to date. Further research is needed to improve upon current methods, 
      and to investigate their properties in simulation studies.

TI  - Cost Effectiveness of the Third-Generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) 
      Ponatinib, vs. Second-Generation TKIs or Stem Cell Transplant, as Third-Line 
      Treatment for Chronic-Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.
PG  - 555-567
LID - 10.1007/s40258-019-00489-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Third-line treatment options for patients with 
      chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia include tyrosine kinase inhibitors and 
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). The objective of this 
      study was to develop a Markov model with a lifetime time horizon to assess the cost 
      effectiveness of ponatinib for third-line chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia vs. 
      second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) or 
      alloHSCT from the public healthcare system perspective in Germany, Sweden, and 
      Canada. METHODS: Clinical outcomes were derived from the literature, and from 
      patient-level data (phase II PACE trial) for ponatinib. Resource use included drugs, 
      alloHSCT, monitoring and follow-up, adverse events, and end-of-life care; costs were 
      based on national tariffs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using 
      chronic myeloid leukemia health-state utilities from an international time-trade-off 
      study. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum for Germany and Sweden, 
      and 5% for Canada. RESULTS: Ponatinib yielded more discounted QALYs than any 
      second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor/alloHSCT in all three countries, mainly 
      owing to better response rates and longer durations of response. Incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors were US$21,543-37,755/QALY in Germany, $24,018-38,227/QALY in Sweden, and 
      $43,001-58,515/QALY in Canada. Ponatinib was dominant over alloHSCT in Germany, 
      while incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. alloHSCT in Sweden and 
      Canada were $715/QALY and $31,534/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib may 
      improve outcomes (mainly because of higher response rates and longer response 
      durations) at an acceptable cost level compared with other third-line treatment 
      options for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia in Germany, Sweden, and Canada; 
      however, the lack of an indirect comparison is a limitation of our study.

TI  - Adjusted indirect comparisons to assess bioequivalence between generic clopidogrel 
      products in Serbia.
PG  - 2059-2065
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13997 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Generic products can be regarded as therapeutically equivalent and switchable 
      with the reference product. However, switchability between generics is unknown, as 
      direct comparisons between generics are not performed. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the bioequivalence between generic clopidogrel products by means of 
      adjusted indirect comparisons (AICs). METHODS: AICs were conducted to assess 
      bioequivalence between 4 generic clopidogrel products that are authorised in Serbia. 
      Generics are considered equivalent to the reference if the 90% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) for the ratios test/reference of the maximum concentration (C(max) ) and area 
      under the curve up to the last measurable concentration (AUC(0-t) ) fall within the 
      acceptance range 80.00-125.00%. However, for AICs between generics, the Canadian 
      acceptance criterion for C(max) was employed, where only the point estimate of 
      C(max) needs to be within 80.00-125.00%. RESULTS: The 90% CIs of the AICs 
      demonstrated bioequivalence within 80.00-125.00% for all AUC(0-t) comparisons. The 
      point estimates of C(max) in all AICs were also within this range. CONCLUSION: This 
      study demonstrates that the bioavailability of these 4 generic clopidogrel products 
      authorised in Serbia is very similar. Despite the limited power of AICs, 
      bioequivalence was demonstrated for all 90% CIs of AUC(0-t) and all 90% CIs of 
      C(max) comparisons were within or very close to the acceptance range, being able to 
      comply with the acceptance criterion employed in Canada for C(max) . Therefore, 
      these 4 generic clopidogrel products authorised in Serbia can be considered 
      switchable with each other in clinical practice based on the adjusted indirect 
      comparisons.

TI  - Indirect Treatment Comparison of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Versus Blinatumomab for 
      Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
PG  - 2147-2160
LID - 10.1007/s12325-019-00991-w [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: No head-to-head studies have compared inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) and 
      blinatumomab (Blina) for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory B cell 
      precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs), 
      namely network meta-analysis (NMA), anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      (MAIC), and simulated treatment comparison (STC), were conducted to compare the 
      relative efficacy of these therapies. METHODS: Patient-level data from a study that 
      evaluated InO with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy (INO-VATE-ALL) and published 
      data from a study that evaluated Blina with SoC chemotherapy (TOWER) were used in 
      the analyses. Endpoints evaluated included remission rate defined as complete 
      remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi), 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), overall survival (OS), and 
      event-free survival (EFS). For each outcome, treatment-effect modifiers were 
      adjusted for in the anchored MAIC and STC analyses. RESULTS: Analyses showed 
      statistically significant higher rates of remission and HSCT with InO compared to 
      Blina irrespective of the ITC method used or measure of the effect (i.e., odds 
      ratio [OR] or rate difference). The treatment effects derived from the MAIC and STC 
      analyses were consistent and stronger than those estimated from the NMA. A trend 
      favoring InO was detected for EFS. The ITC results for OS suggest no difference 
      between InO and Blina. CONCLUSION: Results from these ITCs indicated a statistically 
      significant advantage for InO over Blina for rates of remission and HSCT in adults 
      with relapsed or refractory B cell precursor ALL. It was not possible to fully 
      adjust for all treatment-effect modifiers, and the similarity in chemotherapy 
      regimens used in the SoC comparator arms of the INO-VATE-ALL and TOWER studies is 
      worthy of further exploration. Both studies, however, used chemotherapy regimens 
      that have a low response rate; therefore, no significant differences in efficacy 
      outcomes are expected between SoC arms. FUNDING: Pfizer Inc, New York, NY. Plain

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To perform an adjusted indirect comparison of the efficacy of 
      enzalutamide and apalutamide in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer (nmCRPC) with a high risk of progression to metastatic disease. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: After carrying out a literature search, we performed an 
      adjusted indirect comparison (Bucher et al.) of the relative efficacy of 
      enzalutamide and apalutamide in patients with nmCRPC with a high risk of progression 
      to metastatic disease. The outcomes included were metastasis-free survival (MFS) and 
      PSA response rate (PSARR). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant 
      differences between enzalutamide and apalutamide regarding the analysed outcomes. 
      For the comparison enzalutamide+ADT vs. apalutamide+ADT: MFS a HR (95% CI)=1,036 
      (0.781-1.373) was obtained. For PSARR, a RR (95% CI)=0.81 (0.339-1.938) was 
      obtained. CONCLUSIONS: The adjusted indirect comparison performed in this study 
      shows that there are no statistically significant differences in terms of efficacy 
      regarding MFS and PSARR between enzalutamide+ADT and apalutamide+ADT in patients 
      with nmCRPC with a high risk of progression to metastatic disease. However, in order 
      to confirm these results, an independent trial with direct comparison between both 
      drugs would be required.

TI  - Advanced Androgen Blockage in Nonmetastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: An 
      Indirect Comparison of Apalutamide and Enzalutamide.
PG  - 238-241
LID - S2588-9311(18)30031-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.euo.2018.04.004 [doi]
AB  - Patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) have 
      historically had few treatment options. Recently, randomized controlled trials have 
      examined the benefit of apalutamide and enzalutamide in these patients. We sought to 
      perform an indirect treatment comparison using a network meta-analysis approach to 
      compare the relative efficacy and toxicity of these two agents. The primary outcome 
      of this analysis was metastasis-free survival (MFS) while secondary outcomes were 
      time to prostate-specific antigen progression, overall survival, and adverse events. 
      The Bucher technique for indirect comparison was used to compare apalutamide and 
      enzalutamide using the common placebo comparator. We found no evidence of a 
      significant difference in MFS (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.37) 
      between enzalutamide and apalutamide. Similarly, there were no differences for any 
      of the secondary outcomes. While indirect comparisons cannot supplant direct 
      comparative data, this analysis suggests that apalutamide and enzalutamide are 
      similarly effective in delaying metastases for patients with nmCRPC. PATIENT 
      SUMMARY: Historically, there have been few treatment options for prostate cancer 
      patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy who have rising prostate-specific 
      antigen levels without obvious recurrence of cancer. Recent randomized controlled 
      trials demonstrated that treatment with enzalutamide and apalutamide delayed the 
      development of metastatic cancer. This study demonstrates through an indirect 
      comparison that both medications are likely to have similar efficacy and side-effect 
      profiles.

PG  - 851-857
LID - 10.2340/00015555-3219 [doi]
AB  - Dupilumab is approved for uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD); 
      cyclosporine is approved for severe AD for ≤ 1 year. The efficacy/effectiveness of 
      these treat-ments was compared indirectly. Regression models used pooled 
      patient-level data to estimate response (Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) 
      EASI-50/EASI-75 at weeks 12-16 and 24-30) to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (CHRONOS 
      [NCT02260986]) or cyclosporine (University Medical Center). Models were adjusted for 
      sex, baseline EASI, and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine level. A total of 
      106 patients received dupilumab (+ topical cortico-steroids; + TCS), and 57 received 
      cyclosporine (+ TCS). Among University Medical Center patients, estimated EASI-50 
      responders were, dupilumab vs. cyclosporine, 91% vs. 77% (p = 0.038; weeks 12-16), 
      and 96% vs. 67% (p < 0.0001; weeks 24-30); EASI-75 responders were 78% vs. 56% 
      (p = 0.016; weeks 12-16) and 80% vs. 47% (p <0.001; weeks 24-30). Among CHRONOS 
      patients, estimated EASI-50 responders were 90% vs. 74% (p <0.038; weeks 12-16) and 
      92% vs. 53% (p < 0.0001; weeks 24-30); EASI-75 responders were 75% vs. 52% 
      (p = 0.016; weeks 12-16) and 74% vs. 40% (p <0.001; weeks 24-30), respectively. 
      These results suggest a higher relative efficacy of dupilumab vs. cyclosporine.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to conduct a scoping review of the 
      published literature on methods used to combine randomized and nonrandomized 
      evidence (NRE) in network meta-analyses (NMAs) and their respective characteristics. 
      STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a scoping review using a list of NMAs which 
      incorporated NRE that were identified from a previous review. All NMAs that included 
      NRE in the analysis of main outcomes or sensitivity analyses were eligible for 
      inclusion. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion and performed 
      data abstraction. Data analysis involved quantitative (frequencies and percentages) 
      and qualitative (narrative synthesis) methods. RESULTS: A total of 23 NMAs met the 
      predefined inclusion criteria, of which 74% (n = 17) used naïve pooling, 0% used NRE 
      as informative priors, 9% (n = 2) used the 3-level Bayesian hierarchical model, 9% 
      (n = 2) used all methods, and 9% (n = 2) used other methods. Most NMAs were 
      supplemented with additional analyses to investigate the effect estimates when only 
      randomized evidence was included. CONCLUSION: Although most studies provided 
      justification for the inclusion of NRE, transparent reporting of the method used to 
      combine randomized evidence and NRE was unclear in most published networks. Most 
      NMAs used naïve pooling for combining randomized evidence and NRE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest gynecological diseases and the 
      annual mortality of ovarian cancer continues to rise. The prognosis of ovarian 
      cancer is poor because it is prone to early metastasis during progression. 
      Therefore, early diagnosis of ovarian cancer is very important. Some systematic 
      reviews have evaluated the diagnostic value of different biomarkers for ovarian 
      cancer. However, there is no consensus in the conclusions, and some are even 
      contradictory. This study aims to assess the methodological and reporting quality of 
      available systematic reviews and to find an optimal biomarker for diagnosing ovarian 
      cancer. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase.com, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, 
      and Web of Science were searched to identify relevant systematic reviews from 
      inception to February 2019. We included systematic reviews that include randomized 
      controlled trials, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, or cohort studies 
      as long as the systematic reviews evaluated the diagnostic performance of biomarkers 
      for ovarian cancer. The methodological quality will be assessed using assessment of 
      multiple systematic reviews-2 checklist, and the reporting quality will be assessed 
      using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis diagnostic 
      test accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) checklist. The pairwise meta-analysis and indirect 
      comparisons will be performed using STATA (13.0; Stata Corporation, College Station, 
      TX). RESULTS: The results of this overview will be submitted to a peer-reviewed 
      journal for publication. CONCLUSION: This overview will provide comprehensive 
      evidence of different biomarkers for diagnosing ovarian cancer. PROSPERO

TI  - Network meta-analysis of multicomponent interventions.
PG  - 808-821
LID - 10.1002/bimj.201800167 [doi]
AB  - In network meta-analysis (NMA), treatments can be complex interventions, for 
      example, some treatments may be combinations of others or of common components. In 
      standard NMA, all existing (single or combined) treatments are different nodes in 
      the network. However, sometimes an alternative model is of interest that utilizes 
      the information that some treatments are combinations of common components, called 
      component network meta-analysis (CNMA) model. The additive CNMA model assumes that 
      the effect of a treatment combined of two components A and B is the sum of the 
      effects of A and B, which is easily extended to treatments composed of more than two 
      components. This implies that in comparisons equal components cancel out. 
      Interaction CNMA models also allow interactions between the components. Bayesian 
      analyses have been suggested. We report an implementation of CNMA models in the 
      frequentist R package netmeta. All parameters are estimated using weighted least 
      squares regression. We illustrate the application of CNMA models using an NMA of 
      treatments for depression in primary care. Moreover, we show that these models can 
      even be applied to disconnected networks, if the composite treatments in the 
      subnetworks contain common components.

TI  - PD-(L)1 inhibitors vs. chemotherapy vs. their combination in front-line treatment 
      for NSCLC: An indirect comparison.
PG  - 3011-3021
LID - 10.1002/ijc.32366 [doi]
AB  - We comprehensively compared the therapeutic effects and safety of PD-1/L1 antibodies 
      (I), chemotherapy (C) or their combination (I + C) as first-line treatments for 
      advanced NSCLC. Online databases were searched to identify RCTs. Survival outcomes 
      and safety events were pooled by indirect treatment comparison. Main subgroup 
      analyses were conducted according to PD-L1 expression. A total of 11 RCTs involving 
      6,731 patients were included. Overall, PD-1/L1 inhibitors showed no difference to 
      chemotherapy in PFS (HR 0.90, 0.65-1.24) and OS (HR 0.84, 0.64-1.09), while I + C 
      was superior to chemotherapy both in PFS (HR 0.64, 0.58-0.71) and OS (HR 0.74, 
      0.62-0.89). I + C also showed advantages over PD-1/L1 in PFS (HR 0.71, 0.51-0.99) 
      but not OS (HR 0.88, 0.64-1.22). In the PD-L1 < 1% subgroup, I + C was beneficial 
      both in OS (HR 0.78, 0.67-0.90) and PFS (HR 0.72, 0.65-0.80) than chemotherapy. In 
      PD-L1 ≥ 50% population, PD-1/L1 had longer OS than chemotherapy (HR 0.71, 
      0.60-0.84); I + C also had longer OS (HR 0.61, 0.49-0.77) and PFS (HR 
      0.41,0.34-0.49) than chemotherapy. In indirect analysis (PD-L1 ≥ 50%), I + C was 
      superior to PD-1/L1 in terms of PFS (HR 0.54, 0.35-0.82), but not OS (HR 0.86, 
      0.65-1.14). Both treatment-related and immune-mediated adverse events occurred most 
      frequently in the combination therapy group. We suggest that a combination regimen 
      is preferable as first-line treatment for NSCLC patients with different PD-L1 
      expression, in the meanwhile, in cautious of side effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of different hormonal biomarkers and 
      to find the most effective hormonal biomarker for the diagnosis of endometriosis. 
      DATA SOURCES: We conducted a systematic search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane 
      Library, and China Biomedical Literature to identify relevant studies from the first 
      day of databases to August 2018. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Two independent 
      reviewers screened for study eligibility and extracted data. Random controlled 
      trials, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, and cohort studies evaluating 
      the diagnostic accuracy of hormonal markers for endometriosis were included. 
      TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: We included 17 studies that involved 1279 
      participants and evaluated 7 hormonal biomarkers. The pooled sensitivity and 
      specificity in endometriosis were .79 (.71, .86) and .89 (.82, .94) for aromatase, 
      .30 (.18, .46) and .80 (.65, .90) for human chorionic gonadotropin/luteinizing 
      hormone receptor, .75 (.66, .83) and .47 (.34, .60) for estrogen receptor (ER)-α, 
      .65 (.56, .74) and .68 (.55, .80) for ER-β, .45 (.38-.52) and .92 (.85-.97) for 
      serum prolactin, .69 (.51, .83) and .30 (.16, .49) for estrogen sulfotransferase, 
      and .73 (.60-.84) and .48 (.33-.63) for 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 
      (17βHSD2). Compared with human chorionic gonadotropin/luteinizing hormone receptor, 
      ER-α, ER-β, estrogen sulfotransferase, and 17βHSD2, aromatase had a higher 
      sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio. The 
      specificities of aromatase and serum prolactin were comparable, but the sensitivity, 
      positive likelihood ratio, and positive likelihood ratio of serum prolactin were 
      much lower than that of aromatase. CONCLUSION: Aromatase may be an excellent 
      diagnostic test for endometriosis. However, because of the moderate quality of the 
      included studies and the limited sample size, this result requires more research to 
      validate. (PROSPERO registration number: PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018105126.).

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparison of bosutinib, dasatinib and nilotinib effect 
      on survival and major cytogenetic response in treatment of second-line chronic phase 
      chronic myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 1615-1622
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2019.1605239 [doi]
AB  - Objective: In clinical trials of second-line therapies for chronic phase chronic 
      myeloid leukemia (CP-CML), to date, only single-arm trials have been conducted for 
      the available tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments (bosutinib, dasatinib and 
      nilotinib). These trials included heterogeneous patient populations in terms of 
      disease and baseline characteristics. These hamper the use of standard network 
      meta-analyses for indirect treatment comparison of relative efficacy. In this 
      situation, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) in second-line CP-CML was 
      performed. The aim was to compare the relative efficacies of bosutinib, dasatinib 
      and nilotinib in second-line CP-CML patients.Methods: The MAIC was preceded by a 
      systematic literature review that ensured inclusion of the underlying data for the 
      analyses. The outcomes were measured in terms of overall survival (OS), 
      progression-free survival (PFS) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR). The 
      treatments were quantitatively compared based on Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) 
      regressions, on restricted mean survival (RMST, when the proportionality assumption 
      showed evidence of violation) and on odds ratios (for response measures).Results: 
      Comparing with dasatinib, bosutinib resulted in HRs for PFS and OS of 0.63 
      (0.44-0.90, p < .05) and 0.82 (0.54-1.26, p = .37) respectively, and resulted in an 
      OR for MCyR of 0.78 (0.53-1.16). Although the proportionality of hazards assumption 
      was violated for PFS, the RMST analyses confirmed the findings of the Cox 
      regression. When compared with nilotinib, bosutinib showed a significant HR of 0.54 
      (0.38-0.76, p < .01) in favor of bosutinib for PFS, a non-significant HR of 0.72 
      (0.46-1.13, p = .16) for OS and a non-significant OR of 0.98 (0.71-1.35) for 
      MCyR.Conclusions: Bosutinib had a significantly greater PFS than both dasatinib and 
      nilotinib. For OS, the findings were numerically in favor of bosutinib, but not 
      statistically significant. For MCyR, the findings were numerically in favor of 
      dasatinib and nilotinib, but not statistically significant.

TI  - Indirect Comparison of Ropinirole and Pramipexole as Levodopa Adjunctive Therapy in 
      Advanced Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1252-1265
LID - 10.1007/s12325-019-00938-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of ropinirole and 
      pramipexole as adjunctive therapies to levodopa (L-dopa) for the management of 
      advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), via a systematic review and network 
      meta-analysis. METHODS: Twenty-one double-blind randomised controlled trials of 
      patients with advanced PD with motor fluctuations receiving L-dopa comparing 
      ropinirole or pramipexole with comparators were identified from 2550 publications. 
      Bayesian indirect comparison methods were applied to independently review efficacy 
      outcomes including off-time reduction, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating 
      Scale-Activity of Daily Living (UPDRS-ADL) and UPDRS-motor scores, and safety 
      outcomes including adverse events (AE) and patient withdrawals, to determine 
      indirect treatment comparison mean differences (MD) or hazard ratios (HR) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The indirect efficacy comparison resulted in a 
      statistically nonsignificant off-time reduction difference (hours) of 
      ropinirole-sustained release (SR) versus pramipexole-immediate release (MD - 0.25; 
      95% CI - 0.71, 0.21) and ropinirole-SR versus pramipexole-extended release (ER) (MD 
      0.18; 95% CI - 0.40, 0.76). Ropinirole-SR adjunctive treatment showed a tendency 
      towards more improvement in UPDRS-ADL score (MD 1.24; 95% CI 0.23, 2.24) than 
      adjunctive treatment of pramipexole-ER. Pramipexole-ER may be less likely to induce 
      somnolence as an AE compared with ropinirole-SR (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23, 0.89). 
      However, there were no statistically significant differences in UPDRS-motor score 
      reduction, incidence of dyskinesia, hallucination, hypotension, insomnia and nausea, 
      or withdrawals due to AE, for any reason. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive therapy with 
      ropinirole-SR or pramipexole appears to offer similar efficacy and tolerability in 
      patients with advanced PD on the basis of this indirect comparison. FUNDING: GSK.

BTI - Evidence reviews for respiratory support: Specialist neonatal respiratory care for 
      babies born preterm: Evidence review B
AB  - The type of care a preterm baby receives within the first few hours of life can have 
      a significant impact on their long-term outcome. The phrase “golden hour,” first 
      used in trauma patients, has been adopted to refer to neonatal care at this crucial 
      time. Early delivery room respiratory support in preterm infants has been 
      extensively investigated and may make a significant contribution to reducing the 
      risk of long-term lung damage, other morbidities and even death. One of the 
      difficult choices in the current era is to determine whether or not to intubate a 
      preterm baby in order to give surfactant very soon after birth. Many babies can be 
      supported by non-invasive methods of delivering oxygen, such as continuous positive 
      airways pressure (CPAP), which avoid intubation. There is evidence that surfactant 
      can be administered to these non-intubated babies using less invasive administration 
      techniques that may reduce the risk of morbidity associated with intubation. At 
      present it is not clear which is the best strategy. This review aims to explore 
      which delivery room respiratory support techniques are likely to give optimal 
      disease-free survival in preterm infants. We have compared early invasive intubation 
      and surfactant administration techniques, with less invasive surfactant 
      administration techniques and non-invasive respiratory support techniques. 
      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm babies is caused by a deficiency of 
      lung surfactant. The risk of RDS increases with decreasing gestational age, and is 
      almost inevitable in babies born at less than 28 weeks gestation. Without surfactant 
      the lungs become stiff and the alveoli collapse at end-expiration, and untreated RDS 
      is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Surfactant is a 
      naturally produced surface-active lipoprotein complex mixed with proteins, which 
      reduces the surface tension at the alveolar liquid surface. Surfactant allows 
      alveoli to stay open in expiration and substantially reduces the work of breathing. 
      It also reduces shearing forces on immature alveolar membrane, preventing membrane 
      rupture and protein leak into the alveolar space with resulting lung damage. RDS in 
      preterm babies can be prevented by administration of exogenous animal derived 
      surfactant therapy, and this substantially reduces mortality and respiratory 
      morbidity for this population, including improved survival without bronchopulmonary 
      dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days. However, the optimal dose (including the use of single 
      or multiple administration) and mode of administration of surfactant remains 
      controversial and may make a significant contribution to the chances of long term 
      lung damage, other morbidities or death. The various techniques of administration 
      can be grouped into three categories: conventional endotracheal intubation (where 
      the baby is intubated, surfactant is administered and the baby then continues on 
      mechanical ventilation); endotracheal intubation and surfactant administration 
      followed by immediate extubation (also called Intubate, Surfactant, Rapid 
      Extubation, and known as InSuRE or ISX); surfactant administration without 
      endotracheal intubation via a thin endotracheal catheter during spontaneous 
      breathing or with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) (known as Minimally 
      Invasive Surfactant Therapy, MIST or Less Invasive Surfactant Administration, LISA, 
      or Avoidance of Mechanical Ventilation, AMV). This review aims to explore which 
      administration technique and dosing regimen is likely to give optimal outcomes in 
      preterm infants. Low flow oxygen is frequently used in neonatal units, as an 
      integral part of respiratory support in preterm babies. The goal of oxygen therapy 
      is to achieve adequate delivery of oxygen to the tissues without causing oxygen 
      toxicity. In addition to delivering oxygen via a ventilator or CPAP circuit, there 
      are several different methods of low-flow oxygen administration: head box oxygen, 
      incubator, facemask, nasal prongs, nasal cannula and nasopharyngeal catheter. Oxygen 
      can be delivered humidified or non-humidified, and the method of titration can be 
      automated or manual. It is important to know, the efficacy, potential risks, and the 
      impact on lung function of the different methods when used in preterm babies. The 
      aim of this review is to determine the optimal type of oxygen delivered, method of 
      administration and method of titration in preterm babies requiring respiratory 
      support. The lungs of preterm babies are structurally immature, deficient of 
      surfactant and not supported by a rigid chest wall. They are therefore highly 
      susceptible to injury from the different types of respiratory support available for 
      use in this population. Whereas pressure support ventilation (PSV) and continuous 
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) have been used in neonatology for many years, newer 
      modes of ventilation such as volume targeted ventilation (VTV) and, more recently, 
      heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) have become popular. This review 
      will look at the evidence available to assess the effectiveness of the different 
      types of assisted ventilation techniques in preterm babies. Inhaled nitric oxide is 
      a potent, selective pulmonary vasodilator. It has a clearly defined role in the 
      management of pulmonary hypertension in term babies, where it has been shown to 
      improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 
      However, its role in preterm babies requiring invasive respiratory support is less 
      well defined. Recently, a number of studies have been published looking at the 
      effect of inhaled nitric oxide on the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) 
      in preterm babies and its potential role in hypoxic respiratory failure. This review 
      aims to determine the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide in preterm babies 
      requiring invasive ventilation, both in hypoxic respiratory failure and in the 
      prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia In the NMA for the outcome of mortality 
      prior to discharge and BPD at 36 weeks PMA there was no evidence to suggest a 
      difference between between CPAP, NIPPV, BiPAP/SiPAP, or Hi Flow. Similarly, pairwise 
      analyses did not identify any meaningful differences between non-invasive 
      ventilation techniques. The committee acknowledged two existing non-UK economic 
      evaluations comparing CPAP with NIPPV and Hi Flow, respectively. However, these 
      analyses did not include all non-invasive ventilation techniques of interest. Given 
      the lack of differences in the clinical effectiveness between non-invasive 
      ventilation techniques and the lack of existing economic evidence the committee 
      considered it important to compare the costs of the techniques to aid considerations 
      of cost effectiveness. Generally the NHS Reference Costs (DHSC, 2018) is the 
      recommended source of unit cost data that should be used to aid considerations of 
      cost effectiveness. However, the committee explained that the neonatal activity 
      payments are based on the level of activity (that is, intensive care, high 
      dependency and special care) rather than procedures. As a result, costings of 
      non-invasive ventilation techniques were undertaken to aid considerations of cost 
      effectiveness and included equipment acquisition costs, maintenanece costs and 
      consumable costs. The results of conventional pairwise meta-analyses of direct 
      evidence alone do not help to fully inform which invasive and non-invasive 
      ventilation technique is most effective in preterm babies requiring respiratory 
      support. Each pairwise comparison does not fully inform the choice between the 
      different treatments and having a series of discrete pairwise comparisons can be 
      incoherent and difficult to interpret. In addition, direct comparisons of treatments 
      of clinical interest are not fully available, for all comparisons. To overcome these 
      issues, a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed. Advantages of 
      performing this type of analysis are as follows. It allows the synthesis of evidence 
      on multiple treatments compared directly and indirectly without breaking 
      randomisation. If treatment A has never been compared to treatment B in a head to 
      head trial, but these two interventions have been compared to a common comparator, 
      then an indirect treatment comparison can be derived using the relative effects of 
      the two treatments versus the common comparator. Indirect estimates can be 
      calculated whenever there is a path linking two treatments through a set of common 
      comparators. All the randomised evidence is considered simultaneously within the 
      same model. For every intervention in a connected network, a relative effect 
      estimate (with its 95% credible intervals, CrIs) between any two interventions can 
      be estimated. These estimates provide a useful clinical summary of the results and 
      facilitate the formation of recommendations based on all relevant evidence, whilst 
      appropriately accounting for uncertainty. Ranks of interventions may also be 
      calculated. Estimates from the NMA can be used to directly parameterise treatment 
      effectiveness in cost-effectiveness modelling of multiple treatments. Conventional 
      fixed effect meta-analysis assumes that the relative effect of one treatment 
      compared to another is the same across an entire set of trials. In a random effects 
      model, it is assumed that the relative effects are different in each trial but that 
      they are from a single common distribution and that this distribution is common 
      across all sets of trials. NMA requires an additional assumption over conventional 
      meta-analysis. The additional assumption is that intervention A has the same effect 
      on people in trials of intervention A compared to intervention B as it does for 
      people in trials of intervention A versus intervention C and so on. Thus, in an NMA, 
      the assumption is that intervention A has the same effect across trials of A versus 
      B, A versus C and so on. The terms indirect treatment comparisons, mixed treatment 
      comparisons and NMA are used interchangeably. We use the term NMA as the network 
      consists of both indirect treatment comparisons (some trials have a common 
      comparator and some do not) and mixed treatment comparisons (with at least one 
      closed loop, combination of direct and indirect evidence). The purpose of this 
      analysis was to assess the consistency assumption in the network meta-analysis (NMA) 
      model used to estimate the comparative effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation 
      techniques in specialist neonatal respiratory care (SNRC) for babies born preterm. 
      The outcomes included in this analysis were 1) mortality prior to discharge and 2) 
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). The purpose of 
      this analysis was to assess the consistency assumption in the network meta-analysis 
      (NMA) model used to estimate the comparative effectiveness of specialist neonatal 
      respiratory care (SNRC) interventions for babies born preterm. The outcomes included 
      in this analysis were 1) mortality prior to discharge and 2) Bronchopulmonary 
      Dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks PMA.

AB  - Several systematic reviews have investigated the accuracy of imaging modalities for 
      lymph node involvement of rectal cancer, but there are considerable differences in 
      conclusions. This overview aimed to assess the methodological and reporting quality 
      of systematic reviews that evaluated the diagnostic value of imaging modalities for 
      lymph node involvement in patients with rectal cancer and to compare the diagnostic 
      value of different modalities for lymph node involvement. The PubMed, EMBASE, 
      Cochrane Library and Chinese Biomedicine Literature were searched to identify 
      relevant systematic reviews. The methodological quality was assessed using the 
      AMSTAR checklist, and the reporting quality was assessed using PRISMA-DTA checklist. 
      The indirect comparison was conducted to compare the accuracy of different imaging 
      modalities. Seven systematic reviews involving 353 primary studies were included. 
      The median (Range) AMSTAR scores were 6.0 (4.0-9.0); the median (Range) PRISMA-DTA 
      scores were 18.0 (11.0-23.0). Sensitivity of MRI [0.69 (95% CI 0.63, 0.77)] was 
      significantly higher than that of ERUS [0.57 (95% CI 0.53, 0.62)]. Specificity of 
      ERUS [0.80 (95% CI 0.77, 0.83)] was significantly higher than that of CT [0.72 (95% 
      CI 0.67, 0.78)]. Positive likelihood ratio of EUS [3.04 (95% CI 2.75, 3.36)] was 
      significantly higher than that of CT [2.21 (95% CI 1.69, 2.90)]. EUS had better 
      diagnostic value than CT and ERUS in the diagnosis of lymph node involvement. 
      Compared with CT and ERUS, MRI was more sensitive. EUS and MRI had comparable 
      diagnostic accuracy, but no modality was proved to be particularly accurate.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: For prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks, replacement 
      therapy with human C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) treatment is approved and available as 
      intravenous [C1-INH(IV)] (Cinryze(®)) and subcutaneous [C1-INH(SC)] HAEGARDA(®) 
      preparations. In the absence of a head-to-head comparative study of the two 
      treatment modalities, an indirect comparison of data from 2 independent but similar 
      clinical trials was undertaken. METHODS: Two similar randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, crossover studies were identified which evaluated either 
      C1-INH(SC) (COMPACT; NCT01912456; 16 weeks) or C1-INH(IV) (CHANGE; NCT01005888; 
      14 weeks) vs. placebo (on-demand treatment only) for routine prevention of HAE 
      attacks. Individual patient data from each trial were used to conduct an indirect 
      comparison of treatment effects. Attack reductions (absolute and percent of 
      mean/median number of monthly HAE attacks reduction over placebo) were compared 
      between the two C1-INH formulations at approved/recommended doses: C1-INH(SC) 
      60 IU/kg twice weekly (n = 45) and 1000 U of C1-INH(IV) twice weekly (n = 22). Point 
      estimates were adjusted using mixed and quantile regression models that controlled 
      for study design. RESULTS: The absolute mean monthly numbers of HAE attack 
      reductions were 3.6 (95% CI 2.9, 4.2) for C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg vs. placebo and 2.3 
      (1.4, 3.3) for C1-INH(IV) vs. placebo; between-product difference, 1.3 (0.1, 2.4; 
      P = 0.034). The mean percent reduction in monthly attack rate was significantly 
      greater with C1-INH(SC) as compared with C1-INH(IV) (84% vs. 51%; P < 0.001). The 
      percentages of subjects experiencing ≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, and ≥ 90% reductions in monthly 
      HAE attack rates versus placebo were significantly higher with C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg 
      as compared to C1-INH(IV) 1000 U (≥ 50% reduction: 91% vs. 50%, odds ratio 
      [OR] = 10.33, P = 0.003; ≥ 70% reduction: 84% vs. 46%, OR = 6.19, P = 0.005; ≥ 90% 
      reduction: 57% vs. 18%, OR = 6.04, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of 
      an indirect study comparison, this analysis suggests greater attack reduction with 
      twice-weekly C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg as compared to twice-weekly C1-INH(IV) 1000 U for 
      the routine prevention of HAE attacks.

TI  - Survival, Motor Function, and Motor Milestones: Comparison of AVXS-101 Relative to 
      Nusinersen for the Treatment of Infants with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1.
PG  - 1164-1176
LID - 10.1007/s12325-019-00923-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 typically face a 
      decline in motor function and a severely shortened life expectancy. Clinical trials 
      for SMA type 1 therapies, onasemnogene abeparvovec (AVXS-101) and nusinersen, 
      demonstrated meaningful improvements in efficacy (e.g., overall survival) but there 
      were no head-to-head clinical trials assessing comparative efficacy. This study 
      estimated the treatment effects of AVXS-101 relative to nusinersen for the treatment 
      of SMA type 1. METHODS: Overall survival, event-free survival (no death or need to 
      use permanent assisted ventilation), improvement in motor function [increase of ≥ 4 
      points in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders 
      (CHOP-INTEND) score from baseline], and motor milestone achievements (head control, 
      rolling over, and sitting unassisted) reported in the onasemnogene abeparvovec 
      (AVXS-101-CL-101; NCT02122952) and nusinersen (ENDEAR; NCT02193074) clinical trials 
      were indirectly compared using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. RESULTS: Among 
      symptomatic infants with SMA type 1, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one 
      more death with AVXS-101 instead of nusinersen was 6.2 [95% confidence intervals 
      (CI) = 4.1-12.2], and the probability of preventing death was 20% higher for 
      patients treated with AVXS-101 than nusinersen [risk ratio (RR) = 1.2, 95% 
      CI 1.1-1.3]. For event-free survival, the NNT to prevent one more event was 2.6 (95% 
      CI 2.0-3.6) and RR was 1.6 (95% CI 1.4-1.9). For improvement in motor function, NNT 
      was 3.5 (95% CI 2.6-5.3) and RR was 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.6). For milestone 
      achievements, the NNTs were 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.9), 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.5), and 1.2 (95% 
      CI 1.0-1.5); RRs 4.2 (95% CI 2.6-6.7), 7.8 (95% CI 3.6-17.0), and 11.2 (95% 
      CI 5.1-24.5) for head control, rolling over, and sitting unassisted, respectively. 
      Results were similar using the Bayesian approach. CONCLUSION: This indirect 
      comparison (AVXS-101-CL-101 vs. ENDEAR) among symptomatic SMA type 1 infants 
      suggests that AVXS-101 may have an efficacy advantage relative to nusinersen for 
      overall survival, independence from permanent assisted ventilation, motor function, 
      and motor milestones. FUNDING: AveXis.

TI  - Indirect Treatment Comparison of the Efficacy and Safety of Sarilumab Monotherapy in 
      Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients with Inadequate Response to Conventional 
      Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs.
PG  - 817-827
LID - 10.1007/s12325-019-00912-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of subcutaneous 
      sarilumab 200 mg monotherapy administered every 2 weeks (q2w) versus other 
      monotherapies of biologic, targeted and conventional synthetic disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs, tsDMARDs, csDMARDs) at recommended doses for treatment 
      of rheumatoid arthritis in patients who are intolerant of or inadequate responders 
      to csDMARDs (csDMARD-IR). METHODS: A systematic literature review and network 
      meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted on 24-week efficacy outcomes: Health Assessment 
      Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score, American College of Rheumatology 
      (ACR) 20/50/70 criteria, and European League Against Rheumatism Disease Activity 
      Score 28-joint count erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28) < 2.6. In addition, 
      serious infections and serious adverse events (SI/SAE) were examined at 24 weeks. 
      RESULTS: Nine trials were selected for the NMA. Sarilumab 200 mg showed superiority 
      versus adalimumab monotherapy on all efficacy outcomes and versus tofacitinib 
      monotherapy on ACR20. Compared with csDMARDs, sarilumab 200 mg showed superiority on 
      ACR 20/50/70 criteria and DAS28 < 2.6 but had similar efficacy on HAQ-DI. Efficacy 
      of sarilumab 200 mg was similar versus certolizumab, etanercept, tofacitinib and 
      tocilizumab 8 mg/kg monotherapy across all efficacy outcomes. SI/SAE appeared 
      similar for sarilumab 200 mg versus all comparators. CONCLUSION: In csDMARD-IR 
      patients, sarilumab 200 mg monotherapy has superior efficacy and similar safety 
      versus csDMARDs, superior efficacy and similar safety versus adalimumab, and similar 
      efficacy and safety versus bDMARDs and tsDMARDs. FUNDING: Sanofi and Regeneron

      between nivolumab + ipilimumab (CheckMate 067/069 studies) and BRAF + MEK inhibitors 
      (COMBI-d, COMBI-v and coBRIM studies). Overall survival (OS), progression-free 
      survival and objective response rates were assessed. RESULTS: After adjusting, 
      nivolumab + ipilimumab showed improved OS versus dabrafenib + trametinib (hazard 
      ratio [HR] = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.46-0.89) or vemurafenib + cobimetinib (HR = 0.56; 95% 
      CI: 0.36-0.89); OS outcomes were similar at 1 year, with benefits emerging after 12 
      months; progression-free survival and objective response rates were similar. Grade 
      3/4 adverse events occurred in 54.1% with nivolumab + ipilimumab, 31.6% with 
      dabrafenib + trametinib and 59.5% with vemurafenib + cobimetinib. CONCLUSION: 
      Nivolumab + ipilimumab had significantly improved clinical outcomes versus 
      BRAF + MEK inhibitors, with benefits increasing after longer follow-up. Ongoing 
      randomized trials directly comparing these treatments are necessary to prospectively 
      validate these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of clinical trials providing direct efficacy results, 
      this study compares different methods of indirect treatment comparison (ITC), and 
      their respective impacts on efficacy estimates for lenvatinib (LEN) plus everolimus 
      (EVE) combination therapy compared to other second-line treatments for 
      advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (a/mRCC). METHODS: Using EVE alone as the 
      common comparator, the Bucher method for ITC compared LEN + EVE with cabozantinib 
      (CAB), nivolumab (NIV), placebo (PBO) and axitinib (AXI). Hazard ratios (HR) for 
      overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) estimated the impact of 
      applying three versions of the LEN+EVE trial data in separate ITCs. Last, to 
      overcome exchangeability bias and potential violations to the proportional hazards 
      assumption, a network meta-analysis using fractional polynomials was performed. 
      RESULTS: Bucher ITCs demonstrated LEN + EVE superiority over EVE for PFS, indirect 
      superiority to NIV, AXI, and PBO, and no difference to CAB. For OS, LEN + EVE was 
      superior to EVE and indirectly superior to PBO, applying original HOPE 205 data. 
      Using European Medicines Agency data, LEN + EVE was directly superior to EVE for OS. 
      Fractional polynomial HRs for PFS and OS substantially overlapped with Bucher 
      estimates, demonstrating LEN+EVE superiority over EVE, alone, NIV, and CAB. However, 
      there were no statistically significant results as the credible intervals for HR 
      crossed 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing three Bucher ITCs, LEN + EVE demonstrated 
      superior PFS when indirectly compared to NIV, AXI, and PBO, and mixed results for 
      OS. While fractional polynomial modelling for PFS and OS failed to find 
      statistically significant differences in LEN + EVE efficacy, the overall HR trends 
      were comparable.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparison: secukinumab versus infliximab in 
      biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis.
PG  - 497-510

AB  - Aim: To compare secukinumab with infliximab in biologic-naive patients with 
      psoriatic arthritis using matching-adjusted indirect comparison. Patients & methods: 
      Individual patient baseline data for secukinumab were matched to published aggregate 
      data for infliximab by key baseline characteristics, with matching weights 
      determined by logistic regression, and used to recalculate American College of 
      Rheumatology (ACR) responses for secukinumab, for comparison with infliximab. 
      Results: There were no differences in outcomes between secukinumab and infliximab at 
      weeks 6/8 and 14/16. At weeks 24 and 54/52, ACR 20 responses were higher with 
      secukinumab 150 mg than infliximab. At week 54/52, ACR 20/50 responses were higher 
      for secukinumab 300 mg than infliximab. Conclusion: In the mid to long term, 
      patients receiving secukinumab were more likely to achieve ACR 20/50 responses than 
      those receiving infliximab.

TI  - Estimating the comparative efficacy of cladribine tablets versus alternative disease 
      modifying treatments in active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: adjusting for 
      patient characteristics using meta-regression and matching-adjusted indirect 
      treatment comparison approaches.
PG  - 1371-1378
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2019.1585779 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To estimate the comparative efficacy of cladribine tablets versus 
      alternative disease modifying therapies (DMTs) - fingolimod, natalizumab, 
      alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab - in adults with active relapsing-remitting multiple 
      sclerosis (RRMS), using meta-regression to provide subpopulation-specific estimates 
      of drug effect. Additionally, to determine the feasibility of conducting a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to validate the meta-regression 
      results. Methods: A published systematic literature review (SLR) identified studies 
      evaluating the efficacy of cladribine tablets and alternative DMTs in the management 
      of active RRMS. A series of meta-regression models were run with adjustment for 
      baseline risk, fitted to data from the intention-to-treat cohorts of trials 
      identified in the SLR. A non-parametric MAIC analysis adjusted for differences 
      between studies by reweighting patient-level data from the index trial to match the 
      mean baseline characteristics reported for trials with only aggregate data. Results: 
      The meta-regression analysis showed significant overlap in credible intervals for 
      the hazard ratios of 6 month confirmed disability progression (CDP-6M) and 
      annualized relapse rate (ARR), with no therapy statistically dominating in terms of 
      efficacy and all therapies estimated to reduce the ARR compared to placebo in all 
      subpopulations. In the MAIC analysis, cladribine tablets showed a reduction in 
      CDP-6M and ARR comparable to alemtuzumab before and after matching. Conclusion: This 
      analysis has demonstrated that cladribine tablets have comparable relative efficacy 
      to other highly efficacious DMTs in active RRMS across all subpopulations, thus 
      validating the comparative effectiveness results from previous network 
      meta-analysis. The MAIC analysis showed that cladribine tablets are comparable in 
      efficacy to alemtuzumab in the treatment of patients with RRMS.

TI  - Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Blinatumomab vs. Inotuzumab Ozogamicin for 
      Adults with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
PG  - 950-961
LID - 10.1007/s12325-019-0873-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the absence of head-to-head trials, this analysis aimed to provide 
      a fair indirect comparison of the efficacy between blinatumomab and inotuzumab 
      ozogamicin (InO), two treatments for adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R ALL) who received no more than one prior salvage 
      therapy, by adjusting for cross-trial differences. METHODS: Patient-level data from 
      the Phase 3 blinatumomab trial TOWER and published aggregated data from the Phase 3 
      InO trial INO-VATE-ALL were used to conduct matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. 
      Patients with 2+ prior salvage therapies from TOWER were excluded because such 
      patients were not included in INO-VATE-ALL. To ensure balance in the remaining 
      patients, baseline characteristics for the TOWER patients were weighted to match the 
      average baseline characteristics in INO-VATE-ALL, including sex, age, race, 
      performance status, bone marrow blast, previous salvage therapy, previous allogeneic 
      transplantation, complete remission with complete hematologic recovery (CR) to most 
      recent induction therapy, and duration of first remission. Overall survival (OS), 
      including median and restricted mean survival time (RMST) at 12 and 20.7 months, and 
      CR were estimated and compared. RESULTS: A total of 310 patients in TOWER were 
      included (blinatumomab, n = 203; standard of care chemotherapy, n = 107). After 
      matching the listed baseline characteristics, the median OS was 9.3 months for 
      blinatumomab and 7.7 months for InO (weighted log-rank test p = 0.4). The relative 
      RMST at 12 months was 1.6 months longer for blinatumomab than for InO [95% CI (0.1, 
      3.2); p = 0.04]; at 20.7 months the RMST was not significantly different. The CR 
      rates were similar [anchor-based difference = - 2.8%, 95% CI (- 17.5%, 11.9%); 
      p = 0.71]. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for cross-trial differences, blinatumomab 
      demonstrated a similar CR rate and potential OS benefit versus InO among adult 
      patients with R/R ALL who received no more than one prior salvage therapy. Further 
      studies are suggested to confirm this finding. FUNDING: Amgen.

TI  - Economic evaluation of sunitinib versus pazopanib and best supportive care for the 
      treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Chile: cost-effectiveness analysis 
      and a mixed treatment comparison.
PG  - 609-617
LID - 10.1080/14737167.2019.1580572 [doi]
AB  - Background: Sunitinib and Pazopanib are two metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) 
      treatment alternatives, however the health system in Chile does not consider 
      coverage for any. The cost-effectiveness versus relevant comparator was assessed to 
      support evidence-based decision making. Methods: A four health states Markov model 
      was built: first, second line treatments, BSC and death. Benefits were measured in 
      QALYs, and efficacy estimates were obtained from an indirect treatment comparison. A 
      10-year time horizon and a 3% undifferentiated discount rate were considered. 
      Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The 
      costs of treating MRCC with Sunitinib were higher than Pazopanib and BSC. When 
      comparing Sunitinib versus Pazopanib, the incremental benefit is small favoring 
      Sunitinib (0.03 QALYs). The base case scenario shows an average ICER of PA versus 
      BSC of US$62,327.11/QALY and of US$85,885/QALY for Sunitinib versus Pazopanib. The 
      ICER was most sensitive to the OS relative to BSC, where evidence was associated to 
      important bias. Conclusions: Sunitinib or Pazopanib can be considered cost-effective 
      if a 3 GDP per-capita threshold is assumed. The decision between SU or PA is highly 
      sensitive to the price of the drugs, rather than the outcomes. Therefore, the 
      decision might be made based on cost-minimization exercise.

TI  - Indirect comparison of vedolizumab and adalimumab for biologic-naive patients with 
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 178-187
LID - 10.1080/00365521.2019.1569124 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Indirect comparison of efficacy and safety of vedolizumab with adalimumab in 
      biologic-naïve patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: 
      Vedolizumab is a gut-selective medication for moderate to severe UC. Since no 
      comparative trials are available for direct comparison of vedolizumab vs adalimumab 
      in UC, a systematic review of literature databases was conducted to identify 
      randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the two drugs in patients with moderate to 
      severe UC after failure of conventional treatment. Studies were screened for 
      eligibility by two reviewers based on predefined inclusion criteria. Bucher's 
      adjusted indirect comparison was used to compare vedolizumab and adalimumab 
      indirectly through placebo as common comparator. RESULTS: One vedolizumab study 
      (GEMINI 1) and three adalimumab studies (ULTRA 1, ULTRA 2 and M10-447) met the 
      eligibility criteria. Baseline characteristics of the included populations were 
      similar in biologic-naïve UC patients across study arms. Although no statistically 
      significant differences between treatments were found for induction efficacy 
      endpoints, there was a trend toward a benefit of vedolizumab over adalimumab. There 
      were also no significant differences between treatments for any maintenance efficacy 
      endpoints, with no clear trend favoring either agent. Vedolizumab exhibited 
      statistically superior maintenance safety compared with adalimumab, with significant 
      reductions in risks of adverse events (relative risk 0.67 [95% confidence interval 
      0.57-0.80]; p < .0001), serious adverse events (0.20 [0.09-0.42]; p < .0001) and 
      adverse events leading to discontinuation (0.14 [0.05-0.43]; p = .0006). CONCLUSION: 
      This analysis indicates that vedolizumab has comparable efficacy to adalimumab with 
      improved safety in biologic-naïve patients with moderate to severe UC.

TI  - Treatment sequence network meta-analysis in Crohn's disease: a methodological case 
      study.
PG  - 733-756
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2019.1580094 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several biologic therapies are available for the treatment of 
      mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease (CD). This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to 
      assess the comparative efficacy of ustekinumab, adalimumab, vedolizumab and 
      infliximab in the maintenance of clinical response and remission after 1 year of 
      treatment. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify 
      relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Key outcomes of interest were clinical 
      response (CD activity index [CDAI] reduction of 100 points; CDAI-100) and remission 
      (CDAI score under 150 points; CDAI < 150). A treatment sequence Bayesian NMA was 
      conducted to account for the re-randomization of patients based on different 
      clinical definitions, the lack of similarity of the common comparator for each trial 
      and the full treatment pathway from the induction phase onwards. RESULTS: Thirteen 
      RCTs were identified. Ustekinumab 90 mg q8w was associated with statistically 
      significant improvement in clinical response relative to placebo and vedolizumab 
      300 mg. For clinical remission, ustekinumab 90 mg q8w was associated with 
      statistically significant improvement relative to placebo and vedolizumab 300 mg 
      q8w. Findings from sub-population analyses had similar results but were not 
      statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The NMA suggest that ustekinumab is 
      associated with the highest likelihood of reaching response or remission at 1 year 
      compared with placebo, adalimumab and vedolizumab. Results should be interpreted 
      with caution because this is a novel methodology; however, the treatment sequence 
      analysis may be the most methodologically sound analysis to derive estimates of 
      comparative efficacy in CD in the absence of head-to-head evidence.

TI  - Treating Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Uncontrolled on Basal Insulin in the 
      Czech Republic: Cost-Effectiveness of IDegLira Versus iGlarLixi.
PG  - 493-508
LID - 10.1007/s13300-019-0569-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Few patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) achieve recommended 
      glycemic control targets in the Czech Republic. Novel therapies, such as fixed-ratio 
      combinations of basal insulin plus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, may 
      contribute to better glycemic control. In the analysis presented here, the present 
      analysis assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness of two fixed-ratio combinations, 
      IDegLira (insulin degludec/liraglutide) and iGlarLixi (insulin 
      glargine/lixisenatide), for the treatment of patients with T2DM inadequately 
      controlled with basal insulin from a healthcare payer perspective in the Czech 
      Republic. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed over patient 
      lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Treatment effects were obtained from 
      an indirect treatment comparison as no head-to-head data for IDegLira versus 
      iGlarLixi are currently available. IDegLira was compared with two iGlarLixi pens 
      (100 U/mL insulin glargine + 33 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL of lixisenatide, respectively). 
      Direct medical costs associated with pharmaceutical interventions, screening and 
      diabetes-related complications were captured. Deterministic and probabilistic 
      sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with gains in 
      life expectancy of 0.11 years and in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.14 
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) versus iGlarLixi, due to a lower cumulative 
      incidence and delayed onset of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was also 
      associated with higher projected costs due to higher acquisition costs; however, 
      these were partially offset by cost savings from avoided complications. IDegLira was 
      associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Czech Koruna (CZK) 695,998 
      and CZK 348,323 per QALY gained versus iGlarLixi pens containing 33 and 50 μg/mL of 
      lixisenatide, respectively. These ratios were below the commonly used 
      willingness-to-pay threshold of CZK 1,200,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: The 
      present analysis indicated that IDegLira was associated with clinical benefits 
      relative to iGlarLixi over patient lifetimes and was likely to be cost-effective in 
      the treatment of patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin in the Czech 
      Republic. FUNDING: Novo Nordisk. Plain language summary is available for this

      Combination (Segluromet): Merck Canada Inc: Indication: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that is characterized by persistent 
      elevations in blood glucose (hyperglycemia). This persistent elevated blood glucose 
      causes damage to blood vessels on a microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, and 
      neuropathy) and macrovascular (peripheral artery disease, cardiovascular disease) 
      level. Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases in Canada. Diabetes 
      Canada estimated there were 3.4 million people (9.3% of the population) with 
      diabetes in 2015 and, by 2025, this number will increase to five million people 
      (12.1%). The objective was to perform a systematic review of the beneficial and 
      harmful effects of ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg tablets in combination with 
      metformin, or metformin and sitagliptin, to improve glycemic control in adult 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when these therapies, along with diet and 
      exercise, do not provide adequate glycemic control. This review was conducted in 
      tandem with the evaluation of ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg tablets (Steglatro), 
      which includes additional study data and an appraisal of the manufacturer-submitted 
      indirect treatment comparison that are not included in this report.

TI  - Creating historical controls using data from a previous line of treatment - Two 
      non-standard approaches.

AB  - Where medical interventions are licensed based on only uncontrolled study data (for 
      example a single-arm trial), a common approach for estimating the incremental 
      benefit is to compare the treatment to a 'historical control'; data collected from 
      patients who did not receive the intervention. We illustrate with motivating 
      examples two methods for the creation of historical controls where disease 
      progression and overall survival are typically the key clinically meaningful 
      endpoints. The first method utilises information routinely collected in a clinical 
      trial programme: patients' time to disease progression on their previous line of 
      treatment against which outcomes can be compared. The second uses published clinical 
      outcomes for the prior line of treatment which can be extrapolated to estimate 
      outcomes at the next line. As examples we use two pharmaceuticals licensed on the 
      basis of uncontrolled clinical studies - idelalisib for double-refractory follicular 
      lymphoma and ofatumumab for double-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Although 
      subject to limitations that should be considered on a case-by-case basis, the 
      methods may be appropriate when trying to quantify the clinical benefit of treatment 
      based on limited and uncontrolled trial data. As a result, the methods can be used 
      to inform health technology adoption decisions.

TI  - A systematic literature review and indirect comparison of iron isomaltoside and 
      ferric carboxymaltose in iron deficiency anemia after failure or intolerance of oral 
      iron treatment.
PG  - 129-136
LID - 10.1080/17474086.2019.1575202 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The efficacy of oral iron in treating iron deficiency anemia (IDA) can 
      be limited by poor gastrointestinal (GI) absorption and adverse GI symptoms; 
      intravenous (IV) iron is a well-established alternative. The present study compared 
      the efficacy of two IV iron formulations in patients with IDA: iron isomaltoside 
      (IIM) and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). METHODS: A systematic literature review (SLR) 
      was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IIM and FCM in 
      patients with IDA. An adjusted indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of IIM and FCM 
      was then conducted to evaluate differences in change from baseline hemoglobin and 
      the proportion of patients achieving a clinically-relevant response. RESULTS: The 
      SLR identified no completed RCTs of IIM versus FCM, 5 RCTs of IIM (4 versus oral 
      iron and 1 versus iron sucrose), and 14 RCTs of FCM (11 versus oral iron and 3 
      versus iron sucrose). In an ITC via iron sucrose, IIM resulted in a significantly 
      larger increase from baseline hemoglobin with a mean difference of +0.249 g/dL with 
      IIM relative to FCM, but there was no significant difference in the proportion of 
      patients with a clinically-relevant response. CONCLUSIONS: IIM resulted in a larger 
      increase from baseline hemoglobin than FCM in patients with IDA, but with no 
      difference in the proportion of patients responding. Studies comparing IIM and FCM 
      directly would be needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - The need for comparative data in spondyloarthritis.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/s13075-019-1812-3 [doi]
LID - 32
AB  - Spondyloarthritis comprises a group of inflammatory diseases, characterised by 
      inflammation within axial joints and/or peripheral arthritis, enthesitis and 
      dactylitis. An increasing number of biologic treatments, including biosimilars, are 
      available for the treatment of spondyloarthritis. Although there are a growing 
      number of randomised controlled trials assessing treatments in spondyloarthritis, 
      there is a paucity of data from head-to-head studies. Comparative data are required 
      so that clinicians and payers have the level of evidence required to inform clinical 
      decision-making and health economic assessments. In the absence of head-to-head 
      studies, statistical methods such as network meta-analyses and matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparisons (MAICs) are used for assessing comparative 
      effectiveness.Network meta-analysis can be used to compare treatments for trials 
      using a common comparator (e.g. placebo); however, for those without a common 
      comparator or where considerable heterogeneity exists between the study populations, 
      a MAIC that controls for differences in study design and baseline patient 
      characteristics may be used. MAICs, unlike network meta-analyses, are of value for 
      longer-term comparisons beyond the placebo-controlled phase of clinical trials, 
      which is important for chronic diseases requiring long-term treatment, like 
      spondyloarthritis. At present, there are a number of limitations that restrict the 
      effectiveness of MAIC, such as the poor availability of individual patient-level 
      data from trials, which results in patient-level data from one trial being compared 
      with published whole-population data from another. Despite these limitations, drug 
      reimbursement agencies are increasingly accepting MAIC as a means of comparative 
      effectiveness and greater methodological guidance is needed.This report highlights a 
      number of challenges that are specific to conducting comparative studies like MAIC 
      in spondyloarthritis, including disease heterogeneity, the paucity of biomarkers and 
      the duration of studies required for radiographic endpoints in this slow-progressing 
      disease.

      via a Common Comparator.

LID - S1098-3015(18)32270-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adjusted indirect comparisons (anchored via a common comparator) are an 
      integral part of health technology assessment. These methods are challenged when 
      differences between studies exist, including inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome 
      definitions, patient characteristics, as well as ensuring the choice of a common 
      comparator. OBJECTIVES: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) can address 
      these challenges, but the appropriate application of MAICs is uncertain. Examples 
      include whether to match between individual-level data and aggregate-level data 
      studies separately for treatment arms or to combine the arms, which matching 
      algorithm should be used, and whether to include the control treatment outcome 
      and/or covariates present in individual-level data. RESULTS: Results from seven 
      matching approaches applied to a continuous outcome in six simulated scenarios 
      demonstrated that when no effect modifiers were present, the matching methods were 
      equivalent to the unmatched Bucher approach. When effect modifiers were present, 
      matching methods (regardless of approach) outperformed the Bucher method. Matching 
      on arms separately produced more precise estimates compared with matching on total 
      moments, and for certain scenarios, matching including the control treatment outcome 
      did not produce the expected effect size. The entropy balancing approach was used to 
      determine whether there were any notable advantages over the method proposed by 
      Signorovitch et al. When unmeasured effect modifiers were present, no approach was 
      able to estimate the true treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the Bucher 
      approach (no matching), the MAICs examined demonstrated more accurate estimates, but 
      further research is required to understand these methods across an array of 
      situations.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy versus 
      chemotherapy and pembrolizumab monotherapy in the first-line treatment of squamous 
      non-small-cell lung cancer in the US.
PG  - 1241-1256
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2019.1571297 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To describe the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
      (carboplatin and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel; P + C) in metastatic, squamous, 
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in the US. Methods: A model comparing 
      P + C versus C alone is developed utilizing partitioned survival analysis. Primary 
      clinical efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility and safety data are derived 
      from the KEYNOTE-407 trial and projected over 20 years. Costs for drugs and non-drug 
      disease management are also incorporated. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of 
      P + C vs. pembrolizumab monotherapy (P) is evaluated via an indirect treatment 
      comparison, for patient subgroups with PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50% and 
      1-49%. Results: Overall, P + C is projected to increase life expectancy by 
      1.95 years vs. C (3.86 versus 1.91). The resultant ICER is $86,293/QALY. In patients 
      with PD-L1 ≥ 50%, 1-49% and <1 the corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratios (ICERs) are $99,777/QALY, $85,986/QALY and $87,507/QALY, respectively. Versus 
      P, in the PD-L1 ≥ 50% subgroup, P + C appears cost saving; however, this result 
      should be interpreted with caution as there is considerable uncertainty in the 
      relative efficacy of these comparators. Conclusions: Across all eligible patients, 
      the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is projected to approximately double 
      life expectancy, yielding an extension to a point not previously seen in metastatic 
      squamous NSCLC. Overall, and within all relevant PD-L1 subgroups, use of P + C 
      yields an ICER below $100,000/QALY, and can be a cost-effective first-line treatment 
      for eligible metastatic squamous NSCLC patients for whom chemotherapy is currently 
      administered. In the PD-L1 ≥ 50% subgroup, additional follow-up within trials of 
      pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and pembrolizumab monotherapy are needed to better 
      define cost-effectiveness between these comparators.

TI  - Is Shouldice the best NON-MESH inguinal hernia repair technique? A systematic review 
      and network metanalysis of randomized controlled trials comparing Shouldice and 
      Desarda.
PG  - 12-21

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines state that the Shouldice technique has lower 
      recurrence rates than other suture repairs and therefore is strongly recommended in 
      non-mesh inguinal hernia repair. Recently a new tissue repair technique has been 
      proposed by Desarda and studied in trials against Lichtenstein technique. METHODS: 
      The present study was performed according to the PRISMA Statement for Network 
      Meta-analysis and the AMSTAR 2 checklist. The method of network meta-analysis was 
      chosen to evaluate randomized controlled trial published on tissue repair and 
      comparing Lichtenstein respectively with Desarda and Shouldice techniques. The 
      following parameters: operative time, recurrence, complications (general, 
      intraoperative, Surgical Surgical Site Occurrences), VAS score on postoperative day 
      1, numbness, chronic pain and return to daily activities. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs, 
      involving 2791 patients, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were selected for 
      final analysis. The anchored indirect treatment comparison showed that Desarda's 
      technique requires a significantly shorter operative time (MD: -12.9 min; 95% CI: 
      -20.6 to -5.2) and has a quicker recovery (MD: -6.6 days; 95% CI: -11.7 to -1.4). 
      Outcomes concerning intraoperative complications, early postoperative pain, 
      seroma/hematoma, hydrocele and infection rates, recurrence, numbness and chronic 
      pain were similar among the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Desarda's hernia repair can 
      be a valuable alternative to Shouldice technique for the treatment of primary 
      inguinal hernia repair if a non-mesh technique is chosen, because of its 
      reproducibility and quicker postoperative recovery. We recommend performing well 
      designed prospective studies comparing both techniques directly.

TI  - Change in albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint for progression of kidney disease: a 
      meta-analysis of treatment effects in randomised clinical trials.
PG  - 128-139
LID - S2213-8587(18)30314-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/S2213-8587(18)30314-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Change in albuminuria has strong biological plausibility as a surrogate 
      endpoint for progression of chronic kidney disease, but empirical evidence to 
      support its validity is lacking. We aimed to determine the association between 
      treatment effects on early changes in albuminuria and treatment effects on clinical 
      endpoints and surrograte endpoints, to inform the use of albuminuria as a surrogate 
      endpoint in future randomised controlled trials. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we 
      searched PubMed for publications in English from Jan 1, 1946, to Dec 15, 2016, using 
      search terms including "chronic kidney disease", "chronic renal insufficiency", 
      "albuminuria", "proteinuria", and "randomized controlled trial"; key inclusion 
      criteria were quantifiable measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria at baseline 
      and within 12 months of follow-up and information on the incidence of end-stage 
      kidney disease. We requested use of individual patient data from the authors of 
      eligible studies. For all studies that the authors agreed to participate and that 
      had sufficient data, we estimated treatment effects on 6-month change in albuminuria 
      and the composite clinical endpoint of treated end-stage kidney disease, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL/min per 1·73 m(2), or doubling of 
      serum creatinine. We used a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression analysis to 
      relate the treatment effects on albuminuria to those on the clinical endpoint across 
      studies and developed a prediction model for the treatment effect on the clinical 
      endpoint on the basis of the treatment effect on albuminuria. FINDINGS: We 
      identified 41 eligible treatment comparisons from randomised trials (referred to as 
      studies) that provided sufficient patient-level data on 29 979 participants (21 206 
      [71%] with diabetes). Over a median follow-up of 3·4 years (IQR 2·3-4·2), 3935 (13%) 
      participants reached the composite clinical endpoint. Across all studies, with a 
      meta-regression slope of 0·89 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0·13-1·70), each 
      30% decrease in geometric mean albuminuria by the treatment relative to the control 
      was associated with an average 27% lower hazard for the clinical endpoint (95% BCI 
      5-45%; median R(2) 0·47, 95% BCI 0·02-0·96). The association strengthened after 
      restricting analyses to patients with baseline albuminuria of more than 30 mg/g (ie, 
      3·4 mg/mmol; R(2) 0·72, 0·05-0·99]). For future trials, the model predicts that 
      treatments that decrease the geometric mean albuminuria to 0·7 (ie, 30% decrease in 
      albuminuria) relative to the control will provide an average hazard ratio (HR) for 
      the clinical endpoint of 0·68, and 95% of sufficiently large studies would have HRs 
      between 0·47 and 0·95. INTERPRETATION: Our results support a role for change in 
      albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint for the progression of chronic kidney disease, 
      particularly in patients with high baseline albuminuria; for patients with low 
      baseline levels of albuminuria this association is less certain. FUNDING: US

TI  - Comparison of mHealth and Face-to-Face Interventions for Smoking Cessation Among 
      People Living With HIV: Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e203
LID - 10.2196/mhealth.9329 [doi]
LID - e203
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of smoking among people living with HIV (PLHIV) is higher 
      than that reported in the general population, and it is a significant risk factor 
      for noncommunicable diseases in this group. Mobile phone interventions to promote 
      healthier behaviors (mobile health, mHealth) have the potential to reach a large 
      number of people at a low cost. It has been hypothesized that mHealth interventions 
      may not be as effective as face-to-face strategies in achieving smoking cessation, 
      but there is no systematic evidence to support this, especially among PLHIV. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare two modes of intervention delivery (mHealth 
      vs face-to-face) for smoking cessation among PLHIV. METHODS: Literature on 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating effects of mHealth or face-to-face 
      intervention strategies on short-term (4 weeks to <6 months) and long-term (≥6 
      months) smoking abstinence among PLHIV was sought. We systematically reviewed 
      relevant RCTs and conducted pairwise meta-analyses to estimate relative treatment 
      effects of mHealth and face-to-face interventions using standard care as comparison. 
      Given the absence of head-to-head trials comparing mHealth with face-to-face 
      interventions, we performed adjusted indirect comparison meta-analyses to compare 
      these interventions. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies involving 1772 PLHIV met the 
      inclusion criteria. The average age of the study population was 45 years, and women 
      comprised about 37%. In the short term, mHealth-delivered interventions were 
      significantly more efficacious in increasing smoking cessation than no intervention 
      control (risk ratio, RR, 2.81, 95% CI 1.44-5.49; n=726) and face-to-face 
      interventions (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.13-4.72; n=726). In the short term, face-to-face 
      interventions were no more effective than no intervention in increasing smoking 
      cessation (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.94-1.58; n=1144). In terms of achieving long-term 
      results among PLHIV, there was no significant difference in the rates of smoking 
      cessation between those who received mHealth-delivered interventions, face-to-face 
      interventions, or no intervention. Trial sequential analysis showed that only 15.16% 
      (726/1304) and 5.56% (632/11,364) of the required information sizes were accrued to 
      accept or reject a 25% relative risk reduction for short- and long-term smoking 
      cessation treatment effects. In addition, sequential monitoring boundaries were not 
      crossed, indicating that the cumulative evidence may be unreliable and inconclusive. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with face-to-face interventions, mHealth-delivered 
      interventions can better increase smoking cessation rate in the short term. The 
      evidence that mHealth increases smoking cessation rate in the short term is 
      encouraging but not sufficient to allow a definitive conclusion presently. Future 
      research should focus on strategies for sustaining smoking cessation treatment 
      effects among PLHIV in the long term.

TI  - Modeling Covariate-Adjusted Survival for Economic Evaluations in Oncology.
PG  - 727-737
LID - 10.1007/s40273-018-0759-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In economic evaluations in oncology, adjusted survival 
      should be generated if imbalances in prognostic/predictive factors across treatment 
      arms are present. To date, no formal guidance has been developed regarding how such 
      adjustments should be made. We compared various covariate-adjusted survival modeling 
      approaches, as applied to the ENDEAVOR trial in multiple myeloma that assessed 
      carfilzomib plus dexamethasone (Cd) versus bortezomib plus dexamethasone (Vd). 
      METHODS: Overall survival (OS) data and baseline characteristics were used for a 
      subgroup (bortezomib-naïve/one prior therapy). Four adjusted survival modeling 
      approaches were compared: propensity score weighting followed by fitting a Weibull 
      model to the two arms of the balanced data (weighted data approach); fitting a 
      multiple Weibull regression model including prognostic/predictive covariates to the 
      two arms to predict survival using the mean value of each covariate and using the 
      average of patient-specific survival predictions; and applying an adjusted hazard 
      ratio (HR) derived from a Cox proportional hazard model to the baseline risk 
      estimated for Vd. RESULTS: The mean OS estimated by the weighted data approach was 
      6.85 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.62-10.70) for Cd, 4.68 years (95% CI 
      3.46-6.74) for Vd, and 2.17 years (95% CI 0.18-5.06) for the difference. Although 
      other approaches estimated similar differences, using the mean value of covariates 
      appeared to yield skewed survival estimates (mean OS was 7.65 years for Cd and 
      5.40 years for Vd), using the average of individual predictions had limited external 
      validity (implausible long-term OS predictions with > 10% of the Vd population alive 
      after 30 years), and using the adjusted HR approach overestimated uncertainty 
      (difference in mean OS was 2.03, 95% CI - 0.17 to 6.19). CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted 
      survival modeling based on weighted or matched data approaches provides a flexible 
      and robust method to correct for covariate imbalances in economic evaluations. The 
      conclusions of our study may be generalizable to other settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01568866 (ENDEAVOR trial).

TI  - Allowing for informative missingness in aggregate data meta-analysis with continuous 
      or binary outcomes: Extensions to metamiss.
PG  - 716-740
AB  - Missing outcome data can invalidate the results of randomized trials and their 
      meta-analysis. However, addressing missing data is often a challenging issue because 
      it requires untestable assumptions. The impact of missing outcome data on the 
      meta-analysis summary effect can be explored by assuming a relationship between the 
      outcome in the observed and the missing participants via an informative missingness 
      parameter. The informative missingness parameters cannot be estimated from the 
      observed data, but they can be specified, with associated uncertainty, using 
      evidence external to the meta-analysis, such as expert opinion. The use of 
      informative missingness parameters in pairwise meta-analysis of aggregate data with 
      binary outcomes has been previously implemented in Stata by the metamiss command. In 
      this article, we present the new command metamiss2, which is an extension of 
      metamiss for binary or continuous data in pairwise or network meta-analysis. The 
      command can be used to explore the robustness of results to different assumptions 
      about the missing data via sensitivity analysis.

TI  - An efficacy comparison of anti-vascular growth factor agents and laser 
      photocoagulation in diabetic macular edema: a network meta-analysis incorporating 
      individual patient-level data.
PG  - 340
LID - 10.1186/s12886-018-1006-9 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: This was an updated network meta-analysis (NMA) of anti-vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents and laser photocoagulation in patients with 
      diabetic macular edema (DME). Unlike previous NMA that used meta-regression to 
      account for potential confounding by systematic variation in treatment effect 
      modifiers across studies, this update incorporated individual patient-level data 
      (IPD) regression to provide more robust adjustment. METHODS: An updated review was 
      conducted to identify randomised controlled trials for inclusion in a Bayesian NMA. 
      The network included intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL) 2 mg bimonthly (2q8) after 5 
      initial doses, ranibizumab 0.5 mg as-needed (PRN), ranibizumab 0.5 mg 
      treat-and-extend (T&E), and laser photocoagulation. Outcomes included in the 
      analysis were change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), measured using an Early 
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, and patients with ≥10 and ≥ 15 
      ETDRS letter gains/losses at 12 months. Analyses were performed using networks 
      restricted to IPD-only and IPD and aggregate data with (i) no covariable adjustment, 
      (ii) covariable adjustment for baseline BVCA assuming common interaction effects 
      (against reference treatment), and (iii) covariable adjustments specific to each 
      treatment comparison (restricted to IPD-only network). RESULTS: Thirteen trials were 
      included in the analysis. IVT-AFL 2q8 was superior to laser in all analyses. IVT-AFL 
      2q8 showed strong evidence of superiority (95% credible interval [CrI] did not cross 
      null) versus ranibizumab 0.5 mg PRN for mean change in BCVA (mean difference 5.20, 
      95% CrI 1.90-8.52 ETDRS letters), ≥15 ETDRS letter gain (odds ratio [OR] 2.30, 95% 
      CrI 1.12-4.20), and ≥10 ETDRS letter loss (OR 0.25, 95% CrI 0.05-0.74) (IPD and 
      aggregate random-effects model with baseline BCVA adjustment). IVT-AFL 2q8 was not 
      superior to ranibizumab 0.5 mg T&E for mean change in BCVA (mean difference 5.15, 
      95% CrI -0.26-10.61 ETDRS letters) (IPD and aggregate random-effects model). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This NMA, which incorporated IPD to improve analytic robustness, showed 
      evidence of superiority of IVT-AFL 2q8 to laser and ranibizumab 0.5 mg PRN. These 
      results were irrespective of adjustment for baseline BCVA.

AB  - The number needed to treat (NNT) is considered an intuitive as well as popular 
      effect measure. The aims of this review were to 1) explain why we cannot compare 
      trial-specific NNT estimates for the competing treatments evaluated in different 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2) outline the principles of how relative 
      treatment effects of different trials can be compared and results can be presented 
      as NNT, without violating the principles of valid between-trial comparisons. Our 
      premise is that ratio measures for relative treatment effects of response outcomes 
      are less prone to effect modification than absolute difference measures of response 
      outcomes. Accordingly, any between-trial comparisons of the efficacy of competing 
      interventions using the study-specific ORs are less likely to be invalid or biased 
      than comparisons based on the study-specific NNT estimates. However, 
      treatment-specific ORs obtained from a meta-analysis or taken directly from an 
      individual study can be transformed into consistent treatment-specific NNT estimates 
      that allow for credible comparisons of treatments when these ratio measures are 
      applied to the same reference response estimate. The theoretical discussion is 
      illustrated with a relevant indirect comparison of biologics for the treatment of 
      ulcerative colitis. Between-trial comparisons directly based on the NNT of 
      individual trials may result in erroneous conclusions and should be avoided. 
      Treatment-specific NNT estimates need to be based on the same probability of 
      response with the common reference treatment against which the interventions are 
      compared.

TI  - Axitinib, cabozantinib, or everolimus in the treatment of prior sunitinib-treated 
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma: results of matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison analyses.
PG  - 1271

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of head-to-head trials comparing axitinib with 
      cabozantinib or everolimus, the aim of this study was to conduct an indirect 
      comparison of their relative efficacy in patients with metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma (mRCC), using data from the AXIS and METEOR trials. METHODS: 
      Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in prior sunitinib-treated 
      patients with mRCC were compared by conducting matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      (MAIC) analyses, including base-case and sensitivity analyses. Individual 
      patient-level data from prior sunitinib-treated patients who received axitinib in 
      AXIS were weighted to match published baseline characteristics of prior 
      sunitinib-treated patients who received either cabozantinib or everolimus in METEOR. 
      RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in PFS (aHR [adjusted 
      hazard ratio] = 1.15 [CI: 0.82-1.63]) and OS (aHR = 1.00 [CI: 0.69-1.46]) between 
      axitinib versus cabozantinib in the base-case analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, 
      PFS (aHR = 1.39 [CI: 1.00-1.92]) and OS (aHR = 1.35 [CI: 0.95-1.92]) were shorter 
      for axitinib compared with cabozantinib; however, the OS difference was not 
      statistically significant. Axitinib was associated with significantly longer PFS 
      compared with everolimus in the base-case (aHR = 0.53 [CI: 0.36-0.80]) and 
      sensitivity analyses (aHR = 0.63 [CI: 0.45-0.88]), respectively. Results suggested 
      an OS benefit for axitinib versus everolimus in base-case analyses (aHR = 0.63 [CI: 
      0.42-0.96]); however, the difference in OS in the sensitivity analysis was not 
      statistically significant (aHR = 0.84 [CI: 0.59-1.18]). CONCLUSIONS: MAIC analyses 
      suggest PFS and OS for axitinib and cabozantinib are dependent on the Memorial Sloan 
      Kettering Cancer Center definition used; in the base-case analysis, there was no 
      significant difference in PFS and OS between axitinib and cabozantinib. In the 
      sensitivity analysis, PFS in favour of cabozantinib was significant; however, the 
      trend for prolonged OS with cabozantinib was not significant. For axitinib and 
      everolimus, MAIC analyses indicate patients treated with axitinib may have an 
      improved PFS and OS benefit when compared to everolimus. Disparities between the 
      base-case and sensitivity analyses in this study underscore the importance of 
      adjusting for the differences in baseline characteristics and that naïve indirect 
      comparisons are not appropriate.

AB  - AIM: The cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences in BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma. 
      MATERIALS & METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed to estimate 
      total costs and health outcomes over a patient's lifetime (30 years). Efficacy was 
      based on the CheckMate 067/069 trials and a matching-adjusted-indirect comparison 
      between immuno-oncology and targeted therapies. Safety, cost (in US dollars; US 
      third-party payer perspective) and health-related quality-of-life inputs were based 
      on published literature. RESULTS: Estimated survival gain was higher for sequences 
      initiating with anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 than for anti-PD-1 monotherapy or BRAF+MEK 
      inhibitors. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained for first-line 
      anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 was US$54,273 versus first-line anti-PD-1 and $79,124 versus 
      first-line BRAF+MEK inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Initiating treatment with anti-PD-1 + 
      anti-CTLA-4 was more cost-effective than initiation with anti-PD-1 monotherapy or 
      BRAF+MEK inhibitors.

TI  - Pembrolizumab for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer Where Cisplatin 
      is Unsuitable: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology 
      Appraisal.
PG  - 1073-1080
LID - 10.1007/s40273-018-0750-2 [doi]
AB  - As part of its Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute for 
      Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (Merck Sharp & Dohme) of 
      pembrolizumab (Keytruda(®)) to submit evidence of its clinical and cost 
      effectiveness for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer 
      where cisplatin is unsuitable. The School of Health and Related Research Technology 
      Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the 
      independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the 
      evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the 
      company's submission (CS) to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the CS for 
      pembrolizumab was based on one phase II, single-arm, open-label, non-randomised 
      study (KEYNOTE-052), while the evidence for the comparator (carboplatin plus 
      gemcitabine) was based on four studies, including one randomised controlled trial 
      and three cohort studies. In the absence of head-to-head trials, the company 
      conducted an indirect treatment comparison for both progression-free survival (PFS) 
      and overall survival (OS), by firstly adjusting cross-study differences using a 
      simulated treatment comparison approach and then synthesizing the evidence based on 
      an assumption of constant hazard ratios using a standard meta-analysis model and 
      time-varying hazard ratios using fractional polynomial models. The treatment effect 
      of pembrolizumab was more favourable in the adjusted population compared with the 
      observed effect in the KEYNOTE-052 study. The company submitted a de novo 
      partitioned survival cohort simulation model, which partitions the OS time into PFS 
      and post-progression survival. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratio (ICER) for pembrolizumab compared with carboplatin plus gemcitabine was 
      estimated to be £37,081 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, based on the 
      results within the company's health economic model. Following a critique of the 
      model, for their preferred base case the ERG corrected some minor model errors, 
      chose a progression approach for estimating utilities, and revised the extrapolation 
      of PFS and OS. The ERG's probabilistic base case ICER was estimated to be £67,068 
      per QALY gained. The ERG also undertook a range of exploratory sensitivity analyses 
      which suggested that the ICER was highly uncertain. In particular, the choices of 
      extrapolation for the OS of pembrolizumab and the stopping rule for pembrolizumab 
      had the largest impacts on the ICER. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended 
      pembrolizumab for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for treating locally 
      advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had 
      platinum-containing chemotherapy, provided that pembrolizumab was stopped at 2 years 
      of uninterrupted treatment, or earlier if the disease progresses, and the conditions 
      of the managed access agreement for pembrolizumab are followed.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of ribociclib versus palbociclib in the first-line 
      treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in Spain.
PG  - 773-790
LID - 10.2147/CEOR.S178934 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ribociclib 
      compared to palbociclib, both in combination with letrozole, in the first-line 
      treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast 
      cancer (ABC) from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System (NHS). 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Disease progression was simulated with a partitioned survival 
      model developed from the parameterization and extrapolation of survival curves of 
      postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- ABC from clinical trials with ribociclib or 
      palbociclib, both in combination with letrozole. The model was structured on the 
      basis of three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, and death), with 
      a 1-month cycle length and inclusion of subsequent treatments administered for 
      disease progression, over a time horizon of 15 years. Clinical, economic, and 
      quality of life parameters were drawn from clinical trials and the literature. The 
      use of resources and clinical practice in the Spanish setting was validated by a 
      panel of experts. The Spanish NHS perspective was adopted, taking into account 
      exclusively direct health costs from 2017 expressed in Euros. Drug prices used were 
      the reported ex-factory prices. Uncertainty of the parameters and robustness of the 
      results were evaluated using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
      (2,000 iterations). RESULTS: This cost-effectiveness analysis showed a greater 
      benefit (0.437 and 0.285 life-years gained [LYGs] and quality-adjusted life years 
      [QALYs] gained, respectively) and a slightly higher cost (€439.86) for 
      ribociclib+letrozole compared to palbociclib+letrozole. The resulting incremental 
      cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios were €1,007.69 per LYG and €1,543.62 per 
      QALY gained, respectively. The results of the multiple sensitivity analyses showed 
      limited dispersion of the outcomes, thus corroborating their robustness. CONCLUSION: 
      From the NHS perspective, considering the most commonly established 
      willingness-to-pay thresholds in the Spanish setting, ribociclib+letrozole would 
      represent a cost-effective therapeutic option compared to palbociclib+letrozole in 
      the first-line treatment of HR+/HER2- ABC in postmenopausal women.

TI  - An indirect treatment comparison of the efficacy of patisiran and tafamidis for the 
      treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.
PG  - 473-481
LID - 10.1080/14656566.2018.1554648 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) is a 
      progressive, life-threatening disease. Until recently, tafamidis was the only 
      approved pharmacotherapy. Patisiran significantly improved polyneuropathy and 
      quality of life (QoL) in the phase III APOLLO trial. In the absence of direct 
      comparisons, this analysis aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of tafamidis 
      and patisiran in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      Randomized controlled trial evidence for tafamidis was identified by systematic 
      literature review. Indirect treatment comparisons were performed using the standard 
      pairwise Bucher method for endpoints used in both APOLLO and the tafamidis Fx-005 
      trial: change from baseline in Neuropathy Impairment Score-lower limbs (NIS-LL), 
      Norfolk QoL-Diabetic Neuropathy questionnaire (QoL-DN), NIS-LL response, and mBMI 
      vs. placebo. Inter-trial population differences were assessed by sensitivity 
      analysis. RESULTS: The base-case analysis (FAP Stage 1 APOLLO patients vs. 
      intent-to-treat Fx-005 population) suggested patisiran had a greater treatment 
      effect vs. tafamidis for all endpoints, with significant improvements in mean change 
      in NIS-LL (-5.49) and QoL-DN (-13.10) from baseline to Month 18. Similar trends were 
      observed in all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of direct 
      comparisons, this analysis suggests patisiran has a greater treatment effect than 
      tafamidis in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.

TI  - Budget impact analysis of secukinumab versus adalimumab in the treatment of 
      ankylosing spondylitis.
PG  - 151-157
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2018.1551227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biologic treatments have enhanced the treatment outcomes of patients 
      with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Until recently, TNF-alpha-inhibitors have 
      been the only biologics approved for the treatment of active AS. The objective of 
      this study was to assess the potential financial impact of the first non-TNF-alpha 
      biologic secukinumab (fully human IL-17A-inhibitor) vs adalimumab 
      (TNF-alpha-inhibitor) in the treatment of AS in Finland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 
      this model-based budget impact analysis, patients were treated either with 
      secukinumab (150 mg) or adalimumab (40 mg). The number of patients and market share 
      of different biologics were based on national reimbursement registry data. 
      Adalimumab was the most commonly used biologic treatment for AS, and in the base 
      case analysis all adalimumab patients are assumed to switch to secukinumab. Response 
      rates were based on a matching-adjusted indirect comparison between secukinumab and 
      adalimumab. Patients not achieving response were switched to another biologic 
      treatment. RESULTS: Treating AS patients with secukinumab instead of adalimumab 
      leads to potential savings of 18.2 million euros within a 5-year time period. The 
      total costs within the follow-up time were 59.5 million euros and 77.7 million euros 
      with and without secukinumab, respectively. According to sensitivity analyses, a 
      higher adoption rate of secukinumab corresponds to higher potential savings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Secukinumab is a cost-saving treatment option compared with adalimumab 
      in the treatment of AS in Finland. More patients could be treated with a biologic by 
      allocating resources more efficiently.

TI  - Calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate aerosol foam vs. apremilast, 
      methotrexate, acitretin or fumaric acid esters for the treatment of plaque 
      psoriasis: a matching-adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 1107-1115
LID - 10.1111/jdv.15369 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plaque psoriasis has significant impact on patients' quality of life. 
      Topical therapy is considered the treatment mainstay for mild-to-moderate disease 
      according to guidelines. Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) 
      [0.005%/0.05%] aerosol foam is indicated for psoriasis vulgaris treatment in adults. 
      Cal/BD foam trials demonstrated improved efficacy and similar safety in this 
      population. Psoriasis treatment is complicated by the broad range of disease 
      presentation, variability and therapeutic options; particularly decisions on 
      transition from topical to non-biologic systemic treatment are difficult. Assessing 
      comparative effectiveness of treatment options provides meaningful value to 
      treatment decisions. OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy of Cal/BD foam individual 
      patient data from pooled trials with efficacy of non-biologic systemic treatments 
      based on aggregated patient characteristics and treatment outcomes. METHODS: 
      Individual data from four Cal/BD foam trials in 749 psoriasis patients were pooled 
      to conduct matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. Literature review identified 
      non-biologic systemic treatment trials where methods, populations and outcomes align 
      with Cal/BD foam trials. Of 3090 screened publications, four studies of apremilast, 
      methotrexate, acitretin or fumaric acid esters (FAE) were included. RESULTS: After 
      baseline matching, patients treated with 4 weeks of Cal/BD foam had greater 
      Physician's Global Assessment 0/1 response compared to those treated with 16 weeks 
      of apremilast (52.7% vs. 30.4%; P < 0.001). Patients treated with Cal/BD foam had 
      significantly greater Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response at Week 4 
      compared to 16 weeks of apremilast treatment (51.1% vs. 21.6%; P < 0.001). Cal/BD 
      foam patients demonstrated significantly greater PASI 75 response improvements at 
      Week 4 vs. 12 weeks of methotrexate (50.8% vs. 33.5%; P < 0.001) or acitretin (50.9% 
      vs. 31.7%; P = 0.009), and comparable response to FAE (42.4% vs. 47.0%; P = 0.451). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent treatment advances, unmet needs for psoriasis patients 
      remain. Cal/BD foam offers improved efficacy in baseline matched psoriasis patients 
      compared to apremilast, methotrexate or acitretin, and comparable efficacy to FAE.

TI  - Dinutuximab Beta for Treating Neuroblastoma: An Evidence Review Group and Decision 
      Support Unit Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.
PG  - 985-993
LID - 10.1007/s40273-018-0744-0 [doi]
AB  - As part of its Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, the UK National Institute 
      for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (EUSA Pharma) of 
      dinutuximab beta (Qarziba(®)) to submit evidence of its clinical and cost 
      effectiveness for treating neuroblastoma. The BMJ Technology Assessment Group 
      (BMJ-TAG) was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG), reviewing the 
      submission from the company. The Decision Support Unit (DSU) was commissioned to 
      review additional evidence submitted by the company and to undertake further 
      analyses. This article presents the critical review of the company's submissions by 
      the ERG and DSU, further analyses undertaken by the DSU, and the outcome of the NICE 
      guidance. The clinical effectiveness for dinutuximab beta was derived from a phase 
      III randomised controlled trial (RCT) that assessed the safety and efficacy of the 
      addition of interleukin (IL)-2 to dinutuximab beta plus isotretinoin. This trial did 
      not inform the relative effectiveness of dinutuximab beta versus isotretinoin alone, 
      which was established practice in the UK for maintenance treatment. In the absence 
      of direct evidence, the company initially conducted a naïve indirect treatment 
      comparison against a historical control, and later performed a matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison (MAIC) against the isotretinoin arm of an RCT comparing 
      dinutuximab alpha and isotretinoin. The company submitted a partitioned survival 
      analysis model that calculated the incremental cost effectiveness of dinutuximab 
      beta versus isotretinoin. The company's original incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratio (ICER) was £22,338 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. However, the 
      ERG were concerned that the company's ICER was not suitable for decision making, and 
      thus carried out initial exploratory analysis as a first step to overcome the naïve 
      estimation of treatment effectiveness in the model. The ERG's analysis estimated an 
      ICER of £111,858 per QALY gained. In their revised analysis incorporating the MAIC 
      and other changes as requested by the appraisal committee, the company's ICER was 
      £24,661 per QALY gained. When the DSU incorporated longer-term isotretinoin data and 
      made corrections to the model, the ICER increased to between £62,886 and £87,164 per 
      QALY gained depending on the choice of survival model. A confidential Patient Access 
      Scheme (PAS) decreased the ICERs. The ICERs with the PAS were over £40,000 per QALY 
      gained, but the NICE committee additionally considered the patient population and 
      its size, the disease severity, the potential for significant survival benefit and 
      uncaptured health benefits, and recommended dinutuximab beta as a treatment option, 
      subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the PAS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an auto-immune disorder characterized 
      by enhanced platelet destruction and, subsequently, the potential for increased 
      bleeding. Thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists have recently emerged as 
      promising therapies for ITP patients who are refractory to other treatments. While 
      eltrombopag (EPAG) is the only TPO-R agonist US Food and Drug Administration 
      approved for use in pediatric patients, romiplostin (ROMI) has been used in Phase 
      III clinical studies. METHODS: A cost-consequence model (CCM) was developed to 
      evaluate the costs of EPAG, ROMI, and watch-and-rescue (W&R) in relation to their 
      respective treatment outcomes in previously-treated pediatric chronic ITP (cITP) 
      over a 26-week time horizon. The costs of drugs, administration, routine care, 
      rescue medications, adverse events, and mortality were included. Data on platelet 
      count response rate, bleeding events, and adverse events were derived from all 
      relevant identified Phase III-registered clinical trials, health outcomes were 
      compared via indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: The overall estimated cost of 
      EPAG per patient was US$66,550, compared to US$101,056 for ROMI and US$32,720 for 
      W&R. EPAG's lower cost compared to ROMI was largely due to lower drug costs 
      (US$62,202 vs US$84,396), administration costs (US$0 vs US$1,955), and significantly 
      lower costs due to severe bleeding (US$354 vs US$10,191). When assessing cost per 
      severe bleeding event avoided, EPAG was dominant over ROMI (less expensive and more 
      effective). EPAG was again dominant over ROMI when assessing the cost per responder 
      and per bleeding event (any grade). Sensitivity analysis was consistent with the 
      base case findings. CONCLUSION: EPAG was the preferred TPO-R agonist to treat cITP 
      when indirectly compared to ROMI, largely driven by its favorable severe bleeding 
      outcomes and lower drug and administration costs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists eltrombopag (EPAG) and romiplostim 
      (ROMI) are treatment options for adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (cITP) 
      who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids or immunoglobulins. 
      METHODS: A cost-consequence model was developed to evaluate the costs relative to 
      treatment success of EPAG, ROMI, and watch and rescue (W&R) in previously treated 
      patients. The primary endpoint assessed was severe bleeding, derived from all 
      identified phase III registered clinical trials. Health outcomes were compared via 
      indirect treatment comparison. Costs incorporated in the model included drug and 
      administration, routine care, rescue medications, bleeding-related adverse events, 
      other adverse events, and mortality costs. A trial (26-week) time horizon was used, 
      as certain endpoints used in the model were bound to within-trial results. RESULTS: 
      In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, the overall estimated cost per patient for 
      EPAG was US$66,560 compared to US$91,039 for ROMI and US$30,099 for W&R. Compared to 
      the ITT population, the difference in cost between EPAG and ROMI was slightly 
      greater in splenectomized patients (US$65,998 for EPAG compared to US$91,485 for 
      ROMI) and slightly less in non-splenectomized patients (US$67,151 for EPAG compared 
      to US$91,455 for ROMI), though the overall trend remained the same. When assessing 
      cost per severe bleeding event avoided in the ITT population, EPAG dominated (less 
      expensive, more effective) ROMI. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. 
      CONCLUSION: EPAG was preferred over ROMI in the treatment of cITP, largely driven by 
      the reduction in severe bleeding events associated with its use.

TI  - Effect of beta-blocker therapy on clinical outcomes, safety, health-related quality 
      of life and functional capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease (COPD): a protocol for a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with 
      multiple treatment comparison.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have a 
      clinical indication for beta-blocker therapy, are often not prescribed such 
      medication, despite evidence suggesting that beta-blockers are not associated with 
      adverse respiratory outcomes. The primary objective of this systematic review and 
      meta-analysis is to examine the class effect of beta-blocker use in patients with 
      COPD. We will focus on a broad range of endpoints including, clinical, safety, and 
      patient-centric outcomes such as health related quality of life (HRQoL) and 
      functional capacity. A secondary objective is to explore potential within-class 
      variation in the effects of beta-blockers among patients with COPD, and rank 
      individual agents according to their relative benefit(s). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 
      MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
      Health Literature (CINAHL) databases will be systematically searched, from inception 
      to present, to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and other prospective 
      and interventional studies of beta-blocker use in patients with COPD which report on 
      the outcomes of interest. Relative treatment effects with respect to mortality, COPD 
      exacerbations, all-cause hospitalisation, lung function, HRQoL and exercise capacity 
      will be summarised by meta-analysis. Individual treatments (agents) will be compared 
      in a Bayesian network meta-analysis including RCT and observational data, if 
      feasible. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results of the study will be submitted for 
      publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Only previously published aggregate data 
      will be used for the purpose of this review. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation with Chondrosphere for Treating Articular 
      Cartilage Defects in the Knee: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single 
      Technology Appraisal.
PG  - 879-886
LID - 10.1007/s40273-018-0737-z [doi]
AB  - Chondrosphere (Spherox) is a form of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). It 
      is licensed for repair of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral 
      condyle and the patella of the knee with defect sizes up to 10 cm(2) in adults. In a 
      single technology appraisal (STA) [TA508] undertaken by the National Institute of 
      Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Warwick Evidence was the Evidence Review Group 
      (ERG) invited to independently review the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, 
      Co.Don. The clinical effectiveness data came from their COWISI randomised controlled 
      trial (RCT), which compared Chondrosphere with microfracture (MF). The timing of 
      this appraisal was unfortunate given that MF was no longer the most relevant 
      comparator because NICE had contemporaneously published guidance approving ACI in 
      place of MF. Moreover, the COWISI RCT enrolled mostly patients with small defect 
      sizes. Evidence of clinical effectiveness for Chondrosphere used in people with 
      larger defect size came from another RCT, which compared three doses of 
      Chondrosphere and that by design could not provide evidence comparing Chondrosphere 
      to any other forms of ACI. To estimate the relative clinical performance of 
      Chondrosphere versus other ACI, Co.Don conducted an indirect treatment comparison by 
      network meta-analyses (NMA). The NMA was flawed in that the distribution of 
      population characteristics that are effect modifiers greatly differed across the 
      treatment comparisons of the network. The ERG questioned both the appropriateness of 
      the NMA and the validity of the resulting estimates. Co.Don estimated the 
      cost-effectiveness of Chondrosphere using a lifetime Markov model with all patients 
      receiving the first repair during the first cycle of the model then moving into one 
      of three health states: success, no further repair (NFR), or a second repair, if 
      necessary. Subsequent to the first cycle, those who were a success either remained a 
      success or moved to second repair. All those in NFR remained in NFR. The 
      cost-effectiveness of Chondrosphere compared to other ACI forms relied on the 
      clinical effectiveness estimates of success and failure rates obtained from the 
      company's indirect comparisons, the validity of which the ERG questioned. The 
      company revised cost-effectiveness estimates for Chondrosphere versus MF and for 
      Chondrosphere versus matrix-applied characterised autologous cultured chondrocyte 
      implant (MACI) were £4360 and around £18,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained, 
      respectively. NICE recommended ACI using Chondrosphere for treating symptomatic 
      articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and patella of the knee in adults 
      only if certain requirements were met.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nivolumab and cabozantinib, two new treatment options for 
      previously-treated advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (aRCC), have recently 
      been approved. METHODS: Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data 
      extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Indirect treatment comparisons were carried 
      out by directly assessing HR differences and statistical modeling of Kaplan-Meier 
      curves from these two trials. RESULTS: Publications identified showed that no 
      head-to-head comparisons had been carried out. Two indirect treatment comparisons 
      used agreed that there was no significant difference in OS between cabozantinib and 
      nivolumab and that cabozantinib significantly improved PFS compared to nivolumab. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The field of aRCC treatments is evolving rapidly, creating 
      opportunities for individualized treatments and challenges for clinicians to keep up 
      with the evidence. In lieu of availability of direct comparisons of all options, 
      advanced modeling results presented herein can help to inform and improve 
      personalized treatments.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of secukinumab and adalimumab in ankylosing spondylitis as 
      assessed by matching-adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 216-223
LID - 10.5152/eurjrheum.2018.18162 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison was used to assess the comparative 
      effectiveness of secukinumab 150 mg and adalimumab 40 mg in biologic-naïve patients 
      with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) for up to 1 year. METHODS: Pooled individual 
      patient data from the secukinumab arms of MEASURE 1 (NCT01358175) and MEASURE 2 
      (NCT01649375) trials (n=197) were matched against the ATLAS (NCT00085644) adalimumab 
      population (n=208). Logistic regression analysis was used to determined weights to 
      match for age, sex, Bath AS Functional Index, C-reactive protein levels, and 
      previous tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy. Recalculated Assessment of 
      SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 20 and 40 responses at weeks 8, 12, 
      16, 24, and 52 from MEASURE 1/2 (effective sample size=120) were compared with those 
      of ATLAS. Anchored (placebo-adjusted) comparisons were possible until week 12, and 
      unanchored (non-placebo-adjusted) comparisons were necessary thereafter. RESULTS: 
      For placebo-anchored ASAS 20 and 40 comparisons up to week 12, there were no 
      differences between secukinumab and adalimumab. For unanchored comparisons at week 
      16, ASAS 20 was higher for secukinumab [odds ratio 1.60 (95% confidence interval, 
      1.01-2.54); p=0.047]; at week 24, ASAS 20 and 40 were higher for secukinumab [1.76 
      (1.11-2.79); p=0.017 and 1.79 (1.14-2.82); p=0.012, respectively]; and at week 52, 
      ASAS 40 was higher for secukinumab [1.54 (1.06-2.23); p=0.023] than for adalimumab. 
      CONCLUSION: There were no differences observed in placebo-adjusted ASAS 20 and 40 
      responses up to 12 weeks between secukinumab- and adalimumab-treated patients with 
      ankylosing spondylitis. After week 12, secukinumab demonstrated signs of greater 
      improvement in non-placebo-adjusted ASAS 20 and 40 responses than adalimumab.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of first-line ceritinib and crizotinib in advanced or 
      metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small cell lung cancer: an 
      adjusted indirect comparison with external controls.
PG  - 105-111
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2018.1541443 [doi]
AB  - Objective: In the absence of head-to-head trials, this study indirectly compared 
      progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between ceritinib and 
      crizotinib among patients with previously untreated advanced anaplastic lymphoma 
      kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods: A 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison method was implemented to adjust for 
      cross-trial differences in patient characteristics between ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014 
      trials. Patient-level data from ASCEND-4 and published summary data from PROFILE 
      1014 were used. Patients in ASCEND-4 were reweighted to match average baseline 
      characteristics (i.e. age, sex, race, tumor histology, ECOG score, smoking status, 
      extent of disease, and presence of brain metastases) reported for PROFILE 1014 
      patients using propensity score weighting. PFS and OS were then compared between 
      balanced populations.Results: ASCEND-4 included more current smokers (8.0% vs 4.4%) 
      and fewer patients under the age of 65 years (78.5% vs 84.0%) compared to PROFILE 
      1014. After matching, these and all other patient characteristics were balanced 
      between the two trial populations. Compared to crizotinib, ceritinib was associated 
      with a significantly longer PFS (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] (HR 
      [CI]) = 0.64 [0.47-0.87]; median PFS: 25.2 vs 10.8 months, log-rank 
      p-value = 0.003). OS did not differ significantly, with a HR of 0.82 [0.54-1.27] for 
      ceritinib compared to crizotinib.Conclusions: In the adjusted indirect comparison 
      with external controls, the second generation ALK inhibitor, ceritinib, was 
      associated with a significantly prolonged PFS compared to crizotinib as first-line 
      treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC.

      COPD: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - 3203-3231
LID - 10.2147/COPD.S173472 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the comparative efficacy of short-acting muscarinic antagonists 
      (SAMAs), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), LAMA in combination with 
      long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs; LAMA/LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in 
      combination with LABA (ICS/LABAs) for the maintenance treatment of COPD. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We systematically reviewed 74 randomized controlled trials (74,832 
      participants) published up to 15 November 2017, which compared any of the 
      interventions (SAMA [ipratropium], LAMA [aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium, 
      umeclidinium], LAMA/LABA [aclidinium/formoterol, indacaterol/glycopyrronium, 
      tiotropium/olodaterol, umeclidinium/vilanterol] and ICS/LABA 
      [fluticasone/vilanterol, budesonide/formoterol, salmeterol/fluticasone]) with each 
      other or with placebo. A random-effects network meta-analysis combining direct and 
      indirect evidence was conducted to examine the change from baseline in trough 
      FEV(1), transition dyspnea index, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and 
      frequency of adverse events at weeks 12 and 24. RESULTS: Inconsistency models were 
      not statistically significant for all outcomes. LAMAs, LAMA/LABAs and ICS/LABAs led 
      to a significantly greater improvement in trough FEV(1) compared with placebo and 
      SAMA monotherapy at weeks 12 and 24. All LAMA/LABAs, except aclidinium/formoterol, 
      were statistically significantly better than LAMA monotherapy and ICS/LABAs in 
      improving trough FEV(1). Among the LAMAs, umeclidinium showed statistically 
      significant improvement in trough FEV(1) at week 12 compared to tiotropium and 
      glycopyrronium, but the results were not clinically significant. LAMA/LABAs had the 
      highest probabilities of being ranked the best agents in FEV(1) improvement. Similar 
      trends were observed for the transition dyspnea index and St George's Respiratory 
      Questionnaire outcomes. There were no significant differences in the incidences of 
      adverse events among all treatment options. CONCLUSION: LAMA/LABA showed the 
      greatest improvement in trough FEV(1) at weeks 12 and 24 compared with the other 
      inhaled drug classes, while SAMA showed the least improvement. There were no 
      significant differences among the LAMAs and LAMA/LABAs within their respective 
      classes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of essential tremor patients are refractory to medication and 
      require alternative treatment to achieve tremor relief. This study aimed to identify 
      and analyze evidence supporting the use of the emerging magnetic resonance-guided 
      focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) compared to alternative stimulatory and ablative 
      interventions for the treatment of medication-refractory essential tremor: 
      radiofrequency thalamotomy, unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS), and 
      stereotactic radiosurgery. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to 
      identify clinical, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and economic evidence for 
      each intervention. Because of the lack of comparative evidence captured, a 
      feasibility assessment was performed to determine possible comparisons between 
      interventions, and newly established matching-adjusted indirect comparison and 
      simulated treatment comparison techniques were used to conduct a comparison between 
      unilateral DBS aggregate data and MRgFUS individual patient data. RESULTS: The 
      systematic literature review identified 1,559 records, and screening yielded 46 
      relevant articles. The captured studies demonstrated that radiofrequency 
      thalamotomy, DBS, stereotactic radiosurgery, and MRgFUS all exhibit clinical 
      efficacy, with variation in onset and duration of tremor relief, and are each 
      associated with a unique safety profile. The matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      and simulated treatment comparison results demonstrated no evidence of a difference 
      in efficacy (measured by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Total) and HRQoL (measured 
      by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Part C) outcomes between MRgFUS and unilateral 
      DBS in the short term (≤12 months). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary 
      evidence that MRgFUS could elicit similar short-term tremor- and HRQoL-related 
      benefits to DBS, the current standard of care, and allowed for the first robust 
      statistical comparison between these interventions.

TI  - Comparison of Methods to Generalize Randomized Clinical Trial Results Without 
      Individual-Level Data for the Target Population.
PG  - 426-437
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwy233 [doi]
AB  - Our study explored the application of methods to generalize randomized controlled 
      trial results to a target population without individual-level data. We compared 4 
      methods using aggregate data for the target population to generalize results from 
      the international trial, Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an 
      Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), to a target population of 
      trial-eligible patients in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The 
      gold-standard method used individual data from both the trial and CPRD to predict 
      probabilities of being sampled in the trial and to reweight trial participants to 
      reflect CPRD patient characteristics. Methods 1 and 2 used weighting methods based 
      on simulated individual data or the method of moments, respectively. Method 3 
      weighted the trial's subgroup-specific treatment effects to match the distribution 
      of an effect modifier in CPRD. Method 4 calculated the expected absolute benefits in 
      CPRD assuming homogeneous relative treatment effect. Methods based on aggregate data 
      for the target population generally yielded results between the trial and 
      gold-standard estimates. Methods 1 and 2 yielded estimates closest to the 
      gold-standard estimates when continuous effect modifiers were represented as 
      categorical variables. Although individual data or data on joint distributions 
      remains the best approach to generalize trial results, these methods using aggregate 
      data might be useful tools for timely assessment of randomized trial 
      generalizability.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparison of benralizumab versus interleukin-5 
      inhibitors for the treatment of severe asthma: a systematic review.
LID - 10.1183/13993003.01393-2018 [doi]
LID - 1801393
AB  - Benralizumab is an interleukin-5 receptor α-directed cytolytic monoclonal antibody 
      that directly depletes eosinophils. Its relative efficacy versus other IL-5-targeted 
      treatments for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma is not yet fully 
      characterised.We performed a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of 
      benralizumab versus mepolizumab and reslizumab. Trials were selected through 
      systematic review and evaluation of trial methods. Benralizumab patient-level data 
      were weighted to match treatment-effect-modifying patient characteristics of 
      comparator trials before indirect efficacy comparisons.After matching adjustment, 
      benralizumab and mepolizumab reduced exacerbations versus placebo by 52% and 49%, 
      respectively (rate ratio [RR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.78-1.13; n=1524) and reduced the rate 
      of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation/emergency department visit by 52% and 
      52%, respectively (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.57-1.75; n=1524). Benralizumab and mepolizumab 
      similarly improved pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s at 32 weeks 
      (difference 0.03 L, 95% CI -0.06-0.12; n=1443). Benralizumab and reslizumab patient 
      populations were too dissimilar to generate a sufficient effective sample size to 
      produce a reliable estimate for MAIC.MAIC is a robust way to indirectly compare 
      treatment efficacies from trials with heterogeneous patient populations. When 
      baseline patient characteristics were matched across asthma trials, benralizumab and 
      mepolizumab yielded similar efficacy.

TI  - Long-term Survival and Value of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy for 
      Pediatric Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia.
PG  - 1161-1168
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.2530 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Among children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia, the rate of 5-year disease-free survival is 10% to 20%. 
      Approval of tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, represents 
      a new and potentially curative treatment option. However, tisagenlecleucel is 
      expensive, with a current list price of $475 000 per one-time administration. 
      OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term survival and value of tisagenlecleucel for 
      children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a decision analytic model was 
      designed to extrapolate trial evidence to a patient lifetime horizon. The survival 
      evidence for the model was extracted from 3 studies: B2202 (enrolled patients from 
      April 8, 2015, to November 23, 2016), B2205J (enrolled patients from August 14, 
      2014, to February 1, 2016), and B2101J (enrolled patients from March 15, 2012, to 
      November 30, 2015). Long-term survival and outcomes of patients younger than 25 
      years with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or 
      later relapse were derived using flexible parametric modeling from the direct 
      extrapolation of event-free survival and overall survival curves. The published 
      Kaplan-Meier curves were digitized from November 1, 2017, to November 30, 2017, 
      using an algorithm to impute patient-level time-to-event data. Sensitivity and 
      scenario analyses assessed uncertainty in the evidence and model assumptions to 
      further bound the range of cost-effectiveness. Data were analyzed from December 1, 
      2017, to March 31, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: The primary intervention of interest was 
      tisagenlecleucel. The comparator of interest was the chemoimmunotherapeutic agent 
      clofarabine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Model outcomes included life-years gained, 
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental costs per life-year and 
      QALY gained. RESULTS: Forty percent of patients initiating treatment with 
      tisagenlecleucel are expected to be long-term survivors, or alive and responding to 
      treatment after 5 years. Tisagenlecleucel had a total discounted cost of $667 000, 
      with discounted life-years gained of 10.34 years and 9.28 QALYs gained. The 
      clofarabine comparator had a total discounted cost of approximately $337 000, with 
      discounted life-years gained of 2.43 years and 2.10 QALYs gained. This difference 
      resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately $42 000 per 
      life-year gained and approximately $46 000 per QALY gained for tisagenlecleucel vs 
      clofarabine. These results were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Across 
      scenario analyses that included more conservative assumptions regarding long-term 
      relapse and survival, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $37 000 
      to $78 000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Tisagenlecleucel likely 
      provides gains in survival and seems to be priced in alignment with these benefits. 
      This study suggests that payers and innovators should develop novel payment models 
      that reduce the risk and uncertainty around long-term value and provide safeguards 
      to ensure high-value care.

      are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) have limited 
      treatment options and generally a poor prognosis. Pembrolizumab was recently 
      approved in the US for the treatment of such patients having demonstrated clinical 
      benefit and tolerability in relapsed/refractory cHL; however, the cost-effectiveness 
      of pembrolizumab in this population is currently unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      three-state Markov model (progression-free [PF], progressed disease, and death) was 
      developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab (200 mg) vs brentuximab 
      vedotin (BV; 1.8 mg/kg) in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL after ASCT who have 
      not received BV post-ASCT over a 20-year time horizon from a US payer perspective. 
      PF survival was modeled using a naïve indirect treatment comparison of data from 
      KEYNOTE-087 and the SG035-003 trial. Post-progression survival was modeled using 
      data from published literature. Costs (drug acquisition and administration, disease 
      management, subsequent treatment, and adverse events) and outcomes were discounted 
      at an annual rate of 3.0%. Uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness was assessed 
      via probabilistic, deterministic, and scenario analyses. RESULTS: In the base case, 
      pembrolizumab was predicted to yield an additional 0.574 life-years (LYs) and 0.500 
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) vs BV and cost savings of $63,278. Drug 
      acquisition costs were the biggest driver of incremental costs between strategies. 
      Pembrolizumab had a 99.6% probability of being cost-effective compared with BV at a 
      willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000/QALY and dominated BV in all scenarios 
      tested. LIMITATIONS: The analysis was subject to potential bias due to the use of a 
      naïve indirect treatment comparison and, given the current immaturity of OS in 
      KEYNOTE-087, PPS was assumed equivalent across both treatments. CONCLUSION: 
      Pembrolizumab is a cost-effective alternative to BV for patients with 
      relapsed/refractory cHL after ASCT.

TI  - Ceritinib for Untreated Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-Positive Advanced Non-Small-Cell 
      Lung Cancer: An Evidence Review Group Evaluation of a NICE Single Technology 
      Appraisal.
PG  - 645-654
LID - 10.1007/s40273-018-0720-8 [doi]
AB  - The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the company 
      that manufactures ceritinib (Zykadia(®), Novartis) to submit evidence on the 
      clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug, as a first-line treatment for adults 
      with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive (+) advanced non-small-cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC), as part of the Institute's single technology appraisal (STA) 
      process. The CRD (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) and CHE (Centre for Health 
      Economics) Technology Assessment Group at the University of York was commissioned to 
      act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the Company's 
      submission (CS), the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The evidence 
      submitted in support of ceritinib, as the first-line treatment in ALK+ advanced 
      NSCLC, was a phase III, international, multicentre, open-label randomised controlled 
      trial (RCT) comparing ceritinib with pemetrexed/cisplatin plus pemetrexed 
      maintenance therapy (chemotherapy [CT] group). The results indicated that ceritinib 
      prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with CT. The only comparator 
      considered in the CS was crizotinib. The evidence selected in support of crizotinib 
      was PROFILE 1014, an open-label RCT of crizotinib, compared with 
      pemetrexed/cisplatin CT (without maintenance therapy), in previously untreated 
      advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC. The design and population of PROFILE 1014 was 
      similar to that of ASCEND-4, though there were some differences between the trials. 
      The Company considered it not possible to perform an 'anchor-based' analysis of 
      first-line ceritinib and crizotinib, and presented a Matching-Adjusted Indirect 
      Comparison (MAIC) of ceritinib and crizotinib using only the ALK inhibitor arm of 
      ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. The indirect comparison suggests that ceritinib may be 
      more effective in prolonging PFS than crizotinib. The ERG agreed that an indirect 
      comparison using only the ALK inhibitor arm of the trials was the only option 
      available in the present assessment; however, a number of limitations and potential 
      bias were identified in this analysis. The Company's model estimated that ceritinib 
      was cost effective when compared with crizotinib. However, the ERG highlighted 
      several concerns with the Company's analysis; the ERG's preferred base case 
      estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £69,255 per quality-adjusted 
      life-year (no patient access scheme [PAS] included). The ERG considered the economic 
      analysis to be sensitive to changes in assumption used, partly due to the due to the 
      immaturity of the overall survival data from trials, which leads to uncertainty 
      around the extrapolation used. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that ceritinib 
      is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for untreated ALK+ 
      advanced NSCLC in adults, if the Company provides it with the discount agreed in the 
      PAS.

TI  - Nivolumab for Treating Metastatic or Unresectable Urothelial Cancer: An Evidence 
      Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.
PG  - 655-667
LID - 10.1007/s40273-018-0723-5 [doi]
AB  - As part of its single technology appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute for 
      Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (Bristol-Myers Squibb) of 
      nivolumab (Opdivo(®)) to submit evidence of its clinical and cost effectiveness for 
      metastatic or unresectable urothelial cancer. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in 
      collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned to act as 
      the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG), which produced a detailed review of the 
      evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the 
      company's submission to NICE. Nivolumab was compared with docetaxel, paclitaxel, 
      best supportive care and retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin 
      plus gemcitabine, but only for patients whose disease has had an adequate response 
      in first-line treatment). Two ongoing, phase I/II, single-arm studies for nivolumab 
      were identified, but no studies directly compared nivolumab with any specified 
      comparator. Evidence from directly examining the single arms of the trial data 
      indicated little difference between the outcomes measured from the nivolumab and 
      comparator studies. A simulated treatment comparison (STC) analysis was used in an 
      attempt to reduce the bias induced by naïve comparison, but there was no clear 
      evidence that risk of bias was reduced. Multiple limitations in the STC were 
      identified and remained. The effect of an analysis based on different combinations 
      of covariates in the prediction model remains unknown. The ERG's concerns regarding 
      the economic analysis included the use of a non-established response-based survival 
      analysis method, which introduced additional uncertainty. The use of time-dependent 
      hazard ratios produced overfitting and was not represented in the probabilistic 
      sensitivity analysis. The use of a treatment stopping rule to cap treatment cost 
      left treatment effectiveness unaltered. A relevant comparator was excluded from the 
      base-case analysis. The revised ERG deterministic base-case incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios based on the company's Appraisal Consultation Document 
      response were £58,791, £78,869 and £62,352 per quality-adjusted life-year gained 
      versus paclitaxel, docetaxel and best supportive care, respectively. Nivolumab was 
      dominated by cisplatin plus gemcitabine in the ERG base case. Substantial 
      uncertainties about the relative treatment effectiveness comparing nivolumab against 
      all comparators remained. NICE did not recommend nivolumab, within its marketing 
      authorisation, as an option for treating locally advanced, unresectable or 
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had platinum-containing therapy, 
      and considered that nivolumab was not suitable for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of brigatinib versus ceritinib and alectinib in patients with 
      crizotinib-refractory anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small cell lung 
      cancer.
PG  - 569-576
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2018.1520696 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Brigatinib, ceritinib, and alectinib are approved to treat 
      crizotinib-refractory anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC), but no trial has compared them head-to-head. A matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted to estimate the relative efficacy of these 
      agents in the crizotinib-refractory setting. METHODS: MAIC is a propensity 
      score-type method that adjusts for differences in baseline characteristics between 
      trials to estimate relative efficacy. Analyses were based on patient-level data from 
      the ALTA trial for brigatinib and published summary-level trial data from ASCEND-1 
      and ASCEND-2 for ceritinib and NP28761 and NP28673 for alectinib. Objective response 
      rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 
      compared. RESULTS: After matching, all key baseline characteristics were balanced 
      between trials. Compared with ceritinib, brigatinib was associated with longer PFS 
      (ASCEND-1: median 15.7 vs 6.9 months, hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence 
      interval] = 0.38 [0.26-0.57]; ASCEND-2: median = 18.3 vs 7.2 months, HR = 0.33 
      [0.20-0.56]) and OS (ASCEND-1: not available; ASCEND-2: median 27.6 vs 14.9 months, 
      HR = 0.33 [0.17-0.63]). Versus alectinib, brigatinib was associated with longer PFS 
      (NP28761: median = 17.6 vs 8.2 months, HR = 0.56 [0.36-0.86]; NP28673: median = 17.6 
      vs 8.9 months, HR = 0.61 [0.40-0.93]); results for OS were inconclusive (NP28761: 
      median = 27.6 vs 22.7 months, HR = 0.70 [0.42-1.16]; NP28673: median = 27.6 vs 26.0 
      months, HR = 0.66 [0.39-1.09]). ORR was similar. CONCLUSION: In 
      crizotinib-refractory ALK + NSCLC patients, relative efficacy estimates suggest 
      brigatinib may have prolonged PFS and OS vs ceritinib and prolonged PFS vs 
      alectinib.

BTI - Pharmacoeconomic Review Report: Ozenoxacin 1% Cream (Ozanex): (Ferrer Internacional, 
      S.A.): Indication: The topical treatment of impetigo in patients aged two months and 
      older
AB  - Ozenoxacin 1% cream is a topical non-fluorinated quinolone antibiotic indicated for 
      the treatment of impetigo in patients aged two months or older. The recommended use 
      for ozenoxacin is the application of a thin layer of cream to affected areas twice 
      daily for five days. It is available in 10 g tubes at $17.78 per tube, or $1.78 per 
      gram. The manufacturer submitted a cost-utility analysis with a 14-day time horizon 
      — conducted from a Canadian public health care payer perspective — which compared 
      ozenoxacin to fusidic acid and mupirocin (the two topical antibiotics available in 
      Canada). The submitted model was in the form of a decision tree with patients 
      receiving a topical antibiotic treatment and subsequently experiencing cure or no 
      cure based on treatment efficacy. An indirect treatment comparison was used to 
      compare the treatment efficacy of ozenoxacin to fusidic acid, while a Cochrane 
      systematic review and CADTH Rapid Response were used to support the assumption of 
      equal efficacy between fusidic acid and mupirocin. The manufacturer reported that 
      ozenoxacin is less costly and is associated with greater quality-adjusted life-years 
      (QALYs) (dominant) compared with fusidic acid, and the incremental cost-utility 
      ratio (ICUR) compared with mupirocin was $55,792 per QALY.

TI  - A systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing azacitidine and decitabine 
      for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypomethylating agents (HMA), azacitidine, and decitabine are frequently 
      used in the management of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, there are no 
      clinical trials that have directly compared these agents. We conducted a systematic 
      review and indirectly compared the efficacy of azacitidine to decitabine in MDS. 
      METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of several databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus) through June 28, 2018, 
      without language or time restrictions. Studies were screened by two independent 
      reviewers, and differences were resolved by consensus. The fixed effect model and 
      adjusted indirect comparison methods were used to pool relative risks (RR) of major 
      outcomes of interest (mortality, response rate, quality of life, hematologic 
      improvement, hospitalization, leukemia transformation, transfusion independence). 
      RESULTS: Only four trials met the eligibility criteria. Two trials compared 
      azacitidine to the best supportive care (BSC) and included 549 patients, and the 
      other two compared decitabine to BSC and included 403 patients. The risk of bias was 
      unclear overall. Compared to BSC, azacitidine was significantly associated with 
      lower mortality (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.94, I(2) = 89%) whereas decitabine did not 
      significantly reduce mortality (RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.00, I(2) = 53%). Both drugs 
      were associated with higher partial and complete response compared to BSC. Indirect 
      comparisons were not statistically significant for all the studied outcomes, except 
      for complete response where azacitidine was less likely to induce complete response 
      compared to decitabine (RR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.01-0.86, very low-certainty evidence). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine and decitabine are both associated with improved outcomes 
      compared to BSC. The available indirect evidence comparing the two agents warrants 
      very low certainty and cannot reliably confirm the superiority of either agent. 
      Head-to-head trials are needed. In the meantime, the choice of agent should be 
      driven by patient preferences, adverse effects, drug availability, and cost.

TI  - Everolimus, lutetium-177 DOTATATE and sunitinib for advanced, unresectable or 
      metastatic neuroendocrine tumours with disease progression: a systematic review and 
      cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 1-326
LID - 10.3310/hta22490 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a group of heterogeneous cancers that 
      develop in cells in the diffuse neuroendocrine system. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the 
      clinical effectiveness of three interventions [everolimus (Afinitor(®); Novartis 
      International AG, Basel, Switzerland), lutetium-177 DOTATATE (177Lu-DOTATATE) 
      (Lutathera(®); Imaging Equipment Ltd, Radstock, UK) and sunitinib (Sutent(®); Pfizer 
      Inc., New York, NY, USA)] for treating unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease 
      progression and establish the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. DATA 
      SOURCES: The following databases were searched from inception to May 2016: MEDLINE, 
      MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily, Epub Ahead of 
      Print, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science. 
      REVIEW METHODS: We systematically reviewed the clinical effectiveness and 
      cost-effectiveness literature on everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib for 
      treating advanced, unresectable or metastatic progressive NETs. The following NET 
      locations were considered separately: pancreas, gastrointestinal (GI) tract and 
      lung, and GI tract (midgut only). We wrote a survival partition cohort-based 
      economic evaluation in Microsoft Excel(®) 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, 
      USA) from the UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. This comprised three 
      health states: (1) progression-free survival (PFS), (2) progressed disease and (3) 
      death. RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), RADIANT-3 [RAD001 in 
      Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Third Trial; pancreatic NETs (pNETs): everolimus vs. 
      best supportive care (BSC)], A6181111 (pNETs: sunitinib vs. BSC) and RADIANT-4 
      (RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Fourth Trial; GI and lung NETs: 
      everolimus vs. BSC), met the inclusion criteria for the clinical effectiveness 
      systematic review. The risk of bias was low. Although the NETTER-1 (Neuroendocrine 
      Tumors Therapy) RCT, of 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 mg of octreotide (Sandostatin(®), 
      Novartis) compared with 60 mg of octreotide, was excluded from the review, we 
      nonetheless present the results of this trial, as it informs our estimate of the 
      cost-effectiveness of 177Lu-DOTATATE. The pNETs trials consistently found that the 
      interventions improved PFS and overall survival (OS) compared with BSC. Our indirect 
      comparison found no significant difference in PFS between everolimus and sunitinib. 
      Estimates of OS gain were confounded because of high rates of treatment switching. 
      After adjustment, our indirect comparison suggested a lower, but non-significant, 
      hazard of death for sunitinib compared with everolimus. In GI and lung NETs, 
      everolimus significantly improved PFS compared with BSC and showed a non-significant 
      trend towards improved OS compared with BSC. Adverse events were more commonly 
      reported following treatment with targeted interventions than after treatment with 
      BSC. In the base case for pNETs, assuming list prices, we estimated incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for everolimus compared with BSC of £45,493 per 
      quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and for sunitinib compared with BSC of £20,717 per 
      QALY. These ICERs increased substantially without the adjustment for treatment 
      switching. For GI and lung NETs, we estimated an ICER for everolimus compared with 
      BSC of £44,557 per QALY. For GI (midgut) NETs, the ICERs were £199,233 per QALY for 
      everolimus compared with BSC and £62,158 per QALY for a scenario analysis comparing 
      177Lu-DOTATATE with BSC. We judge that no treatment meets the National Institute for 
      Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) end-of-life criteria, although we cannot rule 
      out that sunitinib in the A6181111 trial does. LIMITATIONS: A RCT with included 
      comparators was not identified for 177Lu-DOTATATE. The indirect treatment comparison 
      that our economic analysis was based on was of a simple Bucher type, unadjusted for 
      any differences in the baseline characteristics across the two trials. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Given NICE's current stated range of £20,000-30,000 per QALY for the 
      cost-effectiveness threshold, based on list prices, only sunitinib might be 
      considered good value for money in England and Wales. FUTURE WORK: Further analysis 
      of individual patient data from RADIANT-3 would allow assessment of the robustness 
      of our findings. The data were not made available to us by the company sponsoring 
      the trial. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42016041303.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Three anti-IL-5 pathway-directed therapies are approved for use in 
      patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA); however, no head-to-head comparison 
      data are available. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the efficacy of licensed doses 
      of mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab in patients with SEA, according to 
      baseline blood eosinophil counts. METHODS: This indirect treatment comparison (ITC) 
      used data from a Cochrane review and independent searches. Eligible studies were 
      randomized controlled trials in patients aged 12 years or greater with SEA. End 
      points included annualized rate of clinically significant exacerbations and change 
      from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire score and FEV(1). An ITC was performed 
      in patients with Asthma Control Questionnaire scores of 1.5 or greater and 
      stratified by baseline blood eosinophil count. RESULTS: Eleven studies were 
      included. All treatments significantly reduced the rate of clinically significant 
      exacerbations and improved asthma control versus placebo in all blood eosinophil 
      count subgroups. Mepolizumab reduced clinically significant exacerbations by 34% to 
      45% versus benralizumab across subgroups (rate ratio ≥400 cells/μL: 0.55 [95% CI, 
      0.35-0.87]; ≥300 cells/μL: 0.61 [95% CI, 0.37-0.99]; and ≥150 cells/μL: 0.66 [95% 
      CI, 0.49-0.89]; all P < .05) and by 45% versus reslizumab in the 400 cells/μL or 
      greater subgroup (rate ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.36-0.85]; P = .007). Asthma control 
      was significantly improved with mepolizumab versus benralizumab (all subgroups: 
      P < .05) and versus reslizumab in the 400 cells/μL or greater subgroup (P = .004). 
      Benralizumab significantly improved lung function versus reslizumab in the 
      400 cells/μL or greater subgroup (P = .025). CONCLUSIONS: This ITC of the licensed 
      doses suggests that mepolizumab was associated with significantly greater 
      improvements in clinically significant exacerbations and asthma control compared 
      with reslizumab or benralizumab in patients with similar blood eosinophil counts.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in the 1st line 
      treatment of non-squamous NSCLC in the US.
PG  - 1191-1205
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2018.1521416 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To describe cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus platinum and pemetrexed 
      chemotherapy in metastatic, non-squamous, NSCLC patients in the US. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A model is developed utilizing partitioned survival analysis to estimate 
      the cost-effectiveness of KEYNOTE-189 trial comparators pembrolizumab + chemotherapy 
      (carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed) vs chemotherapy alone. Clinical efficacy, 
      treatment utilization, health utility, and safety data are derived from the trial 
      and projected over 20 years. For extrapolating survival beyond the trial, a novel 
      SEER population-data approach is applied (primary analysis), with separate 
      estimation via traditional parametric extrapolation methods. Costs for drugs and 
      non-drug disease management are also incorporated. Based on an indirect treatment 
      comparison, cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs pembrolizumab 
      monotherapy is evaluated for patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) ≥ 50%. 
      RESULTS: In the full non-squamous population, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is 
      projected to increase life expectancy by 2.04 years vs chemotherapy (3.96 vs 1.92), 
      for an approximate doubling of life years. Resultant incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratios (ICERs) are $104,823/QALY and $87,242/life year. In patients with PD-L1 ≥ 50% 
      and 1-49%, life expectancy is more than doubled (4.53 vs 1.88 years) and (4.87 vs 
      2.01 years), with a 32% (2.60 vs 1.97 years) increase in PD-L1 < 1% patients. 
      Corresponding incremental costs/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are $103,402, 
      $66,837, and $183,529 for PD-L1 ≥ 50%, 1-49%, and <1% groups, respectively. Versus 
      pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 ≥ 50% patients, representing current standard of 
      care, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy increases life expectancy by 65% (4.53 vs 2.74 
      years) at an ICER of $147,365/QALY. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The addition of 
      pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is projected to extend life expectancy to a point not 
      previously seen in previously untreated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Although 
      ICERs vary by sub-group and comparator, results suggest pembrolizumab + chemotherapy 
      yields ICERs near, or in most cases, well below a 3-times US per capita GDP 
      threshold of $180,000/QALY, and may be a cost-effective first-line treatment for 
      metastatic non-squamous NSCLC patients.

TI  - Relative effectiveness of sunitinib versus everolimus in advanced pancreatic 
      neuroendocrine tumors: an updated matching-adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 947-958
LID - 10.2217/cer-2018-0020 [doi]
AB  - AIM: A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of sunitinib and everolimus has 
      been previously reported based on the RADIANT-3 everolimus trial. We performed an 
      analysis using updated overall survival (OS) data based on sunitinib's trial 
      (A6181111). METHODS: The MAIC matched on all baseline characteristics available from 
      both studies. An anchored MAIC was performed for progression-free survival (PFS); an 
      unanchored analysis was deemed more appropriate for OS due to crossover in both 
      trials. A hazard ratio for sunitinib versus everolimus was derived from adjusted 
      (weighted) sunitinib effects compared with the observed results for everolimus. 
      RESULTS: The adjusted hazard ratio for sunitinib versus everolimus was 0.85 
      (0.39-1.89) for PFS and 0.82 (0.53-1.27) for OS. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate 
      comparable PFS and OS with sunitinib and everolimus.

TI  - Azithromycin or erythromycin? Macrolides for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in 
      adults: A systematic review and adjusted indirect treatment comparison.

AB  - Non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by an 
      airway inflammatory response to bacterial pathogens. Frequent exacerbations have a 
      major influence on the quality of life. Macrolide antibiotics have not only 
      antibacterial but also immune-regulation effects. It is proved that macrolides have 
      a benefit in preventing exacerbations. However, it is still uncertain whether 
      azithromycin or erythromycin is more effective and safe. The purpose of this study 
      was to answer the following question: Which kind of macrolide antibiotic is more 
      effective and safe in preventing non-CF bronchiectasis exacerbation? We conducted a 
      systematic review to identify randomized clinical trials published up to May 2017 
      that reported on macrolides for non-CF bronchiectasis and an adjusted indirect 
      treatment comparison (AITC) between macrolides to evaluate their efficacy and 
      safety. The direct comparison meta-analysis found that macrolides decreased the rate 
      of exacerbation of non-CF bronchiectasis (risk ratio (RR) = 0.45; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.36-0.55) with heterogeneity ( I(2) = 63.7%, p = 0.064). The AITC 
      showed that azithromycin had a significantly lower bronchiectasis exacerbation rate 
      than erythromycin (RR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.403-0.947). Azithromycin increased the risk 
      of diarrhea and abnormal pain. This meta-analysis suggested that long-term treatment 
      with macrolides significantly reduced the incidence of non-CF bronchiectasis 
      exacerbation. Moreover, azithromycin is more efficient than roxithromycin and 
      erythromycin in preventing exacerbation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the best available evidence on the efficacy and tolerability 
      of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used to treat poststroke seizures and epilepsy. 
      METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and Opengrey.eu were searched 
      for RCTs of AEDs used to treat post-stroke epilepsy. The following outcomes were 
      considered: seizure freedom; occurrence of adverse effects (AEs); withdrawal for 
      AEs. The methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for 
      Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Adjusted indirect comparisons were made between 
      each AED using controlled-release carbamazepine (CR-CBZ) as common comparator. 
      RESULTS: Only 2 RCTs were included, one comparing levetiracetam (LEV) with CR-CBZ 
      and the other comparing lamotrigine (LTG) with CR-CBZ. No significant difference was 
      found in seizure freedom between either LEV or LTG and CR-CBZ. Occurrence of AEs 
      were lower for LEV and LTG than for CR-CBZ. Indirect comparisons showed no 
      difference between LEV and LTG for seizure freedom (OR 0.86; 95%CI: 0.15-4.89). 
      Occurrence of AEs was higher for LEV than for LTG (OR 6.87; 95%CI: 1.15-41.1). For 
      withdrawal rates due to AEs, we found a large width and asymmetrical distribution of 
      confidence intervals around the obtained OR of 10.8 (95% CI: 0.78-149.71). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Direct and indirect comparisons did not find a difference in seizure 
      freedom between the various AEDs, probably because of the small number of patients 
      included. LEV and LTG appears better tolerated than CR-CBZ and LEV seems associated 
      with more AEs than LTG. Further studies are required to provide robust evidence on 
      efficacy and tolerability of AEDs for treating poststroke epilepsy.

TI  - Benefits and risks of ponatinib versus bosutinib following treatment failure of two 
      prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid

PG  - 479-487
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2018.1510225 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Comparing the benefit-risk profiles of ponatinib vs. bosutinib in 
      third-line (3L) treatment of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) is 
      challenging because their pivotal trials lacked comparator arms. To characterize the 
      overall benefit-risk profile in 3L CP-CML patients treated with bosutinib vs. 
      ponatinib, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to compare 
      efficacy outcomes and treatment duration after adjusting for trial subjects' 
      baseline characteristics, and tolerability was assessed with an unadjusted 
      comparison of study-drug discontinuation. METHODS: The MAIC was performed using 
      published data from the pivotal bosutinib trial and the most recent 
      individual-patient-level data on file from the pivotal ponatinib trial. RESULTS: 
      Responses were more frequent and durable with ponatinib (n = 70 MAIC-adjusted) than 
      with bosutinib (n = 119) - complete cytogenetic response (CCyR): 61% vs. 26%; 
      Kaplan-Meier estimate of maintaining CCyR at 4 years: 89% vs. 54%. Median treatment 
      duration was longer with ponatinib than with bosutinib: 38.4 vs. 8.6 months. Only 9% 
      of ponatinib patients (n = 97 unadjusted) vs. 42% of bosutinib patients discontinued 
      due to death, disease progression or unsatisfactory response; 19% vs. 24% 
      discontinued due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these surrogate measures 
      of patient benefit-risk profiles, ponatinib appears to provide a net overall benefit 
      vs. bosutinib in 3L CP-CML.

TI  - Real-world vs. randomized trial outcomes in similar populations of 
      rivaroxaban-treated patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in ROCKET AF and 
      XANTUS.
PG  - 421-427
LID - 10.1093/europace/euy160 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Based on Phase III data, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are 
      recommended for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. To determine 
      whether trial outcomes translate into similar event rates in unselected patients, 
      this analysis compared outcomes from the real-world XANTUS study with those from the 
      Phase III ROCKET AF study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual patient data from 4020 
      XANTUS patients were re-weighted to match the proportion of selected baseline 
      characteristics in 7061 rivaroxaban-treated patients from ROCKET AF, using the 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) method. For the primary analysis, 
      CHADS2 scores and gender were selected as relevant variables. Adjusted annualized 
      incidence rates for XANTUS were calculated and compared with incidence rates from 
      ROCKET AF-the ratio of these rates ('MAIC ratio') was used as a relative effect 
      estimate. Rates of major bleeding [3.10%/year vs. 3.60%/year; MAIC ratio 0.86; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.67-1.12] and stroke/non-central nervous system systemic 
      embolism (1.54%/year vs. 1.70%/year; MAIC ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.62-1.32) were similar 
      between XANTUS and ROCKET AF. The rate of all-cause death was higher in XANTUS 
      (3.22%/year vs. 1.87%/year; MAIC ratio 1.72; 95% CI 1.31-2.27), but the rates of 
      vascular death were similar (1.83%/year vs. 1.53%/year; MAIC ratio 1.19; 95% CI 
      0.84-1.70). Sensitivity analyses weighted by different baseline characteristics 
      supported these results. CONCLUSION: The low rates of major bleeding and stroke in 
      XANTUS were consistent with results from ROCKET AF. All-cause death, but not 
      vascular death, was higher in XANTUS, as expected in an unselected real-world 
      population.

TI  - Pembrolizumab for Previously Treated Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer: An 
      Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.
PG  - 19-27
LID - 10.1007/s40273-018-0689-3 [doi]
AB  - Pembrolizumab is an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody licensed for 
      locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma after platinum-containing 
      chemotherapy. This summary presents the perspective of Warwick Evidence, the 
      Evidence Review Group (ERG) appointed by the National Institute of Health and Care 
      Excellence (NICE) for the single technology appraisal of pembrolizumab for this 
      indication. Pembrolizumab is manufactured by Merck, Sharp and Dohme (MSD). The major 
      source of clinical effectiveness was the KEYNOTE-045 trial, where 542 patients 
      received either pembrolizumab or clinician's choice of docetaxel, paclitaxel or 
      vinflunine as a second-line treatment. No indirect treatment comparison was 
      performed. The clinical effectiveness was assessed using hazard ratios for overall 
      survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
      population, together with the subpopulations positive for programmed cell death 1 
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (combined positive score [CPS] ≥ 1%) and strongly 
      positive for PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 10%). In the ITT population, OS improved with 
      pembrolizumab (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91) while PFS outcomes showed no difference 
      (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81-1.19). Pembrolizumab demonstrated a better safety profile than 
      its combined comparators, with fewer patients experiencing adverse events (60.9 vs 
      90.2%). Similar results were observed in populations expressing PD-L1. MSD estimated 
      the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab using a de novo partitioned survival model. 
      The model had three health states: pre-progression, post-progression and death, 
      where OS and PFS estimates excluded patients who received vinflunine. The largest 
      uncertainty was over the selection of the parametric models used to extrapolate OS 
      and PFS and the time point for when to begin their extrapolation. The company 
      preferences for extrapolation were not well supported and the ERG disagreed with 
      their selection for OS. Utility values were also contentious, with the company 
      preferring to use pooled time-to-death-based utilities pooled across treatment arms, 
      whilst the ERG preferred pooled progression-based utilities. The company preferred 
      to use data from patients receiving vinflunine when calculating the utility values, 
      which the ERG disagreed with as this is not recommended treatment within the UK. The 
      company assumed a lifetime treatment effect for their model; however, the lack of 
      evidence made it difficult to confidently provide a realistic estimate of treatment 
      effect duration. Various durations were explored (3, 5 and 10 years). The first 
      appraisal committee meeting concluded that pembrolizumab was not cost effective, 
      largely due to uncertainty in the OS and PFS extrapolations. The company's second 
      submission included an additional 4 months follow-up to survival data. The company 
      in this new submission maintained their original assumptions in their base-case 
      analysis, changing only the choice of parametric curve for PFS. This change resulted 
      in the OS and PFS curves intersecting at 6 years in the pembrolizumab arm, at which 
      point PFS identically followed OS. This resulted in no patients in the 
      post-progression health state beyond this time point, and therefore, the majority of 
      pembrolizumab's benefit came from pre-progression survival. Given the unclear PFS 
      benefit, the ERG found this implausible and maintained their original base-case 
      model assumptions. Considerable uncertainty remained over the specification of the 
      extrapolations and the duration of treatment effect. Based on a new-value 
      proposition submitted by the company, the appraisal committee concluded that 
      pembrolizumab had plausible potential to be cost effective. Pembrolizumab was 
      referred for funding through the Cancer Drugs Fund, so that further data could be 
      collected with the aim of diminishing the outstanding uncertainties pertaining to 
      its clinical effectiveness.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterise the early diffusion of indirect comparison meta-analytic 
      methods to study drugs. DESIGN: Systematic literature synthesis. DATA SOURCES: 
      Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. 
      STUDY SELECTION: English language papers that used indirect comparison meta-analytic 
      methods to study the efficacy or safety of three or more interventions, where at 
      least one was a drug. DATA EXTRACTION: The number of publications and authors was 
      plotted by year and type: methodological contribution, review or empirical 
      application. Author and methodological details were summarised for empirical 
      applications, and animated coauthorship networks were created to visualise 
      contributors by country and affiliation type (academia, industry, government or 
      other) over time. RESULTS: We identified 477 papers (74 methodological 
      contributions, 42 reviews and 361 empirical applications) by 1689 distinct authors 
      from 1997 to 2013. Prior to 2002, only three applications were published, with 
      contributions from the USA (n=2) and Canada (n=1). The number of applications 
      gradually increased annually with rapid uptake between 2011 and 2013 (n=254, 71%). 
      Early diffusion occurred primarily in Europe with the first application credited to 
      the UK in 2003. Application spread to other European countries in 2005, and may have 
      been supported by regulatory requirements for drug approval. By the end of 2013, 
      contributions included 49% credited to Europe (22% UK, 27% other), 37% credited to 
      North America (11% Canada, 26% USA) and 14% from other regions. CONCLUSION: Indirect 
      comparison meta-analytic methods are an important innovation for health research. 
      Although Canada and the USA were the first to apply these methods, Europe led their 
      diffusion. The increase in uptake of these methods may have been facilitated by 
      acceptance by regulatory agencies, which are calling for more comparative drug 
      effect data to assist in drug accessibility and reimbursement decisions.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of treatment options for plantar heel pain: a systematic 
      review with network meta-analysis.
PG  - 182-194
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2017-098998 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of current treatment options 
      for plantar heel pain (PHP). DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis 
      (NMA). DATA SOURCES: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, Cochrane Database, Web of 
      Science and WHO Clinical Trials Platform were searched from their inception until 
      January 2018. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with 
      PHP investigating common treatments (ie, corticosteroid injection, non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs, therapeutic exercise, orthoses and/or extracorporeal 
      shockwave therapy (ESWT)) compared with each other or a no treatment, placebo/sham 
      control. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted and checked for accuracy 
      and completeness by pairs of reviewers. Primary outcomes were pain and function. 
      Comparative treatment effects were analysed by random effects NMA in the short term, 
      medium term and long term. Relative ranking of treatments was assessed by surface 
      under the cumulative ranking probabilities (0-100 scale). RESULTS: Thirty-one RCTs 
      (total n=2450 patients) were included. There was no evidence of inconsistency 
      detected between direct and indirect treatment comparisons in the networks, but 
      sparse data led to frequently wide CIs. Available evidence does not suggest that any 
      of the commonly used treatments for the management of PHP are better than any other, 
      although corticosteroid injections, alone or in combination with exercise, and ESWT 
      were ranked most likely to be effective for the management of short-term, 
      medium-term and long-term pain or function; placebo/sham/control appeared least 
      likely to be effective; and exercise appeared to only be beneficial for long-term 
      pain or function. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is equivocal regarding which 
      treatment is the most effective for the management of PHP. Given limited 
      understanding of long-term effects, there is need for large, methodologically robust

TI  - The use of single armed observational data to closing the gap in otherwise 
      disconnected evidence networks: a network meta-analysis in multiple myeloma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows for the estimation of comparative 
      effectiveness of treatments that have not been studied in head-to-head trials; 
      however, relative treatment effects for all interventions can only be derived where 
      available evidence forms a connected network. Head-to-head evidence is limited in 
      many disease areas, regularly resulting in disconnected evidence structures where a 
      large number of treatments are available. This is also the case in the evidence of 
      treatments for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: Randomised 
      controlled trials (RCTs) identified in a systematic literature review form two 
      disconnected evidence networks. Standard Bayesian NMA models are fitted to obtain 
      estimates of relative effects within each network. Observational evidence was 
      identified to fill the evidence gap. Single armed trials are matched to act as each 
      other's control group based on a distance metric derived from covariate information. 
      Uncertainty resulting from including this evidence is incorporated by analysing the 
      space of possible matches. RESULTS: Twenty five randomised controlled trials form 
      two disconnected evidence networks; 12 single armed observational studies are 
      considered for bridging between the networks. Five matches are selected to bridge 
      between the networks. While significant variation in the ranking is observed, 
      daratumumab in combination with dexamethasone and either lenalidomide or bortezomib, 
      as well as triple therapy of carfilzomib, ixazomib and elozumatab, in combination 
      with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, show the highest effects on progression free 
      survival, on average. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis shows how observational data can be 
      used to fill gaps in the existing networks of RCT evidence; allowing for the 
      indirect comparison of a large number of treatments, which could not be compared 
      otherwise. Additional uncertainty is accounted for by scenario analyses reducing the 
      risk of over confidence in interpretation of results.

TI  - Comparative Efficacy of Treatments for Previously Treated Advanced or Metastatic 
      Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Network Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1035-1048
LID - 10.1007/s12325-018-0734-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Due to the rarity of BRAF V600E mutation, no randomized study has 
      compared the combination targeted therapy dabrafenib + trametinib with other 
      second-line treatments for advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC). A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to assess the comparative 
      efficacy of treatments among patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic 
      NSCLC. METHODS: Randomized trials of dabrafenib + trametinib, docetaxel, erlotinib, 
      nintedanib + docetaxel, nivolumab, pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, and best supportive 
      care as second-line or above treatments for advanced or metastatic NSCLC identified 
      in a systematic literature review were included in the NMA. Overall response rates 
      (ORRs) and disease control rates (DCRs) were compared using logit models; 
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared using 
      fractional polynomial hazards models. Dabrafenib + trametinib was linked into the 
      evidence network through a matching-adjusted indirect comparison versus nivolumab. 
      RESULTS: Ten trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the NMA. 
      Dabrafenib + trametinib, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab were associated with the 
      highest odds of achieving overall response (12.2, 1.2, and 0.7 times higher, 
      respectively, compared with docetaxel). Estimated DCR was higher for 
      dabrafenib + trametinib, nintedanib + docetaxel, and pemetrexed compared with other 
      treatments. Patients treated with dabrafenib + trametinib, nivolumab, and 
      pembrolizumab had the lowest hazards of disease progression or death during 
      follow-up (72, 61, and 29% lower hazard of progression at 6 months; 61, 48, and 46% 
      lower hazard of death at 1 year, respectively, compared with docetaxel). CONCLUSION: 
      Dabrafenib + trametinib, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab were associated with higher 
      ORR and prolonged PFS and OS compared with chemotherapy in previously treated 
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC. FUNDING: Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

TI  - Cardiovascular Safety of Empagliflozin Versus Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) 
      Inhibitors in Type 2 Diabetes: Systematic Literature Review and Indirect 
      Comparisons.
PG  - 1491-1500
LID - 10.1007/s13300-018-0456-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinical trials conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) 
      treated with glucose-lowering drugs and examining cardiovascular-related outcomes 
      have yielded mixed results. In this work, we aimed to assess the relative treatment 
      effects of empagliflozin versus sitagliptin and saxagliptin (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
      (DPP-4) inhibitors) on cardiovascular-related outcomes in patients with T2DM. 
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify clinical trials 
      assessing cardiovascular-related outcomes for sitagliptin-, saxagliptin-, and 
      empagliflozin-treated patients with T2DM. A network meta-analysis of indirect 
      treatment comparisons was conducted in a Bayesian framework. Hazard ratios (HR) and 
      95% credible intervals (CrI) were computed for six cardiovascular-related outcomes 
      to estimate the relative efficacies of these agents. RESULTS: Empagliflozin showed a 
      statistically significant superiority over saxagliptin (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.46-0.80) 
      and sitagliptin (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.46-0.79) to reduce the risk for 
      cardiovascular-related mortality. For all-cause mortality, empagliflozin showed a 
      statistically significant risk reduction compared to saxagliptin (HR 0.61; 95% CrI 
      0.49-0.76) and sitagliptin (HR 0.67; 95% CrI 0.54-0.83). A similar pattern was 
      observed in the risk reduction for hospitalization due to heart failure, where 
      empagliflozin was found to be statistically significantly superior to saxagliptin 
      (HR 0.51; 95% CrI 0.37-0.70) and sitagliptin (HR 0.65; 95% CrI 0.47-0.90). 
      Empagliflozin was not statistically significantly different to sitagliptin and 
      saxagliptin with regard to the risk of a composite endpoint composed of death, 
      stroke or myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: In this indirect comparison to the 
      DPP-4 inhibitors saxagliptin and sitagliptin, empagliflozin significantly lowered 
      the risk of cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause mortality and 
      hospitalizations due to heart failure. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of ribociclib and palbociclib in 
      HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer.
PG  - 1319-1327
LID - 10.2147/CMAR.S163478 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ribociclib (RIBO) and palbociclib (PALBO), combined with letrozole 
      (LET), have been evaluated as treatments for hormone receptor-positive, human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer in separate Phase 
      III randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but not head-to-head. Population 
      differences can lead to biased results by classical indirect treatment comparison 
      (ITC). Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) aims to correct these 
      differences. We compared RIBO and PALBO in hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal 
      growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer using MAIC. METHODS: 
      Patient-level data were available for RIBO (MONALEESA-2), while only published 
      summary data were available for PALBO (PALOMA-2). Weights were assigned to 
      MONALEESA-2 patient data such that mean baseline characteristics matched those 
      reported for PALOMA-2; the resulting matched cohort was used in comparisons. Limited 
      by the results reported in PALOMA-2, progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary 
      comparison. Cox regression models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios 
      (HRs) for PFS, before indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was performed with 95% 
      confidence intervals. An exploratory analysis was performed similarly for overall 
      survival using earlier PALBO data (PALOMA-1). Grade 3/4 adverse events were also 
      compared. RESULTS: Racial characteristics, prior chemotherapy setting, and the 
      extent of metastasis were the most imbalanced baseline characteristics. The 
      unadjusted PFS HRs were 0.556 (0.429, 0.721) for RIBO+LET versus LET alone and 0.580 
      (0.460, 0.720) for PALBO+LET versus LET alone. MAIC adjustment resulted in an HR of 
      0.524 (0.406, 0.676) for RIBO+LET versus LET. PFS ITC using unadjusted trial data 
      produced an HR of 0.959 (0.681, 1.350) for RIBO versus PALBO, or 0.904 (0.644, 
      1.268) with MAIC. Unadjusted overall survival HR of RIBO versus PALBO was 0.918 
      (0.492, 1.710); while exploratory MAIC was 0.839 (0.440, 1.598). ITC of grade 3/4 
      adverse events yielded a risk ratio of 0.806 (0.604, 1.076). CONCLUSION: MAIC was 
      performed for RIBO and PALBO in the absence of a head-to-head trial: though not 
      statistically significant, the results favored RIBO.

TI  - What is the optimal systemic treatment of men with metastatic, hormone-naive 
      prostate cancer? A STOPCAP systematic review and network meta-analysis.

LID - S0923-7534(19)34540-5 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our prior Systemic Treatment Options for Cancer of the Prostate 
      systematic reviews showed improved survival for men with metastatic hormone-naive 
      prostate cancer when abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone/prednisone (AAP) or 
      docetaxel (Doc), but not zoledronic acid (ZA), were added to androgen-deprivation 
      therapy (ADT). Trial evidence also suggests a benefit of combining celecoxib (Cel) 
      with ZA and ADT. To establish the optimal treatments, a network meta-analysis (NMA) 
      was carried out based on aggregate data (AD) from all available studies. METHODS: 
      Overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival data from completed Systemic 
      Treatment Options for Cancer of the Prostate reviews of Doc, ZA and AAP and from 
      recent trials of ZA and Cel contributed to this comprehensive AD-NMA. The primary 
      outcome was OS. Correlations between treatment comparisons within one multi-arm, 
      multi-stage trial were estimated from control-arm event counts. Network consistency 
      and a common heterogeneity variance were assumed. RESULTS: We identified 10 
      completed trials which had closed to recruitment, and one trial in which recruitment 
      was ongoing, as eligible for inclusion. Results are based on six trials including 
      6204 men (97% of men randomised in all completed trials). Network estimates of 
      effects on OS were consistent with reported comparisons with ADT alone for AAP 
      [hazard ration (HR) = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.71], Doc (HR = 0.77, 
      95% CI 0.68-0.87), ZA + Cel (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.97), ZA + Doc (HR = 0.79, 95% 
      CI 0.66-0.94), Cel (HR = 0.94 95% CI 0.75-1.17) and ZA (HR = 0.90 95% CI 0.79-1.03). 
      The effect of ZA + Cel is consistent with the additive effects of the individual 
      treatments. Results suggest that AAP has the highest probability of being the most 
      effective treatment both for OS (94% probability) and failure-free survival (100% 
      probability). Doc was the second-best treatment of OS (35% probability). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Uniquely, we have included all available results and appropriately 
      accounted for inclusion of multi-arm, multi-stage trials in this AD-NMA. Our results 
      support the use of AAP or Doc with ADT in men with metastatic hormone-naive prostate 
      cancer. AAP appears to be the most effective treatment, but it is not clear to what 
      extent and whether this is due to a true increased benefit with AAP or the variable 
      features of the individual trials. To fully account for patient variability across 
      trials, changes in prognosis or treatment effects over time and the potential impact 
      of treatment on progression, a network meta-analysis based on individual participant 
      data is in development.

TI  - Network meta-analysis: an introduction for pharmacists.
PG  - 942-947
LID - 10.1007/s11096-018-0656-2 [doi]
AB  - Network meta-analysis is a new tool used to summarize and compare studies for 
      multiple interventions, irrespective of whether these interventions have been 
      directly evaluated against each other. Network meta-analysis is quickly becoming the 
      standard in conducting therapeutic reviews and clinical guideline development. 
      However, little guidance is available to help pharmacists review network 
      meta-analysis studies in their practice. Major institutions such as the Cochrane 
      Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Canadian Agency for Drugs 
      and Technologies in Health, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
      Decision Support Unit have endorsed utilizing network meta-analysis to establish 
      therapeutic evidence and inform decision making. Our objective is to introduce this 
      novel technique to pharmacy practitioners, and highlight key assumptions behind 
      network meta-analysis studies.

TI  - Pembrolizumab versus the standard of care for relapsed and refractory classical 
      Hodgkin's lymphoma progressing after brentuximab vedotin: an indirect treatment 
      comparison.
PG  - 503-511
LID - 10.1080/17474086.2018.1475226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is significant unmet need among patients with relapsed and 
      refractory classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (RRcHL) who have failed multiple lines of 
      therapy, including brentuximab vedotin (BV). Pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint 
      inhibitor, is one possible treatment solution for this population. RESEARCH METHODS: 
      The objective of this study was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) with 
      standard of care (SOC) versus pembrolizumab in previously BV treated RRcHL patients. 
      A systematic literature review identified one observational study of SOC that was 
      suitable for comparison with KEYNOTE-087, the principal trial of pembrolizumab in 
      this population. Both naïve and population-adjusted (using outcomes regression) 
      pairwise indirect comparisons were conducted. The primary analysis included all 
      patients who had failed BV, with a secondary analysis conducted including only those 
      known to have failed BV that was part of definitive treatment. RESULTS: In the 
      primary analysis, SOC was inferior to pembrolizumab in both the unadjusted 
      comparison (HR 5.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.56-7.01]) and the adjusted 
      comparison (HR 6.35 [95% CI 4.04-9.98]). These HRs increased to 5.16 (95% CI 
      3.61-7.38) and 6.56 (95% CI 4.01-10.72), respectively, in the secondary analysis. 
      CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab offers a significant improvement in PFS compared to SOC in 
      this population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify challenges that affect the feasibility and rigor of economic 
      models in rare diseases and strategies that manufacturers have employed in health 
      technology assessment submissions to demonstrate the value of new orphan products 
      that have limited study data. METHODS: Targeted reviews of PubMed, the National 
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Highly Specialised Technologies 
      (HST), and the Scottish Medicines Consortium's (SMC's) ultra-orphan submissions were 
      performed. RESULTS: A total of 19 PubMed studies, 3 published NICE HSTs, and 11 
      ultra-orphan SMC submissions were eligible for inclusion. In rare diseases, a number 
      of different factors may affect the model's ability to comply with good practice 
      recommendations. Many products for the treatment of rare diseases have an incomplete 
      efficacy and safety profile at product launch. In addition, there is often limited 
      available natural history and epidemiology data. Information on the direct and 
      indirect cost burden of an orphan disease also may be limited, making it difficult 
      to estimate the potential economic benefit of treatment. These challenges can 
      prevent accurate estimation of a new product's benefits in relation to costs. 
      Approaches that can address such challenges include using patient and/or clinician 
      feedback to inform model assumptions; data from disease analogues; epidemiological 
      techniques, such as matching-adjusted indirect comparison; and long-term data 
      collection. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling in rare diseases is often challenging; however, a 
      number of approaches are available to support the development of model structures 
      and the collation of input parameters and to manage uncertainty.

AB  - Therapies for cancer have traditionally been assessed with metrics such as the 
      response rate, hazard ratio, or median survival. Such metrics have value in 
      measuring the outcomes of conventional therapies, but may not be the most 
      appropriate for new therapies. Immuno-oncology therapies offer a new approach to 
      treating cancer by stimulating patients' immune systems to fight cancer. The value 
      of these novel therapies has so far been assessed with traditional metrics, but the 
      different ways in which immuno-oncology therapies work can mean the full value is 
      not captured. Immuno-oncology therapies can produce longer survival times but this 
      effect can be delayed or even preceded by an apparent phase of progression, which 
      median survival or response rates may not reflect. This paper discusses a range of 
      traditional and alternative metrics and their benefits or disadvantages in measuring 
      the effects of immuno-oncology therapies, using examples of several novel drugs as 
      case studies.

AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy of intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) belimumab 
      plus standard therapy in patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus 
      erythematosus and high disease activity (HDA). PATIENTS & METHODS: An indirect 
      treatment comparison using patient-level data of patients with HDA from three 
      belimumab IV Phase III randomized controlled trials (BLISS-52 [BEL110751]; BLISS-76 
      [BEL110752]; Northeast Asia study [BEL113750]) and one belimumab SC randomized 
      controlled trial (BLISS-SC [BEL112341]). RESULTS: Similar efficacy results were 
      identified between the belimumab formulations and greater improvements in efficacy 
      endpoints were observed for both formulations compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: 
      This indirect treatment comparison provides further evidence of the efficacy of 
      belimumab IV and SC in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and HDA, compared 
      with standard therapy.

TI  - Efficacy of bendamustine and rituximab as first salvage treatment in chronic 
      lymphocytic leukemia and indirect comparison with ibrutinib: a GIMEMA, ERIC and UK 
      CLL FORUM study.
PG  - 1209-1217
LID - 10.3324/haematol.2018.189837 [doi]
AB  - We performed an observational study on the efficacy of ben-damustine and rituximab 
      (BR) as first salvage regimen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In an 
      intention-to-treat analysis including 237 patients, the median progression-free 
      survival (PFS) was 25 months. The presence of del(17p), unmutated IGHV and advanced 
      stage were associated with a shorter PFS at multivariate analysis. The median 
      time-to-next treatment was 31.3 months. Front-line treatment with a 
      chemoimmunotherapy regimen was the only predictive factor for a shorter time to next 
      treatment at multivariate analysis. The median overall survival (OS) was 74.5 
      months. Advanced disease stage (i.e. Rai stage III-IV or Binet stage C) and 
      resistant disease were the only parameters significantly associated with a shorter 
      OS. Grade 3-5 infections were recorded in 6.3% of patients. A matched-adjusted 
      indirect comparison with ibrutinib given second-line within Named Patient Programs 
      in the United Kingdom and in Italy was carried out with OS as objective end point. 
      When restricting the analysis to patients with intact 17p who had received 
      chemoimmunotherapy in first line, there was no difference in OS between patients 
      treated with ibrutinib (63% alive at 36 months) and patients treated with BR (74.4% 
      alive at 36 months). BR is an efficacious first salvage regimen in CLL in a 
      real-life population, including the elderly and unfit patients. BR and ibrutinib may 
      be equally effective in terms of OS when used as first salvage treatment in patients 
      without 17p deletion.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of prostate artery embolization for benign prostatic 
      hyperplasia: an observational study and propensity-matched comparison with 
      transurethral resection of the prostate (the UK-ROPE study).
PG  - 270-282
LID - 10.1111/bju.14249 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of prostate artery embolization (PAE) 
      for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia 
      (BPH) and to conduct an indirect comparison of PAE with transurethral resection of 
      the prostate (TURP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: As a joint initiative between the British 
      Society of Interventional Radiologists, the British Association of Urological 
      Surgeons and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, we conducted the 
      UK Register of Prostate Embolization (UK-ROPE) study, which recruited 305 patients 
      across 17 UK urological/interventional radiology centres, 216 of whom underwent PAE 
      and 89 of whom underwent TURP. The primary outcomes were International Prostate 
      Symptom Score (IPSS) improvement in the PAE group at 12 months post-procedure, and 
      complication data post-PAE. We also aimed to compare IPSS score improvements between 
      the PAE and TURP groups, using non-inferiority analysis on propensity-score-matched 
      patient pairs. The clinical results and urological measurements were performed at 
      clinical sites. IPSS and other questionnaire-based results were mailed by patients 
      directly to the trial unit managing the study. All data were uploaded centrally to 
      the UK-ROPE study database. RESULTS: The results showed that PAE was clinically 
      effective, producing a median 10-point IPSS improvement from baseline at 12 months 
      post-procedure. PAE did not appear to be as effective as TURP, which produced a 
      median 15-point IPSS score improvement at 12 months post-procedure. These findings 
      are further supported by the propensity score analysis, in which we formed 65 
      closely matched pairs of patients who underwent PAE and patients who underwent TURP. 
      In terms of IPSS and quality-of-life (QoL) improvement, there was no evidence of PAE 
      being non-inferior to TURP. Patients in the PAE group had a statistically 
      significant improvement in maximum urinary flow rate and prostate volume reduction 
      at 12 months post-procedure. PAE had a reoperation rate of 5% before 12 months and 
      15% after 12 months (20% total rate), and a low complication rate. Of 216 patients, 
      one had sepsis, one required a blood transfusion, four had local arterial dissection 
      and four had a groin haematoma. Two patients had non-target embolization that 
      presented as self-limiting penile ulcers. Additional patient-reported outcomes, pain 
      levels and return to normal activities were very encouraging for PAE. Seventy-one 
      percent of PAE cases were performed as outpatient or day cases. In contrast, 80% of 
      TURP cases required at least 1 night of hospital stay, and the majority required 2 
      nights. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that PAE provides a clinically and 
      statistically significant improvement in symptoms and QoL, although some of these 
      improvements were greater in the TURP arm. The safety profile and quicker return to 
      normal activities may be seen as highly beneficial by patients considering PAE as an 
      alternative treatment to TURP, with the concomitant advantages of reduced length of 
      hospital stay and need for admission after PAE. PAE is an advanced embolization 
      technique demanding a high level of expertise, and should be performed by 
      experienced interventional radiologists who have been trained and proctored 
      appropriately. The use of cone-beam computed tomography is encouraged to improve 
      operator confidence and minimize non-target embolizations. The place of PAE in the 
      care pathway is between that of drugs and surgery, allowing the clinician to tailor 
      treatment to individual patients' symptoms, requirements and anatomical variation.

TI  - Indirect treatment comparison of cabazitaxel for patients with metastatic 
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have been previously treated with a 
      docetaxel-containing regimen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to conduct an indirect treatment 
      comparison between cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide to determine the 
      clinical efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel relative to comparators in the treatment 
      of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who progress on 
      docetaxel-based therapies. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to 
      inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due 
      to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive 
      care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and 
      adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The 
      ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios 
      for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs); 
      uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian) 
      Intervals. RESULTS: Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were 
      relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly 
      different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83-1.28) or enzalutamide (HR = 
      0.88; 95% CI = 0.69-1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis. 
      Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01-10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 
      1.41-75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03-10.09) were more likely to 
      occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was 
      higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14-206.40). 
      Frequentist analyses produced similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity of clinical 
      studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results 
      must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results 
      from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. 
      As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and 
      patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and 
      real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the 
      beneficial effects of these therapies.

TI  - Vaginal progesterone is as effective as cervical cerclage to prevent preterm birth 
      in women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a short 
      cervix: updated indirect comparison meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An indirect comparison meta-analysis published in 2013 reported that 
      both vaginal progesterone and cerclage are equally efficacious for preventing 
      preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes in women with a singleton gestation, 
      previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a sonographic short cervix. The efficacy of 
      vaginal progesterone has been challenged after publication of the OPPTIMUM study. 
      However, this has been resolved by an individual patient-data meta-analysis (Am J 
      Obstet Gynecol. 2018;218:161-180). OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of vaginal 
      progesterone and cerclage in preventing preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes 
      in women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a 
      midtrimester sonographic short cervix. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and 
      CINAHL (from their inception to March 2018); Cochrane databases, bibliographies, and 
      conference proceedings. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials 
      comparing vaginal progesterone to placebo/no treatment or cerclage to no cerclage in 
      women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a 
      sonographic cervical length <25 mm. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Updated 
      systematic review and adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis of vaginal 
      progesterone vs cerclage using placebo/no cerclage as the common comparator. The 
      primary outcomes were preterm birth <35 weeks of gestation and perinatal mortality. 
      Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: 
      Five trials comparing vaginal progesterone vs placebo (265 women) and 5 comparing 
      cerclage vs no cerclage (504 women) were included. Vaginal progesterone, compared to 
      placebo, significantly reduced the risk of preterm birth <35 and <32 weeks of 
      gestation, composite perinatal morbidity/mortality, neonatal sepsis, composite 
      neonatal morbidity, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (RRs from 0.29 
      to 0.68). Cerclage, compared to no cerclage, significantly decreased the risk of 
      preterm birth <37, <35, <32, and <28 weeks of gestation, composite perinatal 
      morbidity/mortality, and birthweight <1500 g (RRs from 0.64 to 0.70). Adjusted 
      indirect comparison meta-analyses did not show statistically significant differences 
      between vaginal progesterone and cerclage in the reduction of preterm birth or 
      adverse perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSION: Vaginal progesterone and cerclage are 
      equally effective for preventing preterm birth and improving perinatal outcomes in 
      women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a 
      midtrimester sonographic short cervix. The choice of treatment will depend on 
      adverse events and cost-effectiveness of interventions and patient/physician's 
      preferences.

TI  - Antithrombotic therapy in patients receiving saphenous vein coronary artery bypass 
      grafts: a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - e019555
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019555 [doi]
LID - e019555
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The current evidence for the prevention of saphenous vein graft 
      failure (SVGF) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery consists of direct 
      head-to-head comparison of treatments (including placebo) in randomised-controlled 
      trials (RCTs) and observational studies. However, summarising the evidence using 
      traditional pairwise meta-analyses does not allow the inclusion of data from 
      treatments that have not been compared head to head. Exclusion of such comparisons 
      could impact the precision of pooled estimates in a meta-analysis. Hence, to address 
      the challenge of whether aspirin alone or in addition to another antithrombotic 
      agent is a more effective regimen to improve SVG patency, a network meta-analysis 
      (NMA) is necessary. The objectives of this study are to synthesise the available 
      evidence on antithrombotic agents (or their combination) and estimate the treatment 
      effects among direct and indirect treatment comparisons on SVGF and major adverse 
      cardiovascular events, and to generate a treatment ranking according to their 
      efficacy and safety outcomes. METHODS: We will perform a systematic review of RCTs 
      evaluating antithrombotic agents in patients undergoing CABG. A comprehensive 
      English literature search will be conducted using electronic databases and grey 
      literature resources to identify published and unpublished articles. Two individuals 
      will independently and in duplicate screen potential studies, assess the eligibility 
      of potential studies and extract data. Risk of bias and quality of evidence will 
      also be evaluated independently and in duplicate. We will investigate the data to 
      ensure its suitability for NMA, including adequacy of the outcome data and 
      transitivity of treatment effects. We plan to estimate the pooled direct, indirect 
      and the mixed effects for all antithrombotic agents using a NMA. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Due to the nature of the study, there are no ethical concerns nor 
      informed consent required. We anticipate that this NMA will be the first to 
      simultaneously assess the relative effects of multiple antithrombotic agents in 
      patients undergoing CABG. The results of this NMA will inform clinicians, patients 
      and guideline developers the best available evidence on comparative effects benefits 
      of antithrombotic agents after CABG while considering the side effect profile to 
      support future clinical decision-making. We will disseminate the results of our 
      systematic review and NMA through a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO REGISTRATION

TI  - A generalized pairwise modelling framework for network meta-analysis.
PG  - 187-194
LID - 10.1097/XEB.0000000000000140 [doi]
AB  - Indirect comparison methods are used to measure the effect of two treatments that 
      were each compared against a similar control group in a meta-analysis. The network 
      meta-analysis method extends this to multiple treatments which are assessed 
      simultaneously. Currently, there exist Bayesian and multivariate modelling 
      approaches to these analyses, but these are computationally intensive and rely on 
      assumptions that may not be valid in practice. Here we introduce a generalized 
      pairwise modelling (GPM) framework for network meta-analysis, so named as it is 
      based on the repeated application of adjusted indirect comparisons, also known as 
      the Bucher method. The validity of this method hinges on the sufficient similarity 
      of the common control node (transitivity), and for the application in the GPM 
      framework this requirement extends to all common nodes used to make an indirect 
      comparison estimate. Apart from the assumption of sufficient similarity, the GPM 
      framework assumes only standard arithmetic and statistical rules making it more 
      robust when compared with existing methods for network meta-analysis. A software 
      program (MetaXL; www.epigear.com) is available to run this framework, so it is 
      easily accessible to researchers.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets, alemtuzumab, and natalizumab in the 
      treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with high disease activity in 
      England.
PG  - 676-686
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2018.1461630 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Cladribine tablets were the first oral short-course treatment approved for 
      highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). The Association of British 
      Neurologists guidelines currently recommend two infusion therapies, alemtuzumab and 
      natalizumab, to treat high disease activity relapsing remitting MS (HDA-RRMS). This 
      analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets in HDA-RRMS compared 
      with alemtuzumab and natalizumab, from the perspective of the National Health 
      Service (NHS) in England. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model with 11 
      health states (10 Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] plus death) was developed. 
      Transition matrices from the British Columbia registry were used to model the 
      natural history of EDSS. The treatment effect on EDSS was modelled using hazard 
      ratios for 6-month confirmed disability progression from an indirect treatment 
      comparison (ITC). Relapses and drug-related adverse events were modeled via 
      annualized relapse rates and event probabilities, with associated costs and 
      quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. Utilities were derived from trials and the 
      literature, and costs from NHS and literature sources. Uncertainty was assessed via 
      probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Cladribine tablets 
      were dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) vs alemtuzumab and natalizumab 
      in pairwise comparisons, and the dominant strategy in fully incremental analyses. 
      Incremental cost was driven largely by drug acquisition and administration costs, 
      and incremental QALY gain largely by differences in delayed EDSS progression. 
      Cladribine tablets had a 93% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of 
      GBP 30,000 per QALY gained, and remained dominant across the scenario analyses 
      tested. The greatest influence on results was the treatment effect on disability 
      progression derived from the ITC. LIMITATIONS: Uncertainty over the efficacy of DMT 
      beyond trial durations. In line with other comparative effectiveness analyses, the 
      network meta-analysis informing this cost-effectiveness analysis was associated with 
      a degree of uncertainty. No treatment switching analyses were undertaken. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine tablets are a cost-effective alternative to alemtuzumab and 
      natalizumab in the treatment of HDA-RRMS from the perspective of the NHS in England.

TI  - Secukinumab Versus Adalimumab for Psoriatic Arthritis: Comparative Effectiveness up 
      to 48 Weeks Using a Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison.
PG  - 99-122
LID - 10.1007/s40744-018-0106-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Secukinumab and adalimumab are approved for adults with active 
      psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In the absence of direct randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT) data, matching-adjusted indirect comparison can estimate the comparative 
      effectiveness in anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naïve populations. METHODS: 
      Individual patient data from the FUTURE 2 RCT (secukinumab vs. placebo; N = 299) 
      were adjusted to match baseline characteristics of the ADEPT RCT (adalimumab vs. 
      placebo; N = 313). Logistic regression determined adjustment weights for age, body 
      weight, sex, race, methotrexate use, psoriasis affecting ≥ 3% of body surface area, 
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability 
      Index score, presence of dactylitis and enthesitis, and previous anti-TNF therapy. 
      Recalculated secukinumab outcomes were compared with adalimumab outcomes at weeks 12 
      (placebo-adjusted), 16, 24, and 48 (nonplacebo-adjusted). RESULTS: After matching, 
      the effective sample size for FUTURE 2 was 101. Week 12 American College of 
      Rheumatology (ACR) response rates were not significantly different between 
      secukinumab and adalimumab. Week 16 ACR 20 and 50 response rates were higher for 
      secukinumab 150 mg than for adalimumab (P = 0.017, P = 0.033), as was ACR 50 for 
      secukinumab 300 mg (P = 0.030). Week 24 ACR 20 and 50 were higher for secukinumab 
      150 mg than for adalimumab (P = 0.001, P = 0.019), as was ACR 20 for secukinumab 
      300 mg (P = 0.048). Week 48 ACR 20 was higher for secukinumab 150 and 300 mg than 
      for adalimumab (P = 0.002, P = 0.027), as was ACR 50 for secukinumab 300 mg 
      (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: In our analysis, patients with PsA receiving secukinumab 
      were more likely to achieve higher ACR responses through 1 year (weeks 16-48) than 
      those treated with adalimumab. Although informative, these observations rely on a 
      subgroup of patients from FUTURE 2 and thus should be considered interim until the 
      ongoing head-to-head RCT EXCEED can validate these findings. FUNDING: Novartis

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of hydromorphone for severe opioid use disorder: findings from 
      the SALOME randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 1264-1273
LID - 10.1111/add.14171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous research has found diacetylmorphine, delivered under 
      supervision, to be cost-effective in the treatment of severe opioid use disorder, 
      but diacetylmorphine is not available in many settings. The Study to Assess 
      Long-term Opioid Maintenance Effectiveness (SALOME) randomized controlled trial 
      provided evidence that injectable hydromorphone is non-inferior to diacetylmorphine. 
      The current study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of hydromorphone directly 
      with diacetylmorphine and indirectly with methadone maintenance treatment. DESIGN: A 
      within-trial analysis was conducted using the patient level data from the 6-month, 
      double-blind, non-inferiority SALOME trial. A life-time analysis extrapolated costs 
      and outcomes using a decision analytical cohort model. The model incorporated data 
      from a previous trial to include an indirect comparison to methadone maintenance. 
      SETTING: A supervised clinic in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A 
      total of 202 long-term street opioid injectors who had at least two attempts at 
      treatment, including one with methadone (or other substitution), were randomized to 
      hydromorphone (n = 100) or diacetylmorphine (n = 102). MEASUREMENTS: We measured the 
      utilization of drugs, visits to health professionals, hospitalizations, criminal 
      activity, mortality and quality of life. This enabled us to estimate incremental 
      costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness ratios from a 
      societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses considered different sources of evidence, 
      assumptions and perspectives. FINDINGS: The within-trial analysis found 
      hydromorphone provided similar QALYs to diacetylmorphine [0.377, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) = 0.361-0.393 versus 0.375, 95% CI = 0.357-0.391], but accumulated 
      marginally greater costs [$49 830 ($28 401-73 637) versus $34 320 ($21 780-55 998)]. 
      The life-time analysis suggested that both diacetylmorphine and hydromorphone 
      provide more benefits than methadone [8.4 (7.4-9.5) and 8.3 (7.2-9.5) versus 7.4 
      (6.5-8.3) QALYs] at lower cost [$1.01 million ($0.6-1.59 million) and $1.02 million 
      ($0.72-1.51 million) versus $1.15 million ($0.71-1.84 million)]. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with severe opioid use disorder enrolled into the SALOME trial, injectable 
      hydromorphone provided similar outcomes to injectable diacetylmorphine. Modelling 
      outcomes during a patient's life-time suggested that injectable hydromorphone might 
      provide greater benefit than methadone alone and may be cost-saving, with drug costs 
      being offset by costs saved from reduced involvement in criminal activity.

AB  - Aim: To determine the preferred methodologies of health technology assessment (HTA) 
      agencies across Europe, Canada and Australia to ascertain acceptance of indirect 
      treatment comparisons (ITC) as a source of comparative evidence. Method: A review of 
      official submission guidelines and analysis of comments in HTA submissions that have 
      used different ITC methodologies. Conclusion: ITC is generally accepted as a 
      technique that allows demonstration of noninferiority to a comparator provided the 
      chosen methodology and underlying assumptions are clear and justified. However, HTA 
      agencies are more likely to closely scrutinize submitted data and evaluate 
      statistical significance of results when superiority is claimed. In addition, the 
      HTA agencies in scope tended to be cautious and only accept ITC data as support for 
      similarity of treatments.

TI  - Non-herbal tea consumption and ovarian cancer risk: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of observational epidemiologic studies with indirect comparison and 
      dose-response analysis.
PG  - 808-818
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgy048 [doi]
AB  - Ovarian cancer (OC) accounts for 4% of female malignancies worldwide, and its 
      prognosis is unfavorable. Currently available epidemiologic data suggest that 
      non-herbal tea consumption may reduce OC risk, but these evidences are inconsistent. 
      A comprehensive literature search for observational epidemiologic studies reporting 
      associations between non-herbal tea consumption and OC risk was conducted in 
      electronic databases. A random-effects model was used to synthesize effect measures 
      in binary meta-analysis, and adjusted indirect comparison was used to compare 
      whether there was a difference in effects between green tea (GT) and black tea (BT). 
      Both linear and non-linear models were used to explore the dose-response 
      relationship. Fourteen studies were included, and we obtained an inverse and 
      significant pooled estimate in binary meta-analysis [risk ratio (RR)pool = 0.76, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.95, PCochran < 0.001, I2 = 81.5%]. No publication 
      bias was identified in binary meta-analysis. In binary meta-analysis stratified by 
      tea types, we observed a significant association for GT (RRpool = 0.64, 95% CI 
      0.45-0.90, PCochran = 0.071, I2 = 53.6%), but not BT (RRpool = 0.85, 95% CI 
      0.65-1.12, PCochran = 0.007, I2 = 65.9%). Indirect comparison, which treated BT as 
      the reference, showed an inverse but non-significant association (RRGT versus BT = 
      0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.15). Both linear and non-linear models found that OC risk 
      decreased as the consumption levels of total non-herbal tea increased. However, the 
      dose-response relationship was stronger for GT when compared with BT. Our results 
      suggest that non-herbal tea, especially GT, is associated with a reduced risk of OC. 
      Future studies should explore biochemical evidence regarding the variation in 
      chemopreventive effects between different types of non-herbal tea.

TI  - Progression of Adjacent-level Degeneration After Lumbar Total Disc Replacement: 
      Results of a Post-hoc Analysis of Patients With Available Radiographs From a 
      Prospective Study With 5-year Follow-up.
PG  - 1395-1400
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000002647 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Post-hoc analysis of 5-year follow-up data from a randomized, 
      multicenter trial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence 
      of progression in radiographic adjacent-level degeneration (ΔALD) from preoperative 
      assessment to 5 years after total disc replacement (TDR) and the relationship of 
      these changes with range of motion and clinical adjacent-level disease. A secondary 
      objective was to compare adjacent-level degeneration (ALD) outcomes between TDR and 
      fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Fusion is associated with high rates of ALD in 
      symptomatic lumbar disc degeneration. TDR may reduce this risk. METHODS: In total, 
      175 patients with single-level, symptomatic, lumbar disc degeneration who had 
      received activL or ProDisc-L and had a preoperative and 5-year postoperative 
      radiograph available were included. Over 5-year follow-up, ΔALD was defined as an 
      increase in ALD of ≥1 grade and clinical ALD was defined as surgical treatment at 
      the level adjacent to an index TDR. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were 
      conducted to compare ALD outcomes after TDR (current trial) with those after fusion 
      (published trial). RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, 9.7% (17/175) of TDR patients had 
      ΔALD at the superior level. In patients with preoperative ALD at the superior level, 
      most (88% [23/26]) showed no radiographic progression over 5 years. The rate of 
      clinical ALD was 2.3% (4/175) and none of these patients had ALD at baseline. For 
      each degree of range of motion gained at the TDR level, there was a consistent 
      decrease in the percentage of patients with ΔALD. After matching and adjustment of 
      baseline characteristics, TDR had a significantly lower likelihood of ΔALD than 
      fusion (odds ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.13, 0.76). CONCLUSION: The rates 
      of ΔALD and clinical ALD in this TDR population were similar to those previously 
      reported in the literature for TDR at 5-year follow-up. TDR had a significantly 
      lower rate of ΔALD than fusion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

AB  - AIM: For dichotomous outcomes, odds ratio (OR) is one of the usual summary measures 
      of indirect treatment comparison. A corresponding number needed to treat (NNT) 
      estimate may facilitate understanding of the treatment effect. METHODS: We show how 
      to estimate NNT based on OR results of a matching adjusted indirect comparison. We 
      also have derived the explicit formula of its 95% CIs by applying the delta method, 
      and as an alternative, a simulation-based method. RESULTS: The method was applied in 
      a case study example in radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer 
      (RR-DTC) patients, comparing lenvatinib to sorafenib. For every two RR-DTC patients 
      treated with lenvatinib instead of sorafenib, one fewer would have progressed and 
      for every eight RR-DTC patients treated with lenvatinib instead of sorafenib, one 
      fewer would have died. CONCLUSION: Using NNT to summarize the results of a matching 
      adjusted indirect comparison can help the clinicians to better understand the 
      results in addition to OR.

TI  - The cost-effectiveness of nivolumab monotherapy for the treatment of advanced 
      melanoma patients in England.
PG  - 1163-1172
LID - 10.1007/s10198-018-0964-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nivolumab was the first programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) immune 
      checkpoint inhibitor to demonstrate long-term survival benefit in a clinical trial 
      setting for advanced melanoma patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost 
      effectiveness of nivolumab monotherapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma 
      patients in England. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to 
      estimate the lifetime costs and benefits of nivolumab versus ipilimumab and 
      dacarbazine for BRAF mutation-negative patients and versus ipilimumab, dabrafenib, 
      and vemurafenib for BRAF mutation-positive patients. Covariate-adjusted parametric 
      curves for time to progression, pre-progression survival, and post-progression 
      survival were fitted based on patient-level data from two trials and long-term 
      ipilimumab survival data. Indirect treatment comparisons between nivolumab, 
      ipilimumab, and dacarbazine were informed by these covariate-adjusted parametric 
      curves, controlling for differences in patient characteristics. Kaplan-Meier data 
      from the literature were digitised and used to fit progression-free and overall 
      survival curves for dabrafenib and vemurafenib. Patient utilities and resource use 
      data were based on trial data or the literature. Patients are assumed to receive 
      nivolumab until there is no further clinical benefit, assumed to be the first of 
      progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or 2 years of treatment. RESULTS: 
      Nivolumab is the most cost-effective treatment option in BRAF mutation-negative and 
      mutation-positive patients, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £24,483 
      and £17,362 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. The model results are most 
      sensitive to assumptions regarding treatment duration for nivolumab and the 
      parameters of the fitted parametric survival curves. CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab is a 
      cost-effective treatment for advanced melanoma patients in England.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Silver Delivery Approaches in the Management of 
      Partial-thickness Burns.
LID - WNDS20180223-3 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Burn injury is a common type of traumatic injury that causes 
      considerable morbidity and mortality, resulting in about 30,000 admissions annually 
      in specialist burn centers and costing around $1 billion per year in the United 
      States. One percent silver sulfadiazine has been utilized widely in the management 
      of burns and newer silver dressings are on the market, including nanocrystalline 
      silver dressings, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressings, and silver-impregnated 
      foam dressings. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the cost effectiveness of 
      the newer silver dressings using clinical data from an indirect treatment comparison 
      using silver sulfadiazine as the baseline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision 
      analytic model was developed from a US payer's perspective for burn patients with a 
      total body surface area of < 20%. Outcomes were length of stay, infections and 
      incidence of surgical procedures, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost. 
      RESULTS: The meta-analysis reported a statistically significant reduction in length 
      of hospital stay and clinically important reductions in infections and incidence of 
      surgical procedures in favor of the silver barrier dressing compared with other 
      silver dressings. The estimated QALYs were 0.970 versus 0.969 versus 0.969 and mean 
      cost per patient was $15,892, $23,799, and $24,269 for the nanocrystalline silver 
      dressing, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, and silver-impregnated foam 
      dressing, respectively. The analysis showed the nanocrystalline silver dressing to 
      be a dominant strategy (less costly with better outcomes). These findings were 
      robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: According to data from an 
      indirect treatment comparison, this analysis suggests that nanocrystalline silver 
      dressing is the most cost-effective silver delivery system. Prospective head-to-head 
      research on the costs and outcomes of these silver delivery systems in this patient 
      population is necessary to validate the results of this economic evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared mechanical 
      endovascular therapy (MET) in addition to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator 
      (IVtPA) to IVtPA alone for the management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Direct 
      comparative studies between individual METs are not available. In lieu of 
      head-to-head randomized control trials, we performed an adjusted indirect treatment 
      comparison (ITC) meta-analysis to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of 
      different METs, Solitaire+IVtPA and Penumbra+IVtPA in AIS patients. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      and Embase from January 1, 2005 through April 1, 2017 for RCTs in AIS patients, 
      comparing a single MET+IVtPA to IVtPA alone and reporting shift in ordinal modified 
      Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days. Secondary endpoints included 90 day mortality 
      and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). Endpoints were pooled using 
      traditional random effects meta-analysis methods, producing odds ratios and 95% 
      confidence intervals. Adjusted ITCs using pooled estimates were then performed. 
      Three studies (SWIFT PRIME, EXTEND-IA, THERAPY) were included; two evaluating the 
      Solitaire stent retriever and one the Penumbra system. Traditional meta-analysis 
      demonstrated that each MET+IVtPA resulted in increased odds of improving ordinal mRS 
      score vs. IVtPA alone, but did not alter the odds of death or sICH. Adjusted ITC 
      showed no significant difference between the METs for any outcome. CONCLUSION: No 
      significant difference in efficacy or safety between the Solitaire and Penumbra 
      devices was observed.

TI  - Methodological challenges in indirect treatment comparisons: spotlight on a recent 
      comparison of long-acting injectable aripiprazole versus paliperidone palmitate in 
      the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 213-216
LID - 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000215 [doi]
AB  - In a recent study, an indirect treatment comparison was performed to examine the 
      relative efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole once monthly and paliperidone 
      palmitate once monthly. The authors concluded that the results may suggest relative 
      advantages for aripiprazole once monthly over paliperidone palmitate once monthly in 
      the short-term treatment of schizophrenia. However, the validity of the study is 
      compromised as an indirect treatment comparison using extant data may violate 
      important assumptions. Other methodological issues identified further highlight the 
      challenges of performing indirect treatment comparisons.

TI  - Ponatinib for Treating Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia: An Evidence Review Group 
      Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.
PG  - 903-915
LID - 10.1007/s40273-018-0627-4 [doi]
AB  - As part of its single technology appraisal process, the National Institute for 
      Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the company that manufactures ponatinib 
      (Inclusig(®); Incyte Corporation) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost 
      effectiveness for previously treated chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and 
      Philadelphia-chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL). This paper 
      focusses on the three phases of CML: the chronic phase (CP), the accelerated phase 
      (AP) and the blast crisis phase (BP). The School of Health and Related Research 
      Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as 
      the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents the critical 
      review of the company's submission by the ERG and the outcome of the NICE guidance. 
      Clinical evidence for ponatinib was derived from a phase II, industry-sponsored, 
      single-arm, open-label, multicentre, non-comparative study. Despite the limited 
      evidence and potential for biases, this study demonstrated that ponatinib was likely 
      to be an effective treatment (in terms of major cytogenetic response and major 
      haematological response) with an acceptable safety profile for patients with CML. 
      Given the absence of any head-to-head studies comparing ponatinib with other 
      relevant comparators, the company undertook a matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
      (MAIC) of ponatinib with bosutinib. The approach was only used for patients with 
      CP-CML because comprehensive data were not available for the AP- or BP-CML groups to 
      allow the matching technique to be used. Despite the uncertainty about the MAIC 
      approach, ponatinib was considered likely to offer advantages over bosutinib in the 
      third-line setting, particularly for complete cytogenetic response. The company 
      developed two health economic models to assess the cost effectiveness of ponatinib 
      for the treatment of patients in CP-CML or in advanced CML (AP- or BP-CML, which 
      were modelled separately). The company did not adequately explore the uncertainty in 
      the survivor functions. As a result, the ERG believed the uncertainty in the 
      decision problem was underestimated. Exploratory analyses undertaken by the ERG 
      produced the following results for ponatinib. In CP-CML, from £18,246 to £27,667 per 
      quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with best supportive care (BSC), 
      from £19,680 to £37,381 per QALY gained compared with bosutinib and from £18,279 per 
      QALY gained to dominated compared with allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). 
      In AP-CML, the cost per QALY gained for ponatinib ranged from £7123 to £17,625 
      compared with BSC, and from dominating to £61,896 per QALY gained compared with 
      allo-SCT. In BP-CML, the cost effectiveness of ponatinib ranged from £5033 per QALY 
      gained to dominated compared with allo-SCT, although it was likely to be at the more 
      favourable end of this range, and dominant in all scenarios compared with BSC. The 
      NICE appraisal committee concluded that ponatinib is a cost-effective use of NHS 
      resources in the considered population, subject to the company providing the agreed 
      discount in the Patient Access Scheme.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of ceritinib in previously untreated anaplastic lymphoma 
      kinase-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in the United States.
PG  - 577-586
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2018.1443111 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of first-line ceritinib vs crizotinib and 
      platinum doublet chemotherapy for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive 
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from a US third-party payer's 
      perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health 
      states (stable disease, progressive disease, death) was developed over a 20-year 
      time horizon. Ceritinib's efficacy inputs (progression-free and overall survival) 
      were estimated from ASCEND-4; parametric survival models extrapolated data beyond 
      the trial period. The relative efficacy of ceritinib vs chemotherapy was obtained 
      from ASCEND-4, the relative efficacy of ceritinib vs crizotinib was estimated using 
      a matching-adjusted indirect comparison based on ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. Drug 
      acquisition, treatment administration, adverse event management, and medical costs 
      were obtained from publicly available databases and the literature, and inflated to 
      2016 US dollars. Treatment-specific stable-state utilities were derived from trials 
      and progressive-state utility from the literature. Incremental costs per 
      quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated for ceritinib vs each comparator. 
      Cost-effectiveness was assessed based on US willingness-to-pay thresholds. 
      Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test model 
      robustness. RESULTS: In the base case, first-line ceritinib was associated with 
      total direct costs of $299,777 and 3.28 QALYs (from 4.61 life years gained [LYG]) 
      over 20 years. First-line crizotinib and chemotherapy were associated with 2.73 and 
      2.41 QALYs, 3.92 and 3.53 LYG, and $263,172 and $228,184 total direct costs, 
      respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained was $66,064 for ceritinib vs 
      crizotinib and $81,645 for ceritinib vs chemotherapy. In the first 2 years following 
      treatment initiation, ceritinib dominated crizotinib by conferring greater health 
      benefits at reduced total costs. Results were robust to deterministic and 
      probabilistic sensitivity analyses. LIMITATIONS: In the absence of head-to-head 
      trials, an indirect comparison method was used. CONCLUSIONS: Ceritinib is 
      cost-effective compared to crizotinib and chemotherapy in the treatment of 
      previously untreated ALK-positive metastatic NCSLC in the US.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of liraglutide versus lixisenatide as add-on therapies to basal 
      insulin in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - e0191953
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0191953 [doi]
LID - e0191953
AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the glucagon-like peptide 1 
      receptor agonists liraglutide 1.8 mg and lixisenatide 20 μg (both added to basal 
      insulin) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Sweden. METHODS: The Swedish 
      Institute for Health Economics cohort model for T2D was used to compare liraglutide 
      and lixisenatide (both added to basal insulin), with a societal perspective and with 
      comparative treatment effects derived by indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Drug 
      prices were 2016 values, and all other costs 2015 values. The cost-effectiveness of 
      IDegLira (fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide) versus 
      lixisenatide plus basal insulin was also assessed, under different sets of 
      assumptions. RESULTS: From the ITC, decreases in HbA1c were -1.32% and -0.43% with 
      liraglutide and lixisenatide, respectively; decreases in BMI were -1.29 and -0.65 
      kg/m2, respectively. An estimated 2348 cases of retinopathy, 265 of neuropathy and 
      991 of nephropathy would be avoided with liraglutide compared with lixisenatide in a 
      cohort of 10,000 patients aged over 40 years. In the base-case analysis, total 
      direct costs were higher with liraglutide than lixisenatide, but costs associated 
      with complications were lower. The cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for 
      liraglutide added to basal insulin was SEK30,802. Base-case findings were robust in 
      sensitivity analyses, except when glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) differences for 
      liraglutide added to basal insulin were abolished, suggesting these benefits were 
      driving the cost/QALY. With liraglutide 1.2 mg instead of liraglutide 1.8 mg 
      (adjusted for efficacy and cost), liraglutide added to basal insulin was dominant 
      over lixisenatide 20μg.IDegLira was dominant versus lixisenatide plus basal insulin 
      when a defined daily dose was used in the model. CONCLUSIONS: The costs/QALY for 
      liraglutide, 1.8 or 1.2 mg, added to basal insulin, and for IDegLira (all compared 
      with lixisenatide 20 μg added to basal insulin) were below the threshold considered 
      low by Swedish authorities. In some scenarios, liraglutide and IDegLira were 
      cost-saving.

TI  - Evidence in support of hyperkalaemia management strategies: A systematic literature 
      review.
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.13052 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition that can be 
      managed with pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. With the recent 
      development of new hyperkalaemia treatments, new information on safe and effective 
      management of hyperkalaemia has emerged. OBJECTIVES: This systematic literature 
      review (SLR) aimed to identify all relevant comparative and non-comparative clinical 
      data on management of hyperkalaemia in adults. Our secondary aim was to assess the 
      feasibility of quantitatively comparing randomised controlled trial (RCT) data on 
      the novel treatment sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS) and established 
      pharmacological treatments for the non-emergency management of hyperkalaemia, such 
      as the cation-exchangers sodium/calcium polystyrene sulphonate (SPS/CPS). METHODS: 
      MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched on 3(rd) April 2017, with 
      additional hand-searches of key congresses and previous SLRs. Articles were screened 
      by two independent reviewers. Eligible records reported interventional or 
      observational studies of pharmacological or non-pharmacological management of 
      hyperkalaemia in adults. RESULTS: Database searches identified 2,073 unique records. 
      Two hundred and one publications were included, reporting 30 RCTs, 29 interventional 
      non-RCTs and 43 observational studies. Interventions investigated in RCTs included 
      ZS (3), SPS/CPS (3), patiromer (4) and combinations of temporising agents (6 RCTs). 
      A robust and meaningful indirect treatment comparison between ZS and 
      long-established cation-binding agents (SPS/CPS) was infeasible because of 
      heterogeneity between studies (including time points and dosing) and small sample 
      size in SPS/CPS studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite hyperkalaemia being associated with 
      several chronic diseases, there is a paucity of high-quality randomised evidence on 
      long-established treatment options (SPS and CPS) and a limited evidence base for 
      hyperkalaemia management with these agents.

TI  - A systematic review of network meta-analyses for pharmacological treatment of common 
      mental disorders.
PG  - 7-11
LID - 10.1136/eb-2017-102718 [doi]
AB  - QUESTION: Network meta-analyses (NMAs) of treatment efficacy across different 
      pharmacological treatments help inform clinical decision-making, but their 
      methodological quality may vary a lot depending also on the quality of the included 
      primary studies. We therefore conducted a systematic review of NMAs of 
      pharmacological treatment for common mental disorders in order to assess the 
      methodological quality of these NMAs, and to relate study characteristics to the 
      rankings of efficacy and tolerability. STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: We searched 
      three databases for NMAs of pharmacological treatment used in major depression, 
      generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), post-traumatic 
      stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and specific 
      phobia.Studies were appraised using the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics 
      and Outcomes Research checklist of good research practices for 
      indirect-treatment-comparison and network-meta-analysis studies. FINDINGS: Twenty 
      NMAs were eligible for inclusion. The number of randomised controlled trials per NMA 
      ranged from 11 to 234, and included between 801 to more than 26 000 participants. 
      Overall, antidepressants were found to be efficacious and tolerable agents for 
      several disorders based on rankings (45%) or statistical significance (55%). The 
      majority of NMAs in this review adhered to guidelines by including a network diagram 
      (70%), assessing consistency (75%), making use of a random effects model (75%), 
      providing information on the model used to fit the data (75%) and adjusting for 
      covariates (75%). CONCLUSIONS: The 20 NMAs of depression and anxiety disorders, PTSD 
      and/or OCD included in this review demonstrate some methodological strengths in 
      comparison with the larger body of published NMAs for medical disorders, support 
      current treatment guidelines and help inform clinical decision-making.

TI  - Relative short-term efficacy and acceptability of agomelatine versus vortioxetine in 
      adult patients suffering from major depressive disorder.
LID - 10.1002/hup.2646 [doi]
AB  - Agomelatine and vortioxetine are antidepressants with different mechanisms of action 
      compared to other pharmaceutical treatment options. The objective of this present 
      analysis is to determine the relative efficacy and acceptability of agomelatine 
      (25-50 mg) compared to vortioxetine (10-15-20 mg) in adult patients with major 
      depressive disorder. We performed an adjusted indirect comparison using placebo as a 
      common control. The main outcomes were efficacy (response to treatment by 
      Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale/Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) and 
      acceptability (withdrawal rate for any reason or due to adverse events). 10 
      agomelatine and 11 vortioxetine studies were included in the analysis. For efficacy, 
      no difference was shown between agomelatine and vortioxetine (E[95% CI] = -0.03 
      [-0.12;0.05]). For acceptability, no significant difference was found between both 
      antidepressants. These findings substantiate current understanding that most 
      antidepressants are of similar average efficacy and tolerability. Such equivalent 
      therapeutic benefit of both compounds, measured by a quantitative clinical research 
      approach, has to be discussed with the knowledge of a qualitative estimation in 
      routine practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare outcomes between adalimumab and etanercept in the treatment 
      of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Study groups included patients 
      randomized to adalimumab or placebo (REVEAL and CHAMPION trials) and those 
      randomized to etanercept or placebo (M10-114 and M10-315 trials). Week 12 outcomes 
      were compared between patients receiving adalimumab and those receiving etanercept 
      after adjusting for cross-trial differences in patient characteristics using 
      propensity score weighting and after subtracting effects of placebo. Outcomes 
      included proportion of patients achieving 75% or more, 90% or more, and 100% 
      reductions from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75, PASI90, 
      PASI100, respectively), symptom resolution (pruritus = 0; psoriatic pain = 0), 
      lesion resolution (minimal scores for plaque signs erythema, desquamation, and 
      induration, and by body regions head, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs), absence 
      of skin-related quality-of-life impact (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] = 0), 
      "complete disease control" (patient's global assessment [PtGA] = 0), and adverse 
      events. RESULTS: After adjustment, baseline characteristics were balanced among 
      study groups (adalimumab = 875 vs. placebo = 427; etanercept = 260 vs. placebo = 
      130). Compared with etanercept, adalimumab was associated with significantly better 
      placebo-adjusted outcomes (PASI75: 62.3% vs. 42.6%; PASI90: 35.9% vs. 12.1%; 
      PASI100: 13.1% vs. 4.9%; pruritus: 24.7% vs. 13.0%; psoriatic pain: 27.4% vs. 8.7%; 
      DLQI: 27.7% vs. 11.7%; and PtGA: 16.4% vs. 10.6%; all P < 0.05), except for similar 
      rates of adverse events and head-specific lesion resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Compared 
      with etanercept, adalimumab treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was 
      associated with greater PASI reduction, higher rates of resolution of skin signs and 
      symptoms, and greater improvements in dermatological life quality.

TI  - Management of trauma pain in the emergency setting: low-dose methoxyflurane or 
      nitrous oxide? A systematic review and indirect treatment comparison.
PG  - 11-21
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S150600 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-dose methoxyflurane and nitrous oxide (N(2)O; 50:50 with oxygen) are 
      both self-administered, self-titrated, rapid-acting, nonnarcotic, and noninvasive 
      inhalational agents with similar onset times of pain relief. The aim of this review 
      was to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these analgesics 
      in emergency care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search and review 
      according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
      guidelines were performed using Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Library, several 
      clinical trial registers, and emergency-medicine conference material. RESULTS: 
      Although both compounds have been used for many years in emergency care, the search 
      found only a few controlled studies and no head-to-head trials performed in this 
      setting. Two double-blind, randomized studies comparing their respective study 
      medication (low-dose methoxyflurane or N(2)O) to placebo were identified that could 
      be compared in an indirect approach by using placebo as a bridging comparator. Both 
      agents provided rapid pain relief to trauma patients, with no significant 
      differences between them; both treatments were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: 
      Both low-dose methoxyflurane and N(2)O are suitable options for the pain treatment 
      of trauma patients in the emergency setting. Due to the ease of administration and 
      portability, inhaled low-dose methoxyflurane, however, may not only offer advantages 
      in emergency situations in remote or difficult-to-reach locations and mass-casualty 
      situations but also be of significant value in urban and rural environments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease for which some people have a 
      genetic predisposition. The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either 
      the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although 
      there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow 
      sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in 
      psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains 
      unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head to head, 
      which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the 
      efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents (acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric 
      acid esters, methotrexate), small molecules (apremilast, tofacitinib, ponesimod), 
      anti-TNF alpha (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab), anti-IL12/23 
      (ustekinumab), anti-IL17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab), anti-IL23 
      (guselkumab, tildrakizumab), and other biologics (alefacept, itolizumab) for 
      patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and to provide a ranking of these 
      treatments according to their efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the 
      following databases to December 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and 
      LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports. We checked the 
      reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant 
      RCTs. We searched the trial results databases of a number of pharmaceutical 
      companies and handsearched the conference proceedings of a number of dermatology 
      meetings. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic and 
      biological treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate to severe 
      plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed 
      with moderate to severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to 
      placebo or another active agent. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three groups of two 
      review authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of 
      bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network 
      meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to 
      their effectiveness (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score 
      (PASI) 90) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse effects). We assessed 
      the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes, 
      according to GRADE; we evaluated evidence as either very low, low, moderate, or 
      high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      included 109 studies in our review (39,882 randomised participants, 68% men, all 
      recruited from a hospital). The overall average age was 44 years; the overall mean 
      PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo 
      controlled (67%), 23% were head-to-head studies, and 10% were multi-armed studies 
      with both an active comparator and placebo. We have assessed all treatments listed 
      in the objectives (19 in total). In all, 86 trials were multicentric trials (two to 
      231 centres). All of the trials included in this review were limited to the 
      induction phase (assessment at less than 24 weeks after randomisation); in fact, all 
      trials included in the network meta-analysis were measured between 12 and 16 weeks 
      after randomisation. We assessed the majority of studies (48/109) as being at high 
      risk of bias; 38 were assessed as at an unclear risk, and 23, low risk.Network 
      meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (conventional 
      systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more 
      effective than placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90.In terms of reaching PASI 90, 
      the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were 
      significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic 
      agents. Small molecules were associated with a higher chance of reaching PASI 90 
      compared to conventional systemic agents.At drug level, in terms of reaching PASI 
      90, all of the anti-IL17 agents and guselkumab (an anti-IL23 drug) were 
      significantly more effective than the anti-TNF alpha agents infliximab, adalimumab, 
      and etanercept, but not certolizumab. Ustekinumab was superior to etanercept. No 
      clear difference was shown between infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept. Only one 
      trial assessed the efficacy of infliximab in this network; thus, these results have 
      to be interpreted with caution. Tofacitinib was significantly superior to 
      methotrexate, and no clear difference was shown between any of the other small 
      molecules versus conventional treatments.Network meta-analysis also showed that 
      ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab 
      outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90: the 
      most effective drug was ixekizumab (risk ratio (RR) 32.45, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 23.61 to 44.60; Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) = 94.3; 
      high-certainty evidence), followed by secukinumab (RR 26.55, 95% CI 20.32 to 34.69; 
      SUCRA = 86.5; high-certainty evidence), brodalumab (RR 25.45, 95% CI 18.74 to 34.57; 
      SUCRA = 84.3; moderate-certainty evidence), guselkumab (RR 21.03, 95% CI 14.56 to 
      30.38; SUCRA = 77; moderate-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 24.58, 95% CI 3.46 
      to 174.73; SUCRA = 75.7; moderate-certainty evidence), and ustekinumab (RR 19.91, 
      95% CI 15.11 to 26.23; SUCRA = 72.6; high-certainty evidence).We found no 
      significant difference between all of the interventions and the placebo regarding 
      the risk of serious adverse effects (SAEs): the relative ranking strongly suggested 
      that methotrexate was associated with the best safety profile regarding all of the 
      SAEs (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99; SUCRA = 90.7; moderate-certainty evidence), 
      followed by ciclosporin (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.10; SUCRA = 78.2; very 
      low-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.36; SUCRA = 70.9; 
      moderate-certainty evidence), infliximab (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.00; SUCRA = 
      64.4; very low-certainty evidence), alefacept (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.55; SUCRA = 
      62.6; low-certainty evidence), and fumaric acid esters (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.30 to 
      1.99; SUCRA = 57.7; very low-certainty evidence). Major adverse cardiac events, 
      serious infections, or malignancies were reported in both the placebo and 
      intervention groups. Nevertheless, the SAEs analyses were based on a very low number 
      of events with low to very low certainty for just over half of the treatment 
      estimates in total, moderate for the others. Thus, the results have to be considered 
      with caution.Considering both efficacy (PASI 90 outcome) and acceptability (SAEs 
      outcome), highly effective treatments also had more SAEs compared to the other 
      treatments, and ustekinumab, infliximab, and certolizumab appeared to have the 
      better trade-off between efficacy and acceptability.Regarding the other efficacy 
      outcomes, PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1, the results were very 
      similar to the results for PASI 90.Information on quality of life was often poorly 
      reported and was absent for a third of the interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics ixekizumab, secukinumab, 
      brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab are the best choices for 
      achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate to severe psoriasis on the basis of 
      moderate- to high-certainty evidence. At class level, the biologic treatments 
      anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more 
      effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents, too. This 
      NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured between 12 to 
      16 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficiently relevant for a chronic 
      disease. Moreover, low numbers of studies were found for some of the interventions, 
      and the young age (mean age of 44 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 
      at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice.Another 
      major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly reported 
      safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk 
      profile of treatments. Indeed, we found no significant difference in the assessed 
      interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs. Methotrexate appeared to have the best 
      safety profile, but as the evidence was of very low to moderate quality, we cannot 
      be sure of the ranking. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of 
      the treatments included in this review, it will be necessary to evaluate 
      non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies 
      as well.In terms of future research, randomised trials comparing directly active 
      agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is 
      established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between conventional systemic 
      and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, 
      anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials 
      should also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve 
      patients, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). 
      Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and 
      researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the 
      interventions and the comparative safety of different agents.

TI  - Adjusted Indirect Comparison Using Propensity Score Matching of Osimertinib to 
      Platinum-Based Doublet Chemotherapy in Patients with EGFRm T790M NSCLC Who Have 
      Progressed after EGFR-TKI.
PG  - 319-331
LID - 10.1007/s40261-017-0611-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: An adjusted indirect comparison was conducted to assess 
      efficacy outcomes, particularly overall survival (OS), of osimertinib versus 
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in patients with epidermal growth factor 
      receptor-mutated (EGFRm) T790M mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
      who had progressed following an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Analysis of 
      treatment effect from two separate trials had the potential to more accurately 
      estimate the magnitude of OS benefit due to absence of confounding due to treatment 
      switching from the control arm to the osimertinib arm of the ongoing randomized 
      control trial, AURA3. METHODS: Two non-randomized individual datasets were compared: 
      pooled patients from the AURA extension and AURA2 trials (osimertinib 80 mg, 
      n = 405, with a confirmed T790M mutation using tissue samples), and patients from 
      the control arm of the IMPRESS study (platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, n = 61, 
      with a confirmed T790M mutation using plasma circulating tumour DNA [ctDNA]). A 
      propensity score-based approach was used to account for differences in baseline 
      demographics and disease characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline 
      differences between the two groups, osimertinib demonstrated a statistically 
      significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus platinum-based 
      doublet chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.278, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.188-0.409, p < 0.0001; median PFS 10.9 vs. 5.3 months). Improvements were also 
      observed for objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) (ORR: 64.3 
      vs. 33.3%; odds ratio [OR] = 5.31, 95% CI 2.47-11.40, p < 0.001; DCR: 92.1 vs. 
      75.0%; OR = 4.72, 95% CI 1.92-11.58, p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained for 
      patients who received osimertinib as second-line treatment only. A statistically 
      significant improvement in OS was observed for the osimertinib group (HR = 0.412, 
      95% CI 0.273-0.622, p < 0.0001). Median OS for osimertinib was not reached. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this indirect comparison, osimertinib showed a statistically 
      significant improvement in efficacy outcomes versus platinum-based doublet 
      chemotherapy in patients with EGFRm T790M NSCLC who had progressed after EGFR-TKI 
      therapy.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Systemic Therapies for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A 
      Network Meta-Analysis of Phase III Trials.

AB  - AIM/BACKGROUND: After the introduction of sorafenib in the treatment of advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), different studies tried to evaluate whether other 
      systemic therapies can improve survival. To provide a comprehensive indirect 
      treatment comparison of efficacy and safety of novel drugs, a network meta-analysis 
      (NMA) of phase III randomized controlled trials was performed. METHODS: After 
      pertinent literature search up to November 1, 2016, 6 studies were eligible for the 
      analysis including 4,812 individual patients with advanced HCC: 2,454 received 
      sorafenib, 577 received brivanib, 530 received sunitinib, 514 received linifanib, 
      358 received sorafenib + erlotinib and 379 received placebo. Frequentist NMA was 
      used to compare treatments within a single analytical framework. RESULTS: NMA showed 
      that sorafenib alone, regardless of combination with erlotinib, and linifanib 
      provide a significant survival advantage over placebo (p < 0.05) but without any 
      significant difference between each other. Conversely, all regimens significantly 
      ameliorate progression-free survival versus placebo (p < 0.05). The rank order of 
      efficacy was: sorafenib ± erlotinib, linifanib, brivanib, sunitinib, and placebo. 
      Sorafenib ± erlotinib was the regimen with the fewest number of adverse events that 
      required discontinuation of treatment, whereas linifanib and brivanib resulted in 
      the most adverse events. The risk-benefit summary identified one cluster of 
      therapies with a similar balance between efficacy and safety which included 
      sorafenib alone or in combination with erlotinib, having, at the same time, the 
      highest efficacy and safety. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib remains the best systemic 
      treatment for advanced HCC; linifanib also resulted in survival advantages over 
      placebo but with a lower safety profile.

TI  - Systematic review with network meta-analysis: comparative assessment of tofacitinib 
      and biological therapies for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 454-465
LID - 10.1111/apt.14449 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological therapies have improved the care of patients with ulcerative 
      colitis (UC). Tofacitinib, an oral small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, is 
      potentially a new treatment option. AIM: To comparatively assess efficacy and harm 
      of tofacitinib and biologics (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and vedolizumab) in 
      adult patients not previously exposed to TNF antagonists. METHODS: We performed a 
      comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, clinical trial registries, 
      regulatory authorities' websites and major conference proceedings, through August 
      2017, to identify randomised, placebo-controlled or head-to-head trials assessing 
      tofacitinib or biologics as induction and/or maintenance therapy in 
      moderate-to-severe UC. Two reviewers independently extracted study data and 
      outcomes, and investigated each trial's risk-of-bias. We used conventional 
      meta-analysis to synthesise direct evidence, and network meta-analysis for adjusted 
      indirect treatment comparisons. RESULTS: Fifteen randomised, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trials (n = 3130) contributed data for induction: All treatments 
      are superior to placebo. Indirect treatment comparisons showed that infliximab is 
      better than adalimumab (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.36-2.98) and golimumab (1.67, 1.08-2.59) 
      in clinical response, better than adalimumab (2.10, 1.21-3.64) in clinical 
      remission, and better than adalimumab (1.87, 1.26-2.79) and golimumab (1.75, 
      1.13-2.73) in mucosal healing. No indirect comparisons between tofacitinib and 
      biologics reached statistical significance. Nine studies (n = 1776) contributed 
      maintenance data showing that all treatments have higher clinical efficacy than 
      placebo. Safety analyses indicated no increased rates of adverse events for the 
      treatments under evaluation (except for infliximab), while vedolizumab may have an 
      advantage regarding the occurrence of serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Tofacitinib and biologics are efficacious and safe for UC. Further high-quality 
      research is warranted to establish the best therapeutic option.

AB  - Here we discuss the report by Claassen and colleagues describing an indirect 
      treatment comparison between tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine for chorea in 
      Huntington's disease using individual patient data. We note the potential for 
      discrepancies in apparently statistically significant findings, due to the rank 
      reversal phenomenon. We provide some cautionary observations and suggestions 
      concerning the limitations of indirect comparisons and the low likelihood that good 
      quality evidence will become available to guide clinical decision comparing these 
      two agents.

AB  - PURPOSE: Eslicarbazepine (ESL), Lacosamide (LAC), Perampanel (PER) and Brivaracetam 
      (BRV), have recently been marketed as third-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 
      We conducted a meta-analysis to indirectly compare overall efficacy and tolerability 
      between third-generation AEDs in uncontrolled focal epilepsy. METHODS: We performed 
      an online database search using Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Online Library, and 
      Clinicaltrial.gov for all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that 
      investigated the therapeutic effects over a range of AED doses versus placebo. We 
      then compared clinical efficacy and tolerability between these newer AEDs using 
      Indirect Treatment Comparison software. RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs with a total of 7245 
      patients were included in our study. There were no significant differences in the 
      risk difference of 50% responder rates and seizure free rates between third 
      generation AEDs, regardless of dose. The risk of treatment emergent adverse events 
      was significantly higher with ESL and PER treatment compared to BRV at all doses 
      combined. Withdrawal rates due to adverse events were also significantly higher in 
      patients treated with the highest doses of LAC and PER versus BRV, while treatment 
      with ESL or LAC was related to higher withdrawal rates versus BRV when all doses 
      were combined. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggested there were no significant 
      differences in efficacy between third generation AEDs in uncontrolled focal 
      epilepsy. BRV may have the best tolerability profile. The other AEDs were associated 
      with a higher risk for intolerable adverse, especially when taken at a high doses. 
      The results from these indirect comparisons warrant further examination and 
      verification through future well-designed trials.

TI  - Comparative Efficacy of Daratumumab Monotherapy and Pomalidomide Plus Low-Dose 
      Dexamethasone in the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma: A Matching Adjusted Indirect 
      Comparison.
PG  - 279-287
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0103 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (a human CD38-directed monoclonal antibody) and pomalidomide 
      (an immunomodulatory drug) plus dexamethasone are both relatively new treatment 
      options for patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma. A matching adjusted 
      indirect comparison (MAIC) was used to compare absolute treatment effects of 
      daratumumab versus pomalidomide + low-dose dexamethasone (LoDex; 40 mg) on overall 
      survival (OS), while adjusting for differences between the trial populations. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAIC method reduces the risk of bias associated with 
      naïve indirect comparisons. Data from 148 patients receiving daratumumab (16 mg/kg), 
      pooled from the GEN501 and SIRIUS studies, were compared separately with data from 
      patients receiving pomalidomide + LoDex in the MM-003 and STRATUS studies. RESULTS: 
      The MAIC-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for OS of daratumumab versus 
      pomalidomide + LoDex was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.83; p = .0041) 
      for MM-003 and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.37-0.69; p < .0001) for STRATUS. The treatment 
      benefit was even more pronounced when the daratumumab population was restricted to 
      pomalidomide-naïve patients (MM-003: HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.66; p = .0017; 
      STRATUS: HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.79; p = .0082). An additional analysis indicated a 
      consistent trend of the OS benefit across subgroups based on M-protein level 
      reduction (≥50%, ≥25%, and <25%). CONCLUSION: The MAIC results suggest that 
      daratumumab improves OS compared with pomalidomide + LoDex in patients with heavily 
      pretreated multiple myeloma. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This matching adjusted 
      indirect comparison of clinical trial data from four studies analyzes the survival 
      outcomes of patients with heavily pretreated, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma 
      who received either daratumumab monotherapy or pomalidomide plus low-dose 
      dexamethasone. Using this method, daratumumab conferred a significant overall 
      survival benefit compared with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone. In the 
      absence of head-to-head trials, these indirect comparisons provide useful insights 
      to clinicians and reimbursement authorities around the relative efficacy of 
      treatments.

TI  - A Network Meta-Analysis of Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonist (LAMA) and Long-Acting 
      β(2)-Agonist (LABA) Combinations in COPD.
PG  - 297-316
LID - 10.1007/s41030-017-0048-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Comparative data on the efficacies of long-acting muscarinic 
      antagonist (LAMA) and long-acting β(2)-agonist (LABA) combinations for the treatment 
      of moderate-to-very-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are limited. 
      The aim of this Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) is to assess the relative 
      efficacies of available open combinations (delivered via separate inhalers) and 
      fixed-dose combinations (FDCs, delivered via a single inhaler). METHODS: We 
      conducted a systematic literature review with the aim of identifying randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) of ≥8-week duration in adults aged ≥40 years with COPD that 
      compared LAMA + LABA combinations with each other, with tiotropium (TIO), or with 
      placebo. Data on changes from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s 
      (FEV(1)) and on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, the 
      Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score, and rescue medication use at 12 and 
      24 weeks were extracted from these RCTs and analyzed using a NMA in a Bayesian 
      framework. RESULTS: Data from 44 RCTs were included in the NMA. All FDCs showed 
      improvements relative to placebo in terms of trough FEV(1), SGRQ total score, and 
      TDI focal score above clinically relevant thresholds, with the exception of 
      TIO/olodaterol and aclidinium/formoterol, both of which failed to show clinically 
      relevant improvements in SGRQ score at 24 weeks. All FDCs demonstrated reduced 
      rescue medication use versus placebo. Open combinations demonstrated improved 
      efficacy in all outcomes versus placebo, but these improvements did not consistently 
      exceed clinically relevant thresholds for SGRQ and TDI scores. All once-daily FDCs 
      showed improved efficacy versus TIO, but improvements were less consistently 
      observed versus TIO with open dual combinations and combinations containing 
      formoterol or salmeterol administered twice daily. Relative probabilities of 
      improvement between FDCs highlighted potential between-class differences for trough 
      FEV(1) but suggested little potential for differences in patient-reported outcomes. 
      CONCLUSION: LAMA + LABA combinations generally showed improved outcomes versus 
      placebo and TIO. FDCs appeared to perform better than open dual combinations. A 
      potential effectiveness gradient was observed between FDCs for objectively assessed 
      functional outcomes, although further prospective trials are required to confirm 
      these findings. FUNDING: GSK.

TI  - Pegylated Liposomal Irinotecan Hydrochloride Trihydrate for Treating Pancreatic 
      Cancer After Gemcitabine: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single 
      Technology Appraisal.
PG  - 289-299
LID - 10.1007/s40273-017-0592-3 [doi]
AB  - The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
      manufacturer (Shire Pharmaceuticals) of pegylated liposomal irinotecan hydrochloride 
      trihydrate (liposomal irinotecan) to submit clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence 
      for its use in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folic acid/leucovorin (LV) 
      for treating patients with pancreatic cancer following prior treatment with 
      gemcitabine as part of the institute's Single Technology Appraisal process. The 
      Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group at the University of Liverpool was 
      commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents a 
      summary of the company's evidence, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance 
      (TA440), issued on 26 April 2017. Clinical evidence for liposomal 
      irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus 5-FU/LV was derived from 236 patients with metastatic 
      pancreatic cancer in the multinational, open-label, randomised controlled NAPOLI-1 
      trial. Results from analyses of progression-free survival and overall survival 
      showed statistically significant improvements for patients treated with liposomal 
      irinotecan + 5-FU/LV compared with those treated with 5-FU/LV. However, 5-FU/LV 
      alone is rarely used in National Health Service clinical practice for patients with 
      metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with gemcitabine. The company, ERG 
      and Appraisal Committee (AC) all agreed that oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV is the most 
      commonly used treatment. Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV was compared with 5-FU/LV in two 
      trials identified by the company. However, the company and the ERG both considered 
      attempts to compare the efficacy of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV with 
      oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV to be methodologically flawed; not only was there 
      heterogeneity between trials and their populations but also the proportional hazards 
      assumption required to conduct a robust indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was 
      violated. Nonetheless, data derived from an ITC were used to inform the company's 
      economic model. Using the discounted patient access scheme price for liposomal 
      irinotecan + 5-FU/LV, the company reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
      (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of £54,412 for the comparison 
      with oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV. The ERG considered that the company's base-case 
      cost-effectiveness results for the comparison of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV 
      versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV were underestimates and should be interpreted with 
      extreme caution. Following implementation of a number of model amendments, the ERG's 
      modified exploratory ICER for the comparison of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV 
      versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV was £106,898 per QALY gained. The AC accepted the 
      majority of the ERG's amendments to the model, and also highlighted that the total 
      QALYs for oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV were lower than for 5-FU/LV in the company's model, 
      which the AC considered to be clinically implausible. The AC therefore considered 
      results from exploratory analyses, undertaken by the ERG, which included altering 
      the QALY difference between liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV 
      by ± 10%. These analyses resulted in ICERs for the comparison of liposomal 
      irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV of between £201,019 per QALY 
      gained to liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV being dominated by oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV. 
      Therefore, despite uncertainty around the clinical-effectiveness evidence and 
      cost-effectiveness results, the AC was confident that the ICER was in excess of 
      £50,000 per QALY gained. The final guidance issued by NICE is that liposomal 
      irinotecan + 5-FU/LV is not recommended within its marketing authorisation for 
      treating metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in adults whose disease has 
      progressed after gemcitabine-based therapy.

TI  - Adjusted comparison of daratumumab monotherapy versus real-world historical control 
      data from the Czech Republic in heavily pretreated and highly refractory multiple 
      myeloma patients.
PG  - 775-783
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2017.1410121 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We conducted an adjusted comparison of progression-free survival (PFS) 
      and overall survival (OS) for daratumumab monotherapy versus standard of care, as 
      observed in a real-world historical cohort of heavily pretreated multiple myeloma 
      patients from Czech Republic. METHODS: Using longitudinal chart data from the 
      Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies (RMG) of the Czech Myeloma Group, patient-level 
      data from the RMG was pooled with pivotal daratumumab monotherapy studies (GEN501 
      and SIRIUS; 16 mg/kg). RESULTS: From the RMG database, we identified 972 treatment 
      lines in 463 patients previously treated with both a proteasome inhibitor and an 
      immunomodulatory drug. Treatment initiation dates for RMG patients were between 
      March 2006 and March 2015. The most frequently used treatment regimens were 
      lenalidomide-based regimens (33.4%), chemotherapy (18.1%), bortezomib-based regimens 
      (13.6%), thalidomide-based regimens (8.0%), and bortezomib plus thalidomide (5.3%). 
      Few patients were treated with carfilzomib-based regimens (2.5%) and 
      pomalidomide-based regimens (2.4%). Median observed PFS for daratumumab and the RMG 
      cohort was 4.0 and 5.8 months (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.94-1.39), respectively, and unadjusted median OS was 20.1 and 11.9 
      months (unadjusted HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48-0.78), respectively. Statistical 
      adjustments for differences in baseline characteristics were made using 
      patient-level data. The adjusted HRs (95% CI) for PFS and OS for daratumumab versus 
      the RMG cohort were 0.79 (0.56-1.12; p = .192) and 0.33 (0.21-0.52; p < .001), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted comparisons between trial data and historical 
      cohorts can provide useful insights to clinicians and reimbursement decision makers 
      on relative treatment efficacies in the absence of head-to-head comparison studies 
      for daratumumab monotherapy.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparison of efficacy in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with ixekizumab vs. secukinumab.
PG  - 1064-1071
LID - 10.1111/bjd.16140 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Head-to-head randomized studies comparing ixekizumab and secukinumab in 
      the treatment of psoriasis are not available. OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy and 
      quality of life using matching-adjusted indirect comparisons for treatment with 
      ixekizumab vs. secukinumab. METHODS: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 
      improvement of at least 75%, 90% and 100% and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
      0/1 response rates for approved dosages of ixekizumab (160 mg at Week 0, then 80 mg 
      every two weeks for the first 12 weeks) and secukinumab (300 mg at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 
      and 4, then 300 mg every 4 weeks) treatment were compared using data from active 
      (etanercept and ustekinumab) and placebo-controlled studies. Comparisons were made 
      using the Bucher (BU) method and two modified versions of the Signorovitch (SG) 
      method (SG total and SG separate). Subsequently, results based on active treatment 
      common comparators were combined using generic inverse-variance meta-analysis. 
      RESULTS: In the meta-analysis of studies with active comparators, PASI 90 response 
      rates were 12·7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5·5-19·8, P = 0·0005], 10·0% (95% CI 
      2·1-18·0, P = 0·01) and 11·2% (95% CI 3·2-19·1, P = 0·006) higher and PASI 100 
      response rates were 11·7% (95% CI 5·9-17·5, P < 0·001), 12·7% (95% CI 6·0-19·4, 
      P < 0·001) and 13·1% (95% CI 6·3-19·9, P < 0·001) higher for ixekizumab compared 
      with secukinumab using BU, SG total and SG separate methods. PASI 75 results were 
      comparable when SG methods were used and favoured ixekizumab when the BU method was 
      used. Week 12 DLQI 0/1 response rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Ixekizumab had higher PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses at week 12 compared with 
      secukinumab using adjusted indirect comparisons.

TI  - An indirect treatment comparison of the efficacy of insulin degludec/liraglutide 
      (IDegLira) and insulin glargine/lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) in patients with type 2 
      diabetes uncontrolled on basal insulin.
PG  - 340-347
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2017.1409228 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To obtain estimates of the relative treatment effects between insulin 
      degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) and insulin glargine U100/lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) 
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) uncontrolled on basal insulin 
      therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from phase 3 trials providing evidence for 
      estimating the relative efficacy and safety of IDegLira vs iGlarLixi in patients 
      uncontrolled on basal insulin-only regimens were used in this analysis. Outcomes of 
      interest were changes in HbA(1c), body weight and insulin dose, and rate ratio of 
      hypoglycemia. The indirect comparison of the reported trial findings followed the 
      principles of Bucher et al. RESULTS: IDegLira was estimated to provide a 0.44 [95% 
      CI = 0.17-0.71] %-point reduction in HbA(1c) compared with iGlarLixi. Body weight 
      was reduced by 1.42 [95% CI = 0.35-2.50] kg with IDegLira compared with iGlarLixi. 
      Insulin dose was comparable between the two interventions. The rate of severe or 
      blood glucose-confirmed (self-measured plasma glucose [SMPG] ≤ 3.1 mmol/L) 
      hypoglycemia with IDegLira was approximately half that of iGlarLixi (rate 
      ratio = 0.51 [95% CI = 0.29-0.90]). However, using the American Diabetes Association 
      definition of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (SMPG ≤3.9 mmol/L) the rate was 
      comparable between the two treatments (rate ratio = 1.07 [95% CI = 0.90-1.28]). 
      LIMITATIONS: The assumptions made in the indirect comparison and differences between 
      the included trials in baseline HbA(1c) levels, previous use of sulfonylureas, 
      definitions of hypoglycemia, presence or absence of run-in period, the different 
      duration of the trials, and the cross-over design of one of the trials. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The results of this indirect treatment comparison demonstrate that, among patients 
      with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, treatment with IDegLira results in a 
      greater reduction of HbA(1c) and a greater reduction in body weight compared with 
      iGlarLixi at similar insulin doses.

TI  - Cost-utility analysis of life-long prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIIIFc vs 
      recombinant factor VIII for the management of severe hemophilia A in Sweden.
PG  - 318-325
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2017.1405816 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) is the standard of care for 
      severe hemophilia A in Sweden. The need for frequent injections with existing rFVIII 
      products may, however, result in poor adherence to prophylaxis, leading to increased 
      bleeding and long-term joint damage. Recombinant FVIIIFc (rFVIIIFc) is an extended 
      half-life fusion protein which can offer prolonged protection and reduced dosing 
      frequency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of 
      prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc in severe hemophilia A from the perspective of the Swedish 
      health system. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate lifetime costs and 
      benefits of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc vs rFVIII products. Clinical outcomes were 
      represented by annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and quality of life via disutility 
      applied to bleeding events and injection frequency. Costs included the cost of FVIII 
      for routine prophylaxis and bleed resolution. The pooled comparator was costed by 
      weighting the cost of individual products by their market share. RESULTS: In the 
      base case, rFVIIIFc was dominant vs the pooled comparator. Savings of SEK 9.0 
      million per patient resulted from lower factor consumption for prophylaxis and bleed 
      resolution. Fewer bleeds and reduced injection frequency yielded an estimated 0.59 
      quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were sensitive to drug dosage and 
      robust to variation in other parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
      suggested a greater than 85% probability of rFVIIIFc being cost-effective at a 
      willingness-to-pay threshold of 500,000 SEK/QALY. LIMITATIONS: Due to unavailibilty 
      of patient-level data, treatment benefit was based on a non-adjusted indirect 
      comparison. Dosing and treatment outcomes were assumed to persist over the model 
      duration in the absence of long-term outcome data. CONCLUSION: The results suggest 
      that rFVIIIFc may be a cost-effective option for hemophilia A prophylaxis, 
      generating greater quality of life and reduced costs for the Swedish payer compared 
      to more frequently administered rFVIII alternatives.

TI  - The Assessment for Disinvestment of Intramuscular Interferon Beta for 
      Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis in Brazil.
PG  - 161-173
LID - 10.1007/s40273-017-0579-0 [doi]
AB  - In Brazil, inclusion and exclusion of health technologies within the Unified Health 
      System (SUS) is the responsibility of the National Committee for Health Technology 
      Incorporation (CONITEC). A recent Cochrane systematic review demonstrated that 
      intramuscular interferon beta 1a (IFN-β-1a-IM) was inferior to the other beta 
      interferons (IFN-βs) for multiple sclerosis (MS). As a result, CONITEC commissioned 
      an analysis to review possible disinvestment within SUS. The objective of this paper 
      is to describe the disinvestment process for IFN-β-1a-IM in Brazil. The first 
      assessment comprised a literature review and mixed treatment comparison 
      meta-analysis. The outcome of interest was the proportion of relapse-free patients 
      in 2 years. This analysis confirmed the inferiority of IFN-β-1a-IM. Following this, 
      CONITEC recommended disinvestment, with the decision sent for public consultation. 
      More than 3000 contributions were made on CONITEC's webpage, most of them against 
      the preliminary decision. As a result, CONITEC commissioned a study to assess the 
      effectiveness of IFN-β-1a-IM among Brazilian patients in routine clinical care. The 
      second assessment involved an 11-year follow-up of a non-concurrent cohort of 12,154 
      MS patients developed by deterministic-probabilistic linkage of SUS administrative 
      databases. The real-world assessment further demonstrated that IFN-β-1a-IM users had 
      a statistically higher risk of treatment failure, defined as treatment switching or 
      relapse treatment or death, with the assessment showing that IFN-β-1a-IM was 
      inferior to the other IFN-βs and to glatiramer acetate in both direct and indirect 
      analysis. In the drug ranking with 40,000 simulations, IFN-β-1a-IM was the worst 
      option, with a success rate of only 152/40,000. Following this, CONITEC decided to 
      exclude the intramuscular presentation of IFN-β from the current MS treatment 
      guidelines, giving patients who are currently on this treatment the option of 
      continuing until treatment failure. In conclusion, we believe this is the first 
      example of this new disinvestment process in action, providing an exemplar for other 
      treatments in Brazil as well as other countries.

COIS- FUNDING: CCATES-UFMG received support from the Ministry of Health of Brazil through 
      resource transfer from the National Health Fund (TED 78/2015). NATS-INC received 
      support from the Ministry of Health of Brazil (BR/LOA 1500033.001). CONFLICT OF 
      INTEREST: KS, IRZ, VCCdS and CAP work directly for the Ministry of Health in Brazil. 
      However, all authors (LLPdeL, AAG Jnr, MS, CM, ID, KS, RGP, JA, BG, MB, IRZ, VCCdS, 
      CAP and FdeAA) declare they have no other relevant conflicts of interest. DATA 
      AVAILABILITY: The references used in the Cochrane review as well as our own analysis 
      are provided in this paper for researchers to access. Unfortunately, the SUS 
      database is owned by the Brazilian Government, with very tight controls of access. 
      No data can be analysed apart from by approved research institutions in Brazil, with 
      strict access criteria and controls. This is similar to accessing patient-level data 
      in other countries, such as Scotland and Sweden.

AB  - The study reports efficacy of Illicium verum essential oil (IvEO) against food borne 
      moudls and its nanoencapsulation for enhancing antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic 
      potency. Chemical characterization of the IvEO showed anethole (89.12%) as major 
      compound followed by estragole (4.859%). The IvEO showed broad fungitoxic spectrum 
      against common food borne moulds. It's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and 
      minimum aflatoxin B(1) inhibitory concentration (MAIC) against aflatoxigenic strain 
      Aspergillus flavus LHP-PV-1 were 0.7, and 0.5 μL/mL respectively. Morphological 
      observations of treatment sets by SEM and TEM along with decrease in ergosterol 
      content and enhanced leakage of Ca(2+), K(+) and Mg(2+) ions denoted fungal cell 
      membrane as site of action. The IvEO showed promising free radical scavenging 
      activity and favourable safety profile with high LD(50) value on mice. The IvEO also 
      exhibited considerable protection of Pistacia vera from fungal contamination and 
      complete protection from aflatoxin B(1) contamination in storage containers. 
      Nanoencapsulated IvEO in gel form and lyophilized form exhibited enhanced efficacy 
      as fungal inhibitor and aflatoxin suppressor. The chemically characterised IvEO may 
      be recommended as plant based preservative having favourable safety and its 
      nanocapsules may be of industrial significance as shelf life enhancer of food items. 
      This is the first report on in situ antiaflatoxigenic efficacy and nanoencapsulation 
      of IvEO.

TI  - Overcoming the Straw Man Effect in Oncology: Visualization and Ranking of 
      Chemotherapy Regimens Using an Information Theoretic Approach.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1200/CCI.17.00079 [doi]
LID - CCI.17.00079
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite the plethora of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data, most cancer 
      treatment recommendations are formulated by experts. Alternatively, network 
      meta-analysis (NMA) is one method of analyzing multiple indirect treatment 
      comparisons. However, NMA does not account for mixed end points or temporality. 
      Previously, we described a prototype information theoretical approach for the 
      construction of ranked chemotherapy treatment regimen networks. Here, we propose 
      modifications to overcome an apparent straw man effect, where the most studied 
      regimens were the most negatively valued. METHODS: RCTs from two scenarios-upfront 
      treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and relapsed/refractory multiple 
      myeloma-were assembled into ranked networks using an automated algorithm based on 
      effect sizes, statistical significance, surrogacy of end points, and time since RCT 
      publication. Vertex and edge color, transparency, and size were used to visually 
      analyze the network. This analysis led to the additional incorporation of value 
      propagation. RESULTS: A total of 18 regimens with 42 connections (chronic 
      myelogenous leukemia) and 28 regimens with 25 connections (relapsed/refractory 
      multiple myeloma) were analyzed. An initial negative correlation between vertex 
      value and size was ameliorated after value propagation, although not eliminated. 
      Updated rankings were in close agreement with published guidelines and NMAs. 
      CONCLUSION: Straw man effects can distort the comparative efficacy of newer regimens 
      at the expense of older regimens, which are often cheaper or less toxic. Using an 
      automated method, we ameliorated this effect and produced rankings consistent with 
      common practice and published guidelines in two distinct cancer settings. These 
      findings are likely to be generalizable and suggest a new means of ranking efficacy 
      in cancer trials.

TI  - Pomalidomide with Dexamethasone for Treating Relapsed and Refractory Multiple 
      Myeloma Previously Treated with Lenalidomide and Bortezomib: An Evidence Review 
      Group Perspective of an NICE Single Technology Appraisal.
PG  - 145-159
LID - 10.1007/s40273-017-0581-6 [doi]
AB  - The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as part of the 
      institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process, invited the manufacturer of 
      pomalidomide (POM; Imnovid(®), Celgene) to submit evidence regarding the clinical 
      and cost effectiveness of the drug in combination with dexamethasone (POM + LoDEX) 
      for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) after at least 
      two regimens including lenalidomide (LEN) and bortezomib (BOR). Kleijnen Systematic 
      Reviews Ltd (KSR) and Erasmus University Rotterdam were commissioned as the Evidence 
      Review Group (ERG) for this submission. The ERG reviewed the evidence submitted by 
      the manufacturer, validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model, and 
      conducted exploratory analyses in order to assess the robustness and validity of the 
      presented clinical and cost-effectiveness results. This paper describes the company 
      submission, the ERG assessment, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The company 
      conducted a systematic review to identify studies comparing POM with comparators 
      outlined in the NICE scope: panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone (PANO + 
      BOR + DEX), bendamustine with thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD) and conventional 
      chemotherapy (CC). The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from 
      MM-003, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing POM + LoDEX with high-dose 
      dexamethasone (HiDEX; used as a proxy for CC). Additional data from other studies 
      were also used as nonrandomized observational data sources for the indirect 
      treatment comparison of POM + LoDEX with BTD and PANO + BOR + DEX. Covariate or 
      treatment switching adjustment methods were used for each comparison. The model 
      developed in Microsoft(®) Excel 2010 using a semi-Markov partitioned survival 
      structure, submitted in the original submission to NICE for TA338, was adapted for 
      the present assessment of the cost effectiveness of POM + LoDEX. Updated evidence 
      from the clinical-effectiveness part was used for the survival modelling of 
      progression-free survival and overall survival. For POM + LoDEX, the patient access 
      scheme (PAS) discount was applied to the POM price. Three separate comparisons were 
      conducted for each comparator, each comparison using a different dataset and 
      adjustment methods. The ERG identified and corrected some errors, and the corrected 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for POM + LoDEX versus each comparator 
      were presented: approximately £45,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained 
      versus BTD, savings of approximately £143,000 per QALY lost versus PANO + BOR + DEX, 
      and approximately £49,000 per QALY gained versus CC. The ERG also conducted full 
      incremental analyses, which revealed that CC, POM + LoDEX and PANO + BOR + DEX were 
      on the cost-effectiveness frontier. The committee's decision on the technology under 
      analysis deemed that POM + LoDEX should be recommended as an option for treating 
      multiple myeloma in adults at third or subsequent relapse of treatments including 
      both LEN and BOR, contingent on the company providing POM with the discount agreed 
      in the PAS.

TI  - Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in medically ill patients: a mixed treatment 
      comparison meta-analysis.
PG  - 36-47
LID - 10.1007/s11239-017-1562-5 [doi]
AB  - The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend unfractionated heparin 
      (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) or fondaparinux for prevention of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
      embolism (PE), in medically-ill patients. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have 
      been evaluated relative to enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis though head-to-head 
      comparisons of these agents are lacking. Therefore, we conducted a mixed treatment 
      comparisons meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of established 
      treatments and DOACs for VTE prophylaxis in medically-ill patients. A comprehensive 
      literature search was conducted to identify randomized trials evaluating UFH, LMWHs 
      or DOACS for the prevention of VTE in medically ill patients. Articles were 
      retrieved and cross-referenced for additional trials, evaluated and entered into 
      ADDIS (version 1.16.6) to generate direct and indirect treatment comparisons for 
      VTE, DVT, PE, death from any cause, and bleeding. Ten articles were included and 
      eight anticoagulants were evaluated in a treatment network representing data on 
      28,382 patients. We found each treatment had similar efficacy in preventing VTE, 
      DVT, PE, death from any cause and each had similar risk of minor and major bleeding. 
      Overall, placebo was associated with more VTE and DVT events compared to LMWHs and 
      DOACs. We found that UFH, LMWHs and DOACs are comparable in preventing VTE, DVT, PE, 
      and death from any cause and in association with minor and major bleeding. 
      Anticoagulant selection for VTE prophylaxis in medically-ill patients should be 
      individualized by patient characteristics, risks and preferences along with specific 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations.

TI  - Comparison of Abiraterone Acetate and Docetaxel with Androgen Deprivation Therapy in 
      High-risk and Metastatic Hormone-naïve Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and 
      Network Meta-analysis.

AB  - CONTEXT: Randomized clinical trials have recently examined the benefit of adding 
      docetaxel or abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in hormone-naïve 
      advanced prostate cancer (PCa). OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and 
      network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, indirectly evaluating overall 
      survival (OS) for men treated with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone 
      with ADT (Abi-ADT) versus docetaxel with ADT (Doce-ADT) in hormone-naïve high-risk 
      and metastatic PCa. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, 
      and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched in August 2017. We pooled results 
      using the inverse variance technique and random-effects models. The Bucher technique 
      for indirect treatment comparison was used to compare Abi-ADT with Doce-ADT. A 
      priori subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: 
      Overall, 6067 patients from five trials were included: 1181 (19.5%) patients who 
      received Doce-ADT, 1557 (25.7%) patients who received Abi-ADT, and 3329 (54.9%) 
      patients who received ADT-alone. There was a total of 1921 deaths: 391 in the 
      Doce-ADT group, 353 in the Abi-ADT group, and 1177 in the ADT-only group. The pooled 
      hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63-0.91, 
      I(2)=51%, 3 trials, 2951 patients) for Doce-ADT versus ADT-alone and 0.63 (95% CI: 
      0.55-0.72, I(2)=0%, 2 trials, 3116 patients) for Abi-ADT versus ADT-alone. The 
      indirect comparison of Abi-ADT to Doce-ADT demonstrated no statistically significant 
      difference in OS between these approaches (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.67-1.06). Findings 
      were similar in various a priori subset analyses, including patients with metastatic 
      disease. Bayesian analyses demonstrated comparable results (HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 
      0.63-1.16). Despite the lack of statistical significance, Surface Under the 
      Cumulative Ranking Analysis demonstrated an 89% probability that Abi-ADT was 
      preferred. CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify a significant difference in OS between 
      Abi-ADT and Doce-ADT for men with hormone-naïve high-risk or metastatic PCa, 
      although Bayesian analysis demonstrates a high likelihood that Abi-ADT was 
      preferred. PATIENT SUMMARY: We synthesized the evidence available from studies 
      examining the administration of docetaxel or abiraterone in combination with 
      hormonal therapy for patients with newly diagnosed, advanced prostate cancer. While 
      these studies did not directly compare these agents, we used methodological 
      techniques to indirectly compare them and found no significant difference in overall 
      survival.

TI  - Resveratrol, pterostilbene, and baicalein: plant-derived anti-biofilm agents.
PG  - 261-272
LID - 10.1007/s12223-017-0549-0 [doi]
AB  - Microbial adhesion to surfaces and the subsequent biofilm formation may result in 
      contamination in food industry and in healthcare-associated infections and may 
      significantly affect postoperative care. Some plants produce substances with 
      antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that are able to inhibit the growth of 
      food-borne pathogens. The aim of our study was to evaluate antimicrobial and 
      anti-biofilm effect of baicalein, resveratrol, and pterostilbene on Candida 
      albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. 
      We determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), the minimum adhesion 
      inhibitory concentration (MAIC), and the minimum biofilm eradication concentration 
      (MBEC) by crystal violet and XTT determination. Resveratrol and pterostilbene have 
      been shown to inhibit the formation of biofilms as well as to disrupt preformed 
      biofilms. Our results suggest that resveratrol and pterostilbene appear potentially 
      very useful to control and inhibit biofilm contaminations by Candida albicans, 
      Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli in the food industry.

AB  - PURPOSE: Pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (POM-d), daratumumab monotherapy 
      (DARA), and carfilzomib monotherapy (CAR) have been approved for use in the 
      treatment of patients with heavily pretreated relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma 
      (RRMM) in the US, based on findings from the MM-002, SIRIUS, and PX-171-003-A1 
      studies, respectively. The objective of this study was to assess the 
      cost-effectiveness of POM-d, DARA, and CAR in this patient population from a US 
      payer's perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to estimate 
      the cost and health outcomes over a 3-year time horizon in 3 health states: 
      progression-free, post-progression, and death. The main efficacy data source was a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison using data from the aforementioned studies. 
      Direct medical costs were considered, including: treatment acquisition and 
      administration (initial line and subsequent line), pre- and post-medication, 
      prophylaxis treatment, adverse event management, and health care resource 
      utilization. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. A scenario analysis that assumed 
      equal efficacy across all 3 treatments was conducted. Costs, life-years, and 
      quality-adjusted life-years were estimated and discounted at 3% per annum. FINDINGS: 
      Over 3 years, the use of POM-d was associated with similar life-years and 
      quality-adjusted life-years gained compared with DARA and CAR (incremental: 
      life-years, +0.02 and +0.07, respectively; quality-adjusted life-years, +0.01 and 
      +0.05), and with a cost less than that of DARA (-$8,919) and similar to that of CAR 
      (-$195). Sensitivity analyses illustrated that the results were sensitive to 
      progression-free survival, treatment duration, and drug costs. An equal efficacy 
      scenario resulted in cost-savings relative to those of both DARA and CAR (-$11,779 
      and -$12,595). IMPLICATIONS: POM-d may be a cost-effective treatment option relative 
      to DARA or CAR in heavily pretreated patients with RRMM in the US.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tetrabenazine is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug 
      for Huntington's disease, and deutetrabenazine was recently tested against placebo. 
      A switching-trial from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine is underway, but no 
      head-to-head, blinded, randomized controlled trial is planned. Using meta-analytical 
      methodology, the authors compared these molecules. METHODS: RCTs comparing 
      tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine with placebo in Huntington's disease were 
      searched. The authors assessed the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, calculated indirect 
      treatment comparisons, and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
      Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. RESULTS: The evidence network for 
      this report comprised 1 tetrabenazine trial and 1 deutetrabenazine trial, both 
      against placebo. Risk of bias was moderate in both. Participants in the 
      tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine trials did not differ significantly on motor 
      scores or adverse events. Depression and somnolence scales significantly favored 
      deutetrabenazine. CONCLUSION: There is low-quality evidence that tetrabenazine and 
      deutetrabenazine do not differ in efficacy or safety. It is important to note that 
      these results are likely to remain the only head-to-head comparison between these 2 
      compounds in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Optimisation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for untreated Hodgkin lymphoma 
      patients with respect to second malignant neoplasms, overall and progression-free 
      survival: individual participant data analysis.
PG  - CD008814

AB  - BACKGROUND: Efficacy and the risk of severe late effects have to be well-balanced in 
      treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Late adverse effects include secondary 
      malignancies which often have a poor prognosis. To synthesise evidence on the risk 
      of secondary malignancies after current treatment approaches comprising chemotherapy 
      and/or radiotherapy, we performed a meta-analysis based on individual patient data 
      (IPD) from patients treated for newly diagnosed HL. OBJECTIVES: We investigated 
      several questions concerning possible changes in the risk of secondary malignancies 
      when modifying chemotherapy or radiotherapy (omission of radiotherapy, reduction of 
      the radiation field, reduction of the radiation dose, use of fewer chemotherapy 
      cycles, intensification of chemotherapy). We also analysed whether these 
      modifications affect progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL trials databases 
      comprehensively in June 2010 for all randomised trials in HL since 1984. Key 
      international trials registries were also searched. The search was updated in March 
      2015 without collecting further IPD (one further eligible study found) and again in 
      July 2017 (no further eligible studies). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised 
      controlled trials (RCTs) for untreated HL patients which enrolled at least 50 
      patients per arm, completed recruitment by 2007 and performed a treatment comparison 
      relevant to our objectives. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study groups submitted 
      IPD, including age, sex, stage and the outcomes secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN), 
      OS and PFS as time-to-event data. We meta-analysed these data using Petos method 
      (SMN) and Cox regression with inverse-variance pooling (OS, PFS) for each of the 
      five study questions, and performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the 
      applicability and robustness of the results. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 21 eligible 
      trials and obtained IPD for 16. For four studies no data were supplied despite 
      repeated efforts, while one study was only identified in 2015 and IPD were not 
      sought. For each study question, between three and six trials with between 1101 and 
      2996 participants in total and median follow-up between 6.7 and 10.8 years were 
      analysed. All participants were adults and mainly under 60 years. Risk of bias was 
      assessed as low for the majority of studies and outcomes. Chemotherapy alone versus 
      same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. Omitting additional radiotherapy probably 
      reduces secondary malignancy incidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.82, low quality of evidence), corresponding to an estimated 
      reduction of eight-year SMN risk from 8% to 4%. This decrease was particularly true 
      for secondary acute leukemias. However, we had insufficient evidence to determine 
      whether OS rates differ between patients treated with chemotherapy alone versus 
      combined-modality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.11, moderate quality of 
      evidence). There was a slightly higher rate of PFS with combined modality, but our 
      confidence in the results was limited by high levels of statistical heterogeneity 
      between studies (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.73, moderate quality of evidence). 
      Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus 
      extended-field radiation (early stages) . There is insufficient evidence to 
      determine whether smaller radiation field reduces SMN risk (Peto OR 0.86, 95% CI 
      0.64 to 1.16, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.89, 95% C: 0.70 to 1.12, high 
      quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21, high quality of 
      evidence). Chemotherapy plus lower-dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus 
      higher-dose radiation (early stages). There is insufficient evidence to determine 
      the effect of lower-radiation dose on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50, 
      low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28, high quality of 
      evidence) or PFS (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.48, high quality of evidence). Fewer 
      versus more courses of chemotherapy (each with or without radiotherapy; early 
      stages). Fewer chemotherapy courses probably has little or no effect on SMN risk 
      (Peto OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62), OS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to1.34) or PFS (HR 
      1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.45).Outcomes had a moderate (SMN) or high (OS, PFS) quality 
      of evidence. Dose-intensified versus ABVD-like chemotherapy (with or without 
      radiotherapy in each case). In the mainly advanced-stage patients who were treated 
      with intensified chemotherapy, the rate of secondary malignancies was low. There was 
      insufficient evidence to determine the effect of chemotherapy intensification (Peto 
      OR 1.37, CI 0.89 to 2.10, low quality of evidence). The rate of secondary acute 
      leukemias (and for younger patients, all secondary malignancies) was probably higher 
      than among those who had treatment with standard-dose ABVD-like protocols. In 
      contrast, the intensified chemotherapy protocols probably improved PFS (eight-year 
      PFS 75% versus 69% for ABVD-like treatment, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95, moderate 
      quality of evidence). Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified 
      chemotherapy was not conclusive (HR: 0.85, CI 0.70 to 1.04), although escalated-dose 
      BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival compared to ABVD-like chemotherapy (HR 0.58, 
      95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, moderate quality of evidence).Generally, we could draw valid 
      conclusions only in terms of secondary haematological malignancies, which usually 
      occur less than 10 years after initial treatment, while follow-up within the present 
      analysis was too short to record all solid tumours. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The risk 
      of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) is 
      increased but efficacy is improved among patients treated with intensified 
      chemotherapy protocols. Treatment decisions must be tailored for individual 
      patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of 
      secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define which patients can 
      safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and 
      advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of 
      fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced-dose radiotherapy did not 
      appear to markedly affect efficacy or secondary malignancy risk. Due to the limited 
      amount of long-term follow-up in this meta-analysis, further long-term 
      investigations of late events are needed, particularly with respect to secondary 
      solid tumours. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of 
      radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of osimertinib in the UK for advanced EGFR-T790M non-small cell 
      lung cancer.
PG  - 113-121
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2017.1377718 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study presents the cost-utility analysis that was developed to inform the 
      NICE health technology assessment of osimertinib vs platinum-based doublet 
      chemotherapy (PDC) in patients with EGFR-T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A partitioned survival 
      model with three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, and death) 
      from a UK payer perspective and over lifetime (15 years) was developed. Direct costs 
      included disease management, treatment-related (acquisition, administration, 
      monitoring, adverse events), and T790M testing costs. Efficacy and safety data were 
      taken from clinical trials AURA extension and AURA2 for osimertinib and IMPRESS for 
      PDC. An adjusted indirect treatment comparison was applied to reduce the potential 
      bias in the non-randomized comparison. Parametric functions were utilized to 
      extrapolate survival beyond the observed period. Health state utility values were 
      calculated from EQ-5D data collected in the trials and valued using UK tariffs. 
      Resource use and costs were based on published sources. RESULTS: Osimertinib was 
      associated with a gain of 1.541 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an 
      incremental cost of £64,283 vs PDC (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: 
      £41,705/QALY gained). Scenario analyses showed that none of the plausible scenarios 
      produced an ICER above £44,000 per QALY gained, and probabilistic sensitivity 
      analyses demonstrated a 63.4% probability that osimertinib will be cost-effective at 
      a willingness-to-pay threshold of £50,000. LIMITATIONS: The analysis is subject to 
      some level of uncertainty inherent to phase 2 single-arm data and the immaturity of 
      the currently available survival data for osimertinib. CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib may 
      be considered a cost-effective treatment option compared with PDC in the second-line 
      setting in patients with EGFR-T790M mutation-positive NSCLC from a UK payer 
      perspective. Further data from the ongoing AURA clinical trial program will reduce 
      the inherent uncertainty in the analysis.

TI  - Dutch Economic Value of Radium-223 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate 
      Cancer.
PG  - 133-143
LID - 10.1007/s40258-017-0350-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has 
      changed with the introduction of radium-223, cabazitaxel, abiraterone and 
      enzalutamide. To assess value for money, their cost effectiveness in patients with 
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel 
      from the Dutch societal perspective was investigated. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness 
      analysis was conducted using efficacy, symptomatic skeletal-related event and safety 
      data obtained from indirect treatment comparisons. Missing skeletal-related event 
      data for cabazitaxel were conservatively assumed to be identical to radium-223. A 
      Markov model combined these clinical inputs with Dutch-specific resource use and 
      costs for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment from a societal 
      perspective. Total quality-adjusted life-years and costs in 2017 euros were 
      calculated over a 5-year (lifetime) time horizon. RESULTS: Radium-223 resulted in 
      €6092 and €4465 lower costs and 0.02 and 0.01 higher quality-adjusted life-years 
      compared with abiraterone and cabazitaxel, respectively, demonstrating dominance of 
      radium-223. Sensitivity analyses reveal a 64% (54%) chance of radium-223 being cost 
      effective compared with abiraterone (cabazitaxel) at the informal €80,000 
      willingness-to-pay threshold. Compared with enzalutamide, radium-223 resulted in 
      slightly lower quality-adjusted life-years (-0.06) and €7390 lower costs, revealing 
      a 61% chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with enzalutamide. The 
      lower costs of radium-223 compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide are driven by 
      lower drug costs and prevention of expensive skeletal-related events. Compared with 
      cabazitaxel, the lower costs of radium-223 are driven by lower costs of the drug, 
      administration and adverse events. CONCLUSION: Radium-223 may be a less costly 
      treatment strategy offering similar gains in health benefits compared with 
      abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide in patients with metastatic 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the 
      Dutch societal perspective.

TI  - Optimal stump management in laparoscopic appendectomy: A network meta-analysis by 
      the Minimally Invasive Surgery Synthesis of Interventions and Outcomes Network.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic appendectomy is the predominant method of treatment of 
      acute appendicitis. There is insufficient evidence on the most effective management 
      of the appendix stump. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative 
      effectiveness and provide a treatment ranking of different options for securing the 
      appendix stump. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized 
      controlled trials comparing ligation methods of the appendix. The primary outcomes 
      were organ/space infection and superficial operative site infection. We performed a 
      network meta-analysis and estimated the pairwise relative treatment effects of the 
      competing interventions using the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. We 
      obtained a hierarchy of the competing interventions using rankograms and the surface 
      under the cumulative ranking curve. RESULTS: Forty-three randomized controlled 
      trials were eligible and provided data for >5,000 patients. Suture ligation seemed 
      to be the most effective treatment strategy, in terms of both organ/space infection 
      and superficial operative site infection. Statistical significance was reached for 
      the comparisons of clip versus endoloop (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval, 
      0.32-0.96) for organ/space infection; and suture versus clip (odds ratio 0.20, 95% 
      confidence interval 0.08-0.55) and clip versus endoloop (odds ratio 2.22, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.56-3.13) for superficial operative site infection. The network 
      was informed primarily by indirect treatment comparisons. CONCLUSION: The use of 
      suture ligation of the appendix in laparoscopic appendectomy seems to be superior to 
      other methods for the composite parameters of organ/space and superficial operative 
      site infection.

TI  - Can Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison Methods Mitigate Placebo Response 
      Differences Among Patient Populations in Adjunctive Trials of Brivaracetam and 
      Levetiracetam?
PG  - 899-910
LID - 10.1007/s40263-017-0462-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with focal seizures recruited into adjunctive 
      antiepileptic drug (AED) trials have become more refractory and severe over time; 
      concurrently, placebo responses have increased. To attempt to account for 
      heterogeneity among trials, propensity-score weighted patient-level data were used 
      to indirectly compare placebo responses reported in brivaracetam and levetiracetam 
      trials. METHODS: Patient-level data from randomised, placebo-controlled brivaracetam 
      (recruited 2007-2014) and levetiracetam (1993-1998) trials were pooled. Consistent 
      inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied and outcomes were defined consistently. 
      Potentially confounding baseline characteristics were adjusted for using propensity 
      score weighting. Weighting success was assessed using placebo response. RESULTS: In 
      total, 707 and 473 active drug and 399 and 253 placebo patients comprised the 
      brivaracetam and levetiracetam groups, respectively. Before weighting, several 
      baseline variables were significantly different between groups; after weighting, 
      prior vagal nerve stimulation, co-morbid depression and co-morbid anxiety remained 
      different. Before weighting, median seizure frequency reduction was 21.7 and 3.9% in 
      the brivaracetam and levetiracetam placebo arms, respectively; after weighting, 
      median reduction was 15.0 and 6.0%. The comparison of non-randomised groups could be 
      biased by unobserved confounding factors and region of residence. Lifetime AED 
      history was unavailable in the brivaracetam trials and excluded from analysis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Placebo responses remained different between brivaracetam and 
      levetiracetam trials after propensity score weighting, indicating the presence of 
      residual confounding factors associated with placebo response in these trials. It 
      therefore remains problematic to conduct reliable indirect comparisons of 
      brivaracetam and levetiracetam given the current evidence base, which may apply to 
      comparisons between other AED trials.

TI  - Newer antiepileptic drugs compared to levetiracetam as adjunctive treatments for 
      uncontrolled focal epilepsy: An indirect comparison.

LID - 10.1016/j.seizure.2017.07.017 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Eslicarbazepine (ESL), Lacosamide 
      (LAC), Perampanel (PER) and Brivaracetam (BRV), have been marketed as adjunctive 
      treatments for partial-onset seizures. Our aim was to compare the efficacy and 
      tolerability of newer AEDs with Levetiracetam (LEV), when used as add-on treatments 
      for uncontrolled focal epilepsy. METHOD: We conducted an online database search on 
      PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Online Library and Clinicaltrials.gov for all available 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the therapeutic effects of newer 
      AEDs or LEV vs placebo. Indirect comparisons for clinical efficacy and tolerability 
      at different doses between the newer AEDs and LEV were then performed using Indirect 
      Treatment Comparison (ITC) software. RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs with a total of 8540 
      patients were included. Compared to LEV, ESL, LAC and BRV did not showed significant 
      difference in efficacy at all dose level. PER showed lower 50% response rates and 
      seizure-free rates at the highest effective recommended dosages. Treatment-emergent 
      adverse events (TEAEs) and withdrawal rates due to adverse events (AEs) of LAC and 
      PER were higher than LEV at the highest effective recommended dosages, and overall 
      AE rates from ESL were higher than LEV. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons suggested 
      that ESL, LAC and BRV were not inferior to LEV in efficacy. ESL, LAC and PER may 
      have a possible worse tolerability profile compared to LEV at high dose. But BRV may 
      exhibit a similar tolerability to LEV. Newer AEDs cannot exceed the LEV on efficacy 
      and tolerability.

TI  - Methods for Population-Adjusted Indirect Comparisons in Health Technology Appraisal.
PG  - 200-211
LID - 10.1177/0272989X17725740 [doi]
AB  - Standard methods for indirect comparisons and network meta-analysis are based on 
      aggregate data, with the key assumption that there is no difference between the 
      trials in the distribution of effect-modifying variables. Methods which relax this 
      assumption are becoming increasingly common for submissions to reimbursement 
      agencies, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). 
      These methods use individual patient data from a subset of trials to form 
      population-adjusted indirect comparisons between treatments, in a specific target 
      population. Recently proposed population adjustment methods include the 
      Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) and the Simulated Treatment Comparison 
      (STC). Despite increasing popularity, MAIC and STC remain largely untested. 
      Furthermore, there is a lack of clarity about exactly how and when they should be 
      applied in practice, and even whether the results are relevant to the decision 
      problem. There is therefore a real and present risk that the assumptions being made 
      in one submission to a reimbursement agency are fundamentally different to-or even 
      incompatible with-the assumptions being made in another for the same indication. We 
      describe the assumptions required for population-adjusted indirect comparisons, and 
      demonstrate how these may be used to generate comparisons in any given target 
      population. We distinguish between anchored and unanchored comparisons according to 
      whether a common comparator arm is used or not. Unanchored comparisons make much 
      stronger assumptions, which are widely regarded as infeasible. We provide 
      recommendations on how and when population adjustment methods should be used, and 
      the supporting analyses that are required to provide statistically valid, clinically 
      meaningful, transparent and consistent results for the purposes of health technology 
      appraisal. Simulation studies are needed to examine the properties of population 
      adjustment methods and their robustness to breakdown of assumptions.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Adalimumab versus Secukinumab for the Treatment of 
      Psoriatic Arthritis: A Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison.
PG  - 349-362
LID - 10.1007/s40744-017-0070-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Phase III FUTURE I and II trials demonstrated the clinical 
      efficacy of secukinumab in active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In the absence of 
      head-to-head trials, this study compared the clinical efficacy and cost 
      effectiveness of adalimumab 40 mg versus secukinumab 150 and 300 mg for the 
      treatment of active PsA. METHODS: A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was 
      conducted using individual patient data from the ADEPT trial of adalimumab and 
      published data from FUTURE I and II. To adjust for the cross-trial differences, 
      individual patients in ADEPT were re-weighted so that the mean baseline 
      characteristics (including age, weight, gender, race, baseline methotrexate use, 
      psoriasis ≥3% body surface area, baseline PASI score, presence of dactylitis and 
      enthesitis, and HAQ-DI) matched those in the FUTURE trials. Response rates relative 
      to placebo and incremental costs per responder (CPR) over 24 weeks for ACR 20/50/70 
      and PASI 75/90 were compared between adalimumab and secukinumab 150 and 300 mg from 
      the German social health insurance (SHI) perspective. RESULTS: After matching, mean 
      baseline characteristics were balanced across the ADEPT and the FUTURE I and II 
      populations. The mean differences between adalimumab and secukinumab 150 mg in 
      relative ACR 20/50/70 and PASI 75/90 response rates were 9.5, 3.0, 6.0, 13.1, and 
      6.7%, respectively (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Post-match relative ACR 20/50/70 
      and PASI 75 to placebo were also higher with adalimumab compared to secukinumab 
      300 mg. Adalimumab had lower incremental costs per responder over 24 weeks for all 
      outcomes compared with secukinumab 150 and 300 mg. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of 
      direct comparisons between adalimumab and secukinumab, this study provides valuable 
      and reliable evidence for physicians and payers. After adjusting for cross-trial 
      differences in baseline characteristics, adalimumab was associated with higher 
      relative ACR and PASI rates and lower incremental CPRs compared with secukinumab 
      150 mg or 300 mg at week 24 among patients with active PsA. FUNDING: AbbVie.

TI  - Silver delivery approaches in the management of partial thickness burns: A 
      systematic review and indirect treatment comparison.
PG  - 707-721
LID - 10.1111/wrr.12559 [doi]
AB  - Silver-containing products play an important role in the management of burn wound 
      infections. We sought to compare the efficacy of commonly used silver delivery 
      approaches including nanocrystalline silver, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, 
      and silver-impregnated foam dressing as the main products in the management of 
      partial thickness burns. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, 
      EMBASE, Cochrane, and other databases to identify relevant randomized controlled 
      trials and observational studies. Due to the paucity of direct head-to-head trials, 
      an indirect treatment comparison was performed. The use of nanocrystalline silver 
      was associated with a statistically significant reduction in length of stay when 
      compared to silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing (p = 0.027) and a shorter time to 
      healing when compared to silver-impregnated foam dressing (p = 0.0328). There were 
      no statistically significant differences in infection rates and surgical procedures 
      between nanocrystalline silver, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, and 
      silver-impregnated foam dressing; however, nanocrystalline silver was found to be 
      the most beneficial for all the outcomes, including infection rates and surgical 
      procedures, according to the Monte Carlo simulation method. In conclusion, current 
      evidence from the published literature suggests that where the clinical and 
      microbiological priority is to get in control of infection quickly it would seem 
      prudent to use the most potent silver delivery system, which is nanocrystalline 
      silver. Nanocrystalline silver may offer both clinical and economic benefits 
      compared to alternative treatments in the management of patients with mixed burns 
      that are at high risk of infection.

TI  - Estimating the cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir + sofosbuvir versus 
      sofosbuvir + ribavirin for patients with genotype 3 hepatitis C virus.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/s12962-017-0077-4 [doi]
LID - 15
AB  - BACKGROUND: As treatments for chronic hepatitis C are moving away from 
      interferon-containing regimens, the most appropriate allocation of resources to 
      higher cost, interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens needs to be 
      assessed. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 is associated with faster disease 
      progression and has fewer treatment options, historically, than other HCV genotypes. 
      This analysis aims to estimate the comparative cost-effectiveness of two recently 
      licenced interferon-free regimens for the treatment of HCV genotype 3. METHODS: 
      Utilising a published Markov model and results of a matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison of recently published clinical trial data (ALLY-3 and VALENCE, 
      respectively), 12 weeks of treatment with daclatasvir + sofosbuvir (DCV + SOF) was 
      compared to 24 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir + ribavirin (SOF + RBV). 
      UK-specific model inputs were used to inform a cost-utility analysis of these 
      regimens. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, DCV + SOF was found to be dominant 
      over SOF + RBV in treatment-naïve patients, patients that had previously been 
      treated, and patients that are intolerant to, or ineligible for, 
      interferon-containing regimens. Given the low rates of treatment currently observed 
      in the UK, DCV + SOF was also compared to no treatment in the 
      interferon-ineligible/intolerant patients, and may be considered cost-effective with 
      an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £8817. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to 
      24 weeks of SOF + RBV, 12 weeks of treatment with DCV + SOF results in improved 
      quality of life and reduced total costs, and therefore is likely to represent 
      significant clinical and economic value as a treatment option for genotype 3 HCV 
      infection.

TI  - Network meta-analysis including treatment by covariate interactions: Consistency can 
      vary across covariate values.
PG  - 485-495
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1257 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many reviews aim to compare numerous treatments and report results 
      stratified by subgroups (eg, by disease severity). In such cases, a network 
      meta-analysis model including treatment by covariate interactions can estimate the 
      relative effects of all treatment pairings for each subgroup of patients. Two key 
      assumptions underlie such models: consistency of treatment effects and consistency 
      of the regression coefficients for the interactions. Consistency may differ 
      depending on the covariate value at which consistency is assessed. For valid 
      inference, we need to be confident of consistency for the relevant range of 
      covariate values. In this paper, we demonstrate how to assess consistency of 
      treatment effects from direct and indirect evidence at various covariate values. 
      METHODS: Consistency is assessed using visual inspection, inconsistency estimates, 
      and probabilities. The method is applied to an individual patient dataset comparing 
      artemisinin combination therapies for treating uncomplicated malaria in children 
      using the covariate age. RESULTS: The magnitude of the inconsistency appears to be 
      decreasing with increasing age for each comparison. For one comparison, direct and 
      indirect evidence differ for age 1 (P = .05), and this brings results for age 1 for 
      all comparisons into question. CONCLUSION: When fitting models including 
      interactions, the consistency of direct and indirect evidence must be assessed 
      across the range of covariates included in the trials. Clinical inferences are only 
      valid for covariate values for which results are consistent.

TI  - Aripiprazole Lauroxil Compared with Paliperidone Palmitate in Patients with 
      Schizophrenia: An Indirect Treatment Comparison.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aripiprazole lauroxil (AL) is a long-acting injectable atypical 
      antipsychotic recently approved for treatment of schizophrenia on the basis of a 
      large-scale trial of two doses of AL versus placebo. There are no direct-comparison 
      studies with paliperidone palmitate (PP; long-acting antipsychotic used most often 
      in acute settings) for the acute psychotic episode. OBJECTIVES: To indirectly 
      compare efficacy and safety of the pivotal AL study with all PP studies meeting 
      indirect comparison criteria. METHODS: Systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, 
      Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials 
      Registry Platform, and gray literature were performed to identify randomized 
      controlled trials of PP with similar designs to the AL trial. Bayesian network 
      meta-analysis compared treatments with respect to symptom response and tolerability 
      issues including weight gain, akathisia, parkinsonism, and likelihood of 
      treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Three appropriate PP studies were 
      identified for indirect comparison. Both doses of AL (441 mg and 882 mg monthly) 
      were used and compared with two efficacious doses of PP (156 mg and 234 mg monthly). 
      All four active-treatment conditions were associated with comparable reductions in 
      acute symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) versus placebo and were of 
      similar magnitude (range of mean difference -8.12 to -12.01, with overlapping 95% 
      credible intervals). Between-group comparisons of active-treatment arms were 
      associated with summary estimates of magnitude near 0. No clinically meaningful 
      differences in selected safety or tolerability parameter incidence were found 
      between active treatments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that both AL and PP 
      are effective for treatment of adults experiencing acute exacerbation of 
      schizophrenia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) as an add-on therapy for uncontrolled severe 
      asthma is an alternative to biologic therapies like omalizumab (OM). We conducted an 
      indirect treatment comparison (ITC) to appraise comparative effectiveness of BT and 
      OM. METHODS: A systematic literature review identified relevant randomized 
      controlled trials. The ITC followed accepted methodology. RESULTS: The ITC comprised 
      a sham-controlled trial of BT (AIR2) and two placebo-controlled trials of OM 
      (INNOVATE; EXTRA). Comparing the BT post-treatment period to ongoing treatment with 
      OM, showed no significant differences in the rate ratios (RRs) for severe 
      exacerbations (RR of BT versus OM = 0.91 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.30]; p = 0.62) or 
      hospitalizations (RR = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.17, 1.86]; p = 0.53); emergency department 
      visits were significantly reduced by 75% with BT (RR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.91]; p 
      = 0.04); the proportions of patients with clinically meaningful response on the 
      asthma quality-of-life questionnaire were comparable (RR = 1.06 [95% CI: 0.86, 
      1.34]; p = 0.59). The RR for exacerbations statistically favours OM over the total 
      study period in AIR2 (RR = 1.50 [95% CI: 1.11, 2.02]; p = 0.009) likely reflecting a 
      transient increase in events during the BT peri-treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      ITC should be interpreted cautiously considering the differences between patient 
      populations in the included trials. However, based on the analysis, BT compares well 
      with a potentially more costly pharmacotherapy for asthma. Clinicians evaluating the 
      relative merits of using these treatments should consider the totality of evidence 
      and patient preferences to make an informed decision.

TI  - Second-line Treatments for Advanced Gastric Cancer: A Network Meta-Analysis of 
      Overall Survival Using Parametric Modelling Methods.
PG  - 53-67
LID - 10.1007/s40487-017-0048-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Advanced gastric cancer (AGC) is one of the most common forms of 
      cancer and remains difficult to cure. There is currently no recommended therapy for 
      second-line AGC in the UK despite the availability of various interventions. This 
      paper aims to compare different interventions for treatment of second-line AGC using 
      more complex methods to estimate relative efficacy, fitting various parametric 
      models and to compare results to those published adopting conventional methods of 
      synthesis. METHODS: Seven studies were identified in an existing literature review 
      evaluating seven comparators, which formed a connected network of evidence. 
      Citations were limited to randomised controlled trials in previously-treated AGC 
      patients. Evidence quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. 
      Studies were assessed for the availability of Kaplan-Meier curves for overall 
      survival. Individual patient data (IPD) were recreated using digitisation software 
      along with a published algorithm in R. The data were analysed using 
      multi-dimensional network meta-analysis (NMA) methods. A series of parametric models 
      were fitted to the pseudo-IPD. Both fixed and random-effects models were fitted to 
      explore long-term survival prospects based on extrapolation methods and estimated 
      mean survival. RESULTS: Relative efficacy estimates were compared to those 
      previously reported, which utilised conventional NMA methods. Results presented were 
      consistent within findings from other publications and identified ramucirumab plus 
      paclitaxel as the best treatment; however, all the treatments assessed were 
      associated with poor survival prospects with mean survival estimates ranging from 
      5.0 to 12.7 months. CONCLUSION: Whilst the approach adopted in this paper does not 
      adjust for differences in trial patient populations and is particularly 
      data-intensive, use of such sophisticated methods of evidence synthesis may be more 
      informative for subsequent cost-effectiveness modelling and may have greater impact 
      when considering an indication where observed data is particularly immature or 
      survival prospects are more positive, which may then lead to more informative 
      decision-making for drug reimbursement.

AB  - Switching antidepressant therapy is a recommended strategy for depressed patients 
      who neither respond to nor tolerate an initial pharmacotherapy course. This paper 
      reviews the efficacy and tolerability of switching to vortioxetine. All three 
      published studies of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) switched from 
      SSRI/SNRI therapy to vortioxetine due to lack of efficacy or tolerability were 
      selected. Vortioxetine was evaluated versus agomelatine directly (REVIVE) and versus 
      sertraline, venlafaxine, bupropion, and citalopram in an indirect treatment 
      comparison (ITC) from switch studies retrieved in a literature review. 
      Vortioxetine׳s impact on SSRI-induced treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) 
      was assessed directly versus escitalopram (NCT01364649) in stable patients with MDD. 
      Vortioxetine׳s tolerability in the switch population was compared to the overall MDD 
      population. Vortioxetine showed significant benefits over agomelatine on efficacy, 
      functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes, with fewer withdrawals due to adverse 
      events (AEs) (REVIVE). Vortioxetine had numerically higher remission rates versus 
      all therapies included (ITC). Withdrawal rates due to AEs were significantly lower 
      for vortioxetine versus sertraline, venlafaxine, and bupropion, and numerically 
      lower versus citalopram. Switching to vortioxetine was statistically superior to 
      escitalopram in improving TESD (NCT01364649). Tolerability was similar in the switch 
      and overall MDD populations. These findings suggest that vortioxetine is an 
      effective switch therapy for patients with MDD whose response to SSRI/SNRI therapy 
      is inadequate. Vortioxetine was well tolerated and, for patients with a history of 
      TESD, showed significant advantages versus escitalopram. Vortioxetine appears to be 
      a valid option for patients with MDD who have not been effectively treated with 
      first-line pharmacotherapies.

TI  - Assessing the Budget Impact and Economic Outcomes of the Introduction of Daclatasvir

AB  - BACKGROUND: The advent of highly efficacious, well-tolerated, all-oral direct-acting 
      antiviral regimens has revolutionized the standard of care for patients chronically 
      infected with hepatitis C virus. As efficacy and safety rates converge, prescribers 
      and payers need to consider value for money. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the health 
      economic value of daclatasvir + asunaprevir versus sofosbuvir/ledipasvir via a 
      cost-effectiveness analysis, and determine the optimal treatment considering both 
      costs and health outcomes in Japan. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was 
      used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir + asunaprevir compared with 
      sofosbuvir/ledipasvir on the basis of a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of 
      pivotal trials and modeling inputs specific to the Japanese setting. A de novo 
      budget impact model was developed and used to predict the cost implications of 
      differing treatment sequences. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness results demonstrated 
      minimal difference in terms of benefit (0.037 fewer QALYs and 0.014 fewer life-years 
      with daclatasvir + asunaprevir); nevertheless, a significant difference in cost was 
      predicted (estimated ¥2,299,700 [US $21,695] reduction with daclatasvir + 
      asunaprevir). The budget impact analysis estimated that treatment with daclatasvir + 
      asunaprevir is expected to be less expensive than treatment with 
      sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (as the proportion of patients initially treated with 
      sofosbuvir/ledipasvir increased from 0% to 100%, total costs increased from ¥206 to 
      ¥403 billion [US $1.94 billion to US $3.80 billion]). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of 
      results from an established cost-effectiveness model and a conventional budget 
      impact analysis, treatment with daclatasvir + asunaprevir is expected to be 
      cost-saving compared with treatment with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in Japan with similar 
      health outcomes, regardless of treatment sequence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Network meta-analysis, a method to synthesise evidence from multiple 
      treatments, has increased in popularity in the past decade. Two broad approaches are 
      available to synthesise data across networks, namely, arm- and contrast-synthesis 
      models, with a range of models that can be fitted within each. There has been recent 
      debate about the validity of the arm-synthesis models, but to date, there has been 
      limited empirical evaluation comparing results using the methods applied to a large 
      number of networks. We aim to address this gap through the re-analysis of a large 
      cohort of published networks of interventions using a range of network meta-analysis 
      methods. METHODS: We will include a subset of networks from a database of network 
      meta-analyses of randomised trials that have been identified and curated from the 
      published literature. The subset of networks will include those where the primary 
      outcome is binary, the number of events and participants are reported for each 
      direct comparison, and there is no evidence of inconsistency in the network. We will 
      re-analyse the networks using three contrast-synthesis methods and two arm-synthesis 
      methods. We will compare the estimated treatment effects, their standard errors, 
      treatment hierarchy based on the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve, 
      the SUCRA value, and the between-trial heterogeneity variance across the network 
      meta-analysis methods. We will investigate whether differences in the results are 
      affected by network characteristics and baseline risk. DISCUSSION: The results of 
      this study will inform whether, in practice, the choice of network meta-analysis 
      method matters, and if it does, in what situations differences in the results 
      between methods might arise. The results from this research might also inform future 
      simulation studies.

TI  - Uterine Artery Embolization and Surgical Methods for the Treatment of Symptomatic 
      Uterine Leiomyomas: A Systemic Review and Meta-analysis Followed by Indirect 
      Treatment Comparison.

AB  - PURPOSE: There is significant discussion and uncertainty about the optimal 
      management of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas (SULs). Nonsurgical procedures such as 
      uterine artery embolization (UAE) have been developed. The goal of this study was to 
      conduct a meta-analysis and an indirect treatment comparison to examine the 
      comparative efficacy and safety of the surgical procedures to treat SULs compared 
      with UAE. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Lilacs, and the Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to February 2016. Ten 
      randomized controlled trials comparing UAE versus hysterectomy, myomectomy, and 
      laparoscopic occlusion of the uterine arteries in patients with SUL published in a 
      peer-reviewed journal were included. Two reviewers independently selected studies, 
      assessed quality, and extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus. 
      FINDINGS: Data from 986 patients submitted to UEA (n = 527) or surgery (n = 459) 
      were analyzed. UAE had a lower risk of major complications (risk ratio [RR], 0.45 
      [95% CI, 0.22-0.95]; P = 0.04)and a higher risk of minor complications (RR, 1.65 
      [95% CI, 1.32-2.06]; P < 0.00001); UAE had a higher risk of re-intervention up to 2 
      years (RR, 3.74 [95% CI, 1.76-7.96]; P = 0.0006) and up to 5 years (RR, 5.01 [95% 
      CI, 1.37-18.39]; P = 0.02); UAE had a similar risk of follicle-stimulating hormone 
      levels >40 IU/L after 6 months (RR, 1.76 [95% CI, 0.24-12.95]; P = 0.58)and of 
      recommending the procedure to another patient up to 5 years after treatment (RR, 
      1.00 [95% CI, 0.87-1.14]; P = 0.94). The indirect comparison between myomectomy and 
      hysterectomy found that the 2 procedures were similar in the studied outcomes. 
      IMPLICATIONS: Compared with surgery, UAE had lower rates of major complications with 
      an increased risk of re-intervention up to 2 and 5 years after the first procedure. 
      UAE compared with surgery had a similar risk of ovarian failure and similar 
      recommendation of the procedure to another patient. However, the number of trials 
      was limited, and there was a high risk of bias in at least 2 domains. None of the 
      trials blinded the participants and personnel or the outcome assessment. PROSPERO

TI  - Meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparison of lipegfilgrastim with 
      pegfilgrastim and filgrastim for the reduction of chemotherapy-induced 
      neutropenia-related events.
PG  - 412-423
LID - 10.1177/1078155217714859 [doi]
AB  - Background Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors are effective at reducing the risk 
      and duration of neutropenia. The current meta-analysis compared the 
      neutropenia-related efficacy and safety of lipegfilgrastim to those of pegfilgrastim 
      and filgrastim. Methods Embase was searched for trials examining the efficacy/safety 
      of lipegfilgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or filgrastim. Outcomes included febrile 
      neutropenia, severe neutropenia, duration of severe neutropenia, time to recovery of 
      absolute neutrophil count, and incidence of bone pain. Direct comparisons were made 
      using random-effects models. No trials directly compared lipegfilgrastim and 
      filgrastim. Indirect comparisons were made between lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim 
      with pegfilgrastim as the common comparator. Results This meta-analysis included a 
      total of 5769 patients from 24 studies. Over all cycles, lipegfilgrastim showed a 
      lower, nonsignificant risk of febrile neutropenia compared with pegfilgrastim. 
      Lipegfilgrastim has a lower risk of febrile neutropenia versus filgrastim but was 
      also not statistically significant. The risk ratio for severe neutropenia in cycle 1 
      was 0.80, a 20% reduction in favor of lipegfilgrastim. For cycles 2-4, the risk 
      ratio was 0.53 (0.35, 0.79) for lipegfilgrastim versus pegfilgrastim. The risk of 
      severe neutropenia in cycles 2-4 was also significantly lower for lipegfilgrastim 
      (risk ratio 0.45, 0.27, 0.75, respectively). No significant differences were found 
      for febrile neutropenia and severe neutropenia in cycle 1. However, in cycles 2-4, 
      lipegfilgrastim was associated with significant and clinically meaningful reductions 
      in risk of severe neutropenia versus either pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. Conclusions 
      Compared with pegfilgrastim or filgrastim, lipegfilgrastim has a statistically 
      significantly lower absolute neutrophil count recovery time; however, differences in 
      duration of severe neutropenia and bone pain were nonsignificant.

TI  - A Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Sonidegib and Vismodegib in Advanced 
      Basal Cell Carcinoma.
PG  - 6121760
LID - 10.1155/2017/6121760 [doi]
LID - 6121760
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Based on single-arm trial data (BOLT), sonidegib was approved in the US 
      and EU to treat locally advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) ineligible for 
      curative surgery or radiotherapy. Vismodegib, the other approved targeted therapy, 
      also was assessed in a single-arm trial (ERIVANCE). We examined the comparative 
      effectiveness of the two drugs using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) 
      versus an unadjusted indirect comparison. METHODS: After comparing trials and 
      identifying potential prognostic factors, an MAIC was conducted to adjust for 
      differences in key patient baseline characteristics. Due to BOLT's small sample 
      size, the number of matching variables was restricted to two. Efficacy results for 
      sonidegib were generated so that selected baseline characteristics matched those 
      from ERIVANCE and were compared with published ERIVANCE results. RESULTS: Matching 
      variables were baseline percentages of patients receiving prior radiotherapy and 
      surgery. After weighting, sonidegib objective response rate (ORR) and median 
      progression-free survival (PFS) were effectively unchanged (prematched versus 
      postmatched ORR and PFS, 56.1% versus 56.7% and 22.1 versus 22.1 months, resp.). 
      Vismodegib's ORR and PFS were 47.6% and 9.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative 
      effectiveness of sonidegib versus vismodegib remains unchanged after adjusting BOLT 
      patient-level data to match published ERIVANCE baseline percentages of patients 
      receiving prior surgery and radiotherapy.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of post-docetaxel therapies in metastatic castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 1995-2008
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2017.1341869 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer is a highly prevalent form of cancer in older men and is 
      one of the leading causes of death from cancer in men across the globe. Many 
      therapeutic agents have been approved for patients with metastatic 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), particularly as a post-docetaxel 
      treatment strategy. The objective of this systematic literature review was to assess 
      published efficacy and safety data for select mCRPC therapies - such as abiraterone, 
      cabazitaxel, and enzalutamide - in the post-docetaxel setting. METHODS: Database 
      searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL, in conjunction with hand searches 
      of multiple congress abstracts, yielded 13 randomized studies and 107 non-randomized 
      studies that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Randomized studies demonstrated 
      significant improvements in median overall survival (OS) outcomes over placebo for 
      abiraterone (15.8 vs. 11.2 months) and enzalutamide (18.4 vs. 13.6 months), and 
      similar significant improvements were noted for cabazitaxel over mitoxantrone (15.1 
      vs. 12.7 months). Differences in progression-free survival (PFS) were similarly 
      significant, although variance in the criteria for measuring PFS may limit the 
      extent to which these outcomes can be compared between studies. Non-randomized 
      evidence included multiple publications from several early access and compassionate 
      use programs with a primary objective to report safety outcomes. Results from these 
      studies largely reflected the findings in randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 
      there is a growing body of evidence for post-docetaxel treatment options available 
      in patients with mCRPC. Further head-to-head trials or indirect treatment 
      comparisons may be a valuable method to assess the comparative efficacy of these 
      therapies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the current state of 
      reporting and handling of effect modification in network meta-analyses (NMAs) and 
      perform exploratory analyses to identify variables that are potentially associated 
      with incomplete reporting of effect modifiers in NMAs. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We 
      conducted a meta-epidemiological survey using a systematic review of NMAs published 
      in 2013 and identified through MEDLINE and Embase databases. RESULTS: The review 
      identified 77 NMAs. The most common type of effect modifiers identified and explored 
      were patient characteristics (50.7% or 39/77), and the most common adjustment method 
      used was sensitivity analysis (51.7% or 30/58). Over 45% (35/77) of studies did not 
      describe a plan, nearly 40% (30/77) did not report the results of analyses, and 
      approximately 47% (36/77) of studies had incomplete reporting. Exploratory 
      univariate regression analyses yielded a statistically significant association for 
      the variables of journal impact factor, ratio of randomized controlled trials to 
      number of comparisons, and total number of randomized controlled trials. CONCLUSION: 
      Current reporting practices are largely deficient, given that almost half of 
      identified published NMAs do not explore or report effect modification. Journal 
      impact factor and amount of available information in a network were associated with 
      completeness of reporting.

TI  - Comparative Efficacy of Ibrutinib Versus Obinutuzumab + Chlorambucil in First-Line 
      Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: A Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison.
PG  - 1650-1661
LID - 10.1007/s12325-017-0564-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ibrutinib (ibr) monotherapy and the combination of obinutuzumab plus 
      chlorambucil (obi) are approved for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia (CLL). No trials directly comparing their efficacy are available. Therefore 
      a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to provide insight into 
      their relative efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
      survival (OS). MAIC attempts to adjust for between-trial differences in factors 
      known or suspected to influence treatment effects, to minimize bias. METHODS: A MAIC 
      within a Bayesian framework was conducted using individual patient data from the 
      RESONATE-2 study of ibr versus chlorambucil and published data from the CLL11 study 
      of obi versus chlorambucil. Both studies were conducted in patients ineligible for 
      full-dose fludarabine-based therapy. After matching, the reweighted adjusted 
      relative efficacy measure of ibr versus chlorambucil from RESONATE-2 [hazard ratio 
      (HR), 95% credible interval (CrI)] was compared with that of obi versus chlorambucil 
      from CLL11 for each endpoint, using a Bayesian indirect comparison. RESULTS: Our 
      results suggest that in a population with similar average baseline characteristics 
      to CLL11, ibr would improve PFS and OS outcomes compared to obi. Before matching, 
      the HRs for ibr versus obi were 0.48 [CrI = 0.22-1.02, p(HR <1) = 97%], 0.85 
      [CrI = 0.44-1.63, p(HR <1) = 69%], and 0.40 [CrI = 0.10-1.54, p(HR <1) = 91%] for 
      PFS by investigator assessment, PFS by independent review committee, and OS, 
      respectively. After matching on all available characteristics the HRs decreased to 
      0.12 [CrI = 0.02-0.97, p(HR <1) = 98%], 0.24 [CrI = 0.04-1.35, p(HR <1) = 95%], and 
      0.21 [CrI = <0.01-8.89, p(HR <1) = 79%], respectively. There was a large variance 
      around the treatment effect for OS due to the low number of deaths. CONCLUSION: Our 
      analysis suggests that ibrutinib is highly likely to provide greater PFS benefit 
      than obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in older or less fit patients with previously 
      untreated CLL. There is also an indication of improvement in OS, albeit with a 
      higher uncertainty due to the low number of events. FUNDING: Janssen-Cilag Ltd.

      of treatments for hemophilia B.
PG  - 39-48
LID - 10.2217/cer-2017-0028 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To develop a modeling approach to compare clinical outcomes of nonacog beta 
      pegol to a standard-acting factor IX (FIX) product. METHODS: Regression analysis 
      linked FIX activity to bleed rates. Pharmacokinetic parameters were used to estimate 
      FIX activity over time. The probability of bleeds was estimated for both treatment 
      arms. A Markov model estimated the presence of target joints and annualized bleed 
      rates (ABRs). RESULTS: Higher FIX activity showed reduced ABRs (p < 0.001). Target 
      joints resulted in higher bleed rates (p < 0.001). When FIX activity levels and 
      bleed risks were applied to the Markov model, ABRs for nonacog beta pegol and its 
      comparator were 2.40 and 6.36, respectively. CONCLUSION: This model provides a 
      starting point for assessing the added value of new FIX products.

AB  - The study reports Mentha cardiaca essential oil (EO) as plant based preservative 
      against fungal and aflatoxin contamination of stored dry fruits. Mycoflora analysis 
      of the dry fruits revealed Aspergillus favus LHP-PV-1 as the most aflatoxigenic 
      isolate with highest Aflatoxin B(1) content. M. cardiaca EO showed broad fungitoxic 
      spectrum inhibiting the tested moulds contaminating dry fruits. It's minimum 
      inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum aflatoxin inhibitory concentration (MAIC) 
      and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) against A. favus LHP-PV-1 were recorded 
      to be 1.25, 1.0 and 2.25 µL/mL respectively. The EO caused decrease in ergosterol 
      content and enhanced leakage of Ca(2+), K(+) and Mg(2+) ions from treated fungal 
      cells, depicting fungal plasma membrane as the site of antifungal action. The EO 
      showed promising DPPH free radical scavenging activity (IC(50) value:15.89 µL/mL) 
      and favourable safety profile with LD(50) value (7133.70 mg/kg body wt.) when 
      estimated through acute oral toxicity on mice. Carvone (61.62%) was recorded as the 
      major component of the oil during chemical characterisation through GC-MS. Based on 
      strong antifungal, antiaflatoxigenic and antioxidant potential, the chemically 
      characterised M. cardiaca EO may be recommended as safe plant based preservative and 
      shelf life enhancer of food items. This is the first report on antifungal and 
      antiaflatoxigenic activity of M. cardiaca EO.

TI  - Transfemoral, transapical and transcatheter aortic valve implantation and surgical 
      aortic valve replacement: a meta-analysis of direct and adjusted indirect 
      comparisons of early and mid-term deaths.
PG  - 484-492
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivx150 [doi]
AB  - Clinical outcomes of transfemoral-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) 
      versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transapical (TA)-TAVI are limited 
      to a few randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Because previous meta-analyses only 
      included a limited number of adjusted studies or several non-adjusted studies, our 
      goal was to compare and summarize the outcomes of TF-TAVI vs SAVR and TF-TAVI vs 
      TA-TAVI exclusively with the RCT and propensity-matched cohort studies with direct 
      and adjusted indirect comparisons to reach more precise conclusions. We hypothesized 
      that TF-TAVI would offer surgical candidates a better outcome compared with SAVR and 
      TA-TAVI because of its potential for fewer myocardial injuries. A literature search 
      was conducted through PUBMED and EMBASE through June 2016. Only RCTs and 
      propensity-matched cohort studies were included. A direct meta-analysis of TF-TAVI 
      vs SAVR, TA-TAVI vs SAVR and TF-TAVI vs TA-TAVI was conducted. Then, the effect size 
      of an indirect meta-analysis was calculated from the direct meta-analysis. The 
      effect sizes of direct and indirect meta-analyses were then combined. A 
      random-effects model was used to calculate the hazards ratio and the odds ratio with 
      95% confidence intervals. Early (in-hospital or 30 days) and mid-term (≥1 year) 
      all-cause mortality rates were assessed. Our search resulted in 4 RCTs (n = 2319) 
      and 14 propensity-matched cohort (n = 7217) studies with 9536 patients of whom 3471, 
      1769 and 4296 received TF, TA and SAVR, respectively. Direct meta-analyses and 
      combined direct and indirect meta-analyses of early and mid-term deaths with TF-TAVI 
      and SAVR were similar. Early deaths with TF-TAVI vs TA-TAVI were comparable in 
      direct meta-analyses (odds ratio 0.64, P = 0.35) and direct and indirect 
      meta-analyses combined (odds ratio 0.73, P = 0.24). Mid-term deaths with TF-TAVI vs 
      TA-TAVI were increased (hazard ratio 0.83, P = 0.07) in a direct meta-analysis and 
      became significant after addition of the indirect meta-analysis (hazard ratio 0.78, 
      95% confidence interval 0.67-0.92, P = 0.003). In conclusion, TF-TAVI was associated 
      with similar early and mid-term deaths compared with SAVR. The number of early 
      deaths was not significantly different between TF-TAVI and TA-TAVI, whereas there 
      were fewer mid-term deaths with TF-TAVI than with TA-TAVI.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of different circumcisions for patients with 
      redundant prepuce or phimosis: A network meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phimosis and redundant prepuce are defined as the inability of the 
      foreskin to be retracted behind the glans penis in uncircumcised males. To 
      synthesize the evidence and provide the hierarchies of different circumcisions for 
      phimosis and redundant prepuce, we performed an overall network meta-analysis (NMA) 
      based on their comparative efficacy and safety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic 
      databases including PubMed, Embase, Wan Fang, VIP, CNKI and CBM database were 
      researched from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for redundant prepuce or 
      phimosis. We conducted the direct and indirect comparisons by aggregate data drug 
      information system (ADDIS) software. Moreover, consistency models were applied to 
      assess the differences among the male circumcision practices, and the ranks based on 
      probabilities of intervention for the different endpoints were performed. 
      Node-splitting analysis was used to test inconsistency. RESULTS: Eighteen RCTs were 
      included with 6179 participants. Compared with the conventional circumcision(CC), 
      two new styles of circumcisions, the disposable circumcision suture device(DCSD) and 
      Shang Ring circumcision(SRC), provided significantly shorter operation time[DCSD:

      (OR) = 11.42, 95%CI (3.60, 37.68); SRC: OR = 3.85,95%CI (1.29, 12.79)]. 
      Additionally, DCSD showed a lower adverse events rate than other two treatments. 
      However, no significant difference was shown in all surgeries for 24 h postoperative 
      pain score. Node-splitting analysis showed that no significant inconsistency was 
      existed (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of NMA, DCSD may be a most 
      effective and safest choice for phimosis and redundant prepuce. DCSD has the 
      advantages of a shorter operation time, better postoperative penile appearance, 
      fewer complication and shorter wound healing time. However, with the limitations of 
      our study, additional multi-center RCTs are needed to evaluate the outcomes.

      indirect comparisons.

AB  - As more and more generics become available in the market place, the safety/efficacy 
      concerns may arise as the result of interchangeably use of approved generics. 
      However, bioequivalence assessment for regulatory approval among generics of the 
      innovative drug product is not required. In practice, approved generics are often 
      used interchangeably without any mechanism of safety monitoring. In this article, 
      based on indirect comparisons, we proposed several methods to assessing 
      bioequivalence and interchangeability between generics. The applicability of the 
      methods and the similarity assumptions were discussed, as well as the 
      inappropriateness of directly adopting adjusted indirect comparison to the field of 
      generics' comparison. Besides, some extensions were given to take into consideration 
      the important topics in clinical trials for bioequivalence assessments, for example, 
      multiple comparisons and simultaneously testing bioequivalence among three generics. 
      Extensive simulation studies were conducted to investigate the performances of the 
      proposed methods. The studies of malaria generics and HIV/AIDS generics prequalified 
      by the WHO were used as real examples to demonstrate the use of the methods.

TI  - Daratumumab monotherapy compared with historical control data in heavily pretreated 
      and highly refractory patients with multiple myeloma: An adjusted treatment 
      comparison.
PG  - E146-E152
LID - 10.1002/ajh.24781 [doi]
AB  - Daratumumab is a human CD38-directed monoclonal antibody approved in the United 
      States as monotherapy for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received ≥3 
      prior lines of therapy (LOTs), including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an 
      immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) or who are double refractory to a PI and an IMiD, and 
      in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or bortezomib/dexamethasone for 
      patients with MM who have received ≥1 prior LOT. This study compared the efficacy of 
      daratumumab monotherapy versus historical controls through adjusted treatment 
      comparison. Patient-level data were pooled from two daratumumab monotherapy studies 
      (16 mg/kg; GEN501 and SIRIUS) and two independent US databases (IMS LifeLink and 
      OPTUM), which reflect treatments used in real-world patients with MM who received ≥3 
      prior LOTs or were double refractory to a PI and an IMiD. Using a multivariate 
      proportional hazards regression model, the relative treatment effect of daratumumab 
      versus historical controls was estimated, adjusting for imbalances in 
      characteristics between cohorts. Baseline characteristics that differed between 
      patients treated with daratumumab (N = 148) and historical control (N = 658) were 
      prior treatment with pomalidomide (55% vs 15%) or carfilzomib (41% vs 28%) and 
      triple/quadruple refractory status (64% vs 14%). The adjusted overall 
      survival-hazard ratio (OS-HR) for daratumumab versus historical control was 0.33 
      (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.46) compared with 0.46 (0.35-0.59) for unadjusted 
      HR. Impact of adjustment was mainly driven by refractory status and prior 
      pomalidomide/carfilzomib exposure. This adjusted treatment comparison suggests that 
      daratumumab demonstrates improved OS compared with historical control data in 
      heavily pretreated and highly refractory MM patients.

TI  - Comparison between long-acting injectable aripiprazole versus paliperidone palmitate 
      in the treatment of schizophrenia: systematic review and indirect treatment 
      comparison.
PG  - 235-248
LID - 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000177 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the relative efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole once monthly 
      (AOM) versus paliperidone palmitate (PP) for treating schizophrenia. Extensive 
      databases searches on short-term, placebo-controlled, randomized studies of AOM and 
      PP were performed. Indirect treatment comparisons were performed between the two 
      long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIAs). The primary efficacy endpoint was the 
      mean change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score from baseline 
      between each LAIA and placebo. The effect sizes were mean differences and odds ratio 
      (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary efficacy endpoint and 
      safety/tolerability between two LAIAs, respectively. Mean difference in the primary 
      efficacy endpoint was significantly different, favouring AOM over PP (OR: -6.4; 95% 
      CI: -11.402 to -1.358); sensitivity analyses and noninferiority test (AOM vs. PP) 
      confirmed the primary results. The overall early dropout rate was not significantly 
      different between AOM and PP (OR: 1.223; 95% CI: 0.737-2.03). However, there was a 
      significant difference in the early dropout rate in terms of lack of efficacy 
      favouring AOM over PP (OR: 0.394; 95% CI: 0.185-0.841). Within the context of the 
      inherent limitations of the current analysis, our results may suggest that there may 
      be relative advantages for AOM over PP in the short-term treatment of schizophrenia.

TI  - Chemoprevention of prostate cancer in men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial 
      neoplasia (HGPIN): a systematic review and adjusted indirect treatment comparison.
PG  - 36674-36684
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.16230 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is the precursor 
      or premalignant form of prostate cancer. At least 30% patients with a confirmed 
      HGPIN will develop prostate cancer within 1 year after repeated biopsy. HGPIN 
      patients are the appropriate at-risk population for chemoprevention strategies 
      investigation against prostate cancer. However the commonly used chemoprevention 
      agents that targeted on hormonal imbalance or lifestyle-related factors showed 
      varied results in HGPIN patients. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted in 
      PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library according to Cochrane guidelines before January 
      31st, 2017. Direct meta-analysis were performed to summarize the efficacy of 
      candidate chemopreventative agents Dutasteride, Flutamide, Toremifene, Selenium, 
      Green tea components, Lycopene and natural food products combination. Adjusted 
      indirect meta-analyses were employed to compare the relative efficacy of these 
      candidate chemoprevention agents head-to-head. RESULTS: The overall incidence of 
      prostate cancer in HGPIN was slightly decreased by chemoprevention agents (25.7% vs 
      31.5%, RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.83-1.03, P = 0.183), with minor heterogeneity (I2 = 
      22.3%, ð2 = 15.08, P = 0.237), but without statistical significance. Subgroup 
      analysis showed that green tea catechins significantly decreased prostate cancer in 
      HGPIN patients (7.60% vs 23.1%, RR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.16-10.97, P P = 0.044), with 
      moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 47.9%, ð2 = 1.92, P = 0.166). The adjusted indirect 
      meta-analysis favored green tea catechins over other chemoprevention agents, and 
      significantly when compared to natural food products combination (RR = 0.355, 95% 
      CI: 0.134-0.934). CONCLUSION: The overall efficacy of chemoprevention agents in 
      HGPIN patients is limited. But Green tea catechins showed the superiority to 
      decrease prostate cancer in HGPIN patients.

TI  - Integrated services and early intervention in the vocational rehabilitation of 
      people with spinal cord injuries.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The design was a narrative review. The objective of the study was to 
      investigate the potential for early vocational rehabilitation (VR) interventions for 
      people with spinal cord injury (SCI) in overcoming barriers in returning to work, 
      and to pinpoint factors contributing to effectiveness in early VR intervention for 
      this population. The setting was at Queensland, Australia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Synthesis of the findings of a literature search of online databases ProQuest and 
      CINAHL, using keywords relating to the employment situation and VR of people with 
      SCI. Themes were identified and analysed in accordance with the research objectives. 
      RESULTS: Despite increasing government commitment to the workforce and social 
      participation of people with disabilities, Australians living with SCI have 
      significantly diminished employment outcomes compared with the general population. 
      Current VR approaches usually do not commence until some months post discharge, 
      potentially missing a window of opportunity to preserve pre-existing employment or 
      assist in vocational decision making. The review found that there are opportunities 
      for enhancing VR service provision following SCI, namely integrating the VR 
      programme within the primary rehabilitation team thus facilitating early VR 
      intervention. DISCUSSION: Emerging evidence shows promising results for early 
      intervention in VR; however, questions remain regarding ideal intervention 
      approaches, and it is clear that further empirical investigation is required to 
      support the use of early intervention models post SCI. The study was sponsored by 
      Motor Accident Insurance Commission (MAIC).

TI  - Evidence Is Enough?: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of the Efficacy 
      of Tamsulosin 0.2 mg and Tamsulosin 0.4 mg as an Initial Therapeutic Dose in Asian 
      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Patients.
PG  - 29-37
LID - 10.5213/inj.1734826.413 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the efficacy of tamsulosin between 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg in Asian 
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients using network meta-analysis due to lack of 
      studies with direct comparison. METHODS: The literature search was conducted using 
      the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Keywords used were "BPH," "tamsulosin," 
      "placebo." Experimental groups were defined as tamsulosin 0.2 mg (Tam 0.2) and 0.4 
      mg (Tam 0.4) and common control group was defined as placebo for indirect treatment 
      comparison. Mixed treatment comparison was performed including one direct comparison 
      study. RESULTS: Seven studies met the eligible criteria. Indirect treatment 
      comparison revealed that total International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) and 
      quality of life score of IPSS were not significantly different in Tam 0.2 and Tam 
      0.4 (P>0.05). There was no significant difference of maximal flow rate and postvoid 
      residual urine volume in Tam 0.2 and Tam 0.4 (P>0.05). Mixed treatment comparison 
      including one direct comparison study showed inconsistency (P<0.001). Therefore, 
      analysis using direct treatment comparison effect sizes of Tam 0.2 vs. placebo and 
      Tam 0.4 vs. placebo was done and there was no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Network meta-analysis showed no difference of efficacy between tamsulosin 0.2 mg and 
      0.4 mg and the evidence of tamsulosin 0.4 mg as initial dose for Asian BPH patient 
      seems to be insufficient. Therefore, initial dose of tamsulosin for Asian BPH 
      patient should be 0.2 mg.

TI  - Evaluation of Adjusted and Unadjusted Indirect Comparison Methods in Benefit 
      Assessment. A Simulation Study for Time-to-event Endpoints.
PG  - 261-267
LID - 10.3414/ME15-02-0016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the Act on the Reform of the Market for Medicinal Products (AMNOG) 
      in Germany, pharmaceutical manufacturers are obliged to submit a dossier 
      demonstrating added benefit of a new drug compared to an appropriate comparator. 
      Underlying evidence was planned for registration purposes and therefore often does 
      not meet the appropriate comparator as defined by the Federal Joint Committee 
      (G-BA). For this reason AMNOG allows indirect comparisons to assess the extent of 
      added benefit. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the characteristics 
      and applicability of adjusted indirect comparison described by Bucher and 
      Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) in various situations within the early 
      benefit assessment according to §35a Social Code Book 5. In particular, we consider 
      time-to-event endpoints. METHODS: We conduct a simulation study where we consider 
      three different scenarios: I) similar study populations, II) dissimilar study 
      populations without interactions and III) dissimilar study populations with 
      interactions between treatment effect and effect modifiers. We simulate data from a 
      Cox model with Weibull distributed survival times. Desired are unbiased effect 
      estimates. We compare the power and the proportion of type 1 errors of the methods. 
      RESULTS: I) Bucher and MAIC perform equivalently well and yield unbiased effect 
      estimates as well as proportions of type 1 errors below the significance level of 
      5 %. II) Both Bucher and MAIC yield unbiased effect estimates, but Bucher shows a 
      higher power for detection of true added benefit than MAIC. III) Only MAIC, but not 
      Bucher yields unbiased effect estimates. When using robust variance estimation MAIC 
      yields a proportion of type 1 error close to 5 %. In general, power of all methods 
      for indirect comparisons is low. An increasing loss of power for the indirect 
      comparisons can be observed as the true treatment effects decrease. CONCLUSION: Due 
      to the great loss of power and the potential bias for indirect comparisons, 
      head-to-head trials using the appropriate comparator as defined by the Federal Joint 
      Committee should be conducted whenever possible. However, indirect comparisons are 
      needed if no such direct evidence is available. To conduct indirect comparisons in 
      case of a present common comparator and similar study populations in the trials to 
      be compared, both Bucher and MAIC can be recommended. In case of using adjusted 
      effect measures (such as Hazard Ratio), the violation of the similarity assumption 
      has no relevant effect on the Bucher approach as long as interactions between 
      treatment effect and effect modifiers are absent. Therefore Bucher can still be 
      considered appropriate in this specific situation. In the authors' opinion, MAIC can 
      be considered as an option (at least as sensitivity analysis to Bucher) if such 
      interactions are present or cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, in practice MAIC is 
      potentially biased and should always be considered with utmost care.

      comparison.
PG  - 313-323
LID - 10.2217/cer-2016-0085 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Using matching-adjusted indirect comparison, we compared efficacy outcomes in 
      patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis treated with delayed-release 
      dimethyl fumarate (DMF) or glatiramer acetate (GA). MATERIALS & METHODS: An indirect 
      comparison of DMF (patient-level data) and GA (aggregate data) was conducted, with 
      average baseline characteristics of DMF patients weighted to match those for GA 
      patients. Direct comparison of DMF and GA was conducted in CONFIRM. Final results 
      pooled the indirect and direct comparisons using meta-analysis. RESULTS: After 
      matching, baseline characteristics were balanced between DMF and GA patients. 
      Compared with GA, efficacy was significantly in favor of DMF as measured by 
      annualized relapse rate (rate ratio: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.57-1.00; p = 0.0474) and 
      12-week confirmed disability progression (risk ratio: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.46-0.76; p < 
      0.0001). CONCLUSION: DMF demonstrated superior clinical efficacy versus GA.

TI  - Indirect treatment comparison of two non-invasive patient-controlled analgesia 
      treatments for acute post-operative pain management.
PG  - 911-918
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2017.1294560 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relative clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability 
      associated with two non-invasive patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) treatments, 
      sufentanil sublingual tablet system (SSTS) and fentanyl iontophoretic 
      patient-controlled transdermal system (PCTS). These two treatments have recently 
      been approved in the EU for the management of acute moderate-to-severe 
      post-operative pain in adult patients. METHODS: As no head-to-head trials comparing 
      SSTS and PCTS currently exist, indirect treatment comparison (ITC) analyses were 
      conducted to evaluate SSTS or PCTS versus intravenous (IV) morphine PCA. RESULTS: 
      Five studies, four assessing PCTS and one assessing SSTS, were included in this 
      analysis. SSTS had statistical or numerical advantages over PCTS for both patient 
      global assessment (PGA) and healthcare professional global assessment (HPGA) 
      outcomes at all time points investigated. SSTS was also associated with greater 
      patient ease of use (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 0.13; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: -0.02-0.28) and a higher patient satisfaction score (WMD: 0.31; 95% CI: 
      0.05-0.57; p = .019) compared with PCTS. In terms of tolerability, all-cause 
      withdrawals from treatment were reported to be less likely with SSTS (risk ratio: 
      0.65; 95% CI: 0.42-1.02). No significant differences were observed between SSTS and 
      PCTS in terms of safety and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of direct 
      head-to-head data, the combination of promising phase III trial results compared to 
      IV morphine PCA, a SLR comparison against other opioid treatments, and the results 
      of this exploratory analysis present a strong rationale in support of SSTS as a key 
      option for management of post-operative pain.

TI  - Evaluating the Feasibility of Use of a Foreign Reference Product for Generic Drug 
      Applications: A Retrospective Pilot Study.
PG  - 935-942
LID - 10.1007/s13318-017-0409-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The adoption of a domestic reference product in 
      bioequivalence (BE) studies for generic drug applications is required by some 
      countries. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of this by 
      investigating whether innovative products from different countries are 
      bioequivalent. METHODS: Data were collected from all generic drug applications 
      received by the Taiwan regulatory authority 2012-2016. If a submission package 
      contained BE studies, that generic product was compared separately with different 
      reference products, and the resulting data included in this analysis. A method of 
      adjusted indirect comparison was used to evaluate the BE of reference products from 
      different sources. The relationship between in vitro dissolution and in vivo BE was 
      also explored. RESULTS: The present study included 10 drugs and a total of 11 
      comparisons. Seven comparisons for maximum concentration (C (max)) (63.6%) and all 
      comparisons (100.0%) for area under the curve up to last measurable time point (AUC) 
      complied with the BE criterion. Similar in vitro dissolution profiles were observed 
      in all comparisons. Among the comparisons that failed to demonstrate BE, only one 
      was considered to be possibly related to product difference, with point estimates of 
      indirect comparison for C (max) significantly greater than unity (22%). Discordance 
      between in vitro and in vivo observations was probably due to either drugs with 
      highly variable properties or a lack of discriminatory dissolution testing method. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although this retrospective analysis only included a few drugs and 
      product formulation types, i.e., immediate release, delayed release, and orally 
      disintegrating tablet, these preliminary results suggest that using a foreign 
      reference product in BE studies for generic drug applications could be a feasible 
      approach, but with some restrictions: comparable dissolution profiles, same 
      innovator company, same size, weight, and type of coating as the domestic reference 
      product, etc. Further investigations for other complex formulations are required.

AB  - Many therapeutic options are now available for patients with multiple sclerosis. 
      While the efficacy of each drug has been assessed against placebo or, more recently, 
      against interferon, no direct comparisons of these new therapies have been conducted 
      in randomized clinical trials. Therefore, indirect treatment comparisons are needed 
      to inform clinical decisions. In this brief report, some basic concepts about 
      network meta-analyses that are the formal methods used to run multiple indirect 
      treatment comparisons are reviewed when applied in the context of multiple sclerosis 
      studies.

TI  - [Comparison of the cost-utility of direct oral anticoagulants for the prevention of 
      stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation in Spain].
PG  - 247-256
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban are three new direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) used in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in 
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in Spain. AIM: To assess the 
      relative cost-utility of the three DOACs compared with vitamin K antagonists. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model with 3-month cycles was used to simulate NVAF 
      patients starting with treatment and followed up for their lifetime from the 
      perspective of the National Health System. The model included 36 health states 
      including treatment combinations, disability and events history and considered a 
      hypothetical cohort of 10,000 NVAF patients. Relative efficacy was calculated from a 
      formal indirect treatment comparison using data from the pivotal trials of each 
      DOAC. RESULTS: Dabigatran was associated with the highest number of quality-adjusted 
      life years (QALY) (8.40 QALY), followed by apixaban (8.33 QALY), rivaroxaban (8.15 
      QALY) and acenocoumarol (8.03 QALY). Patients taking acenocoumarol had the lowest 
      total costs (€22,230), followed by dabigatran (€24,564), apixaban (€24,655) and 
      rivaroxaban (€25,900). Incremental cost-utility ratios compared to vitamin K 
      antagonists, were €6,397, €8,039 and €29,957/QALY for dabigatran, apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban, respectively. If compared together, dabigatran dominated apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the baseline case. 
      CONCLUSIONS: All three direct anticoagulants are cost-effective against 
      acenocoumarol. Dabigatran is economically dominant over rivaroxaban and apixaban in 
      the Spanish setting, as it is more effective and cheaper.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors can improve 
      hyperkinetic movements, and are effective treatment options for chorea of Huntington 
      disease (HD). Tetrabenazine was assessed for treating chorea in the TETRA-HD trial, 
      and while efficacious, there are tolerability concerns possibly due to its 
      pharmacokinetic properties. Deutetrabenazine is a novel VMAT2 inhibitor that 
      contains deuterium, which extends active metabolite half-lives and minimizes drug 
      concentration fluctuations. In the First-HD trial, deutetrabenazine was efficacious 
      in treating chorea and was generally well tolerated. In the absence of a 
      head-to-head trial, we performed an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of the 
      tolerability of deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine for the treatment of 
      HD-associated chorea, as observed in the First-HD and TETRA-HD trials, using 
      well-established comparison methods. METHODS: Data from the Phase III, 12-week, 
      parallel-group, clinical trials First-HD (N = 90) and TETRA-HD (N = 84) were used to 
      conduct an ITC of the tolerability of deutetrabenazine versus tetrabenazine using 
      two anchor-based methods: Bucher comparison for unadjusted ITCs, and matching 
      indirect comparison for adjusted ITCs. Overall adverse events (AEs; mild, moderate, 
      and severe), serious AEs, specific AEs occurring in ≥10% of patients, and 
      discontinuations (all-cause and AE-related) were included in the analysis. The risk 
      differences of these outcomes for deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine were estimated 
      by subtracting the applicable placebo-adjusted risk in First-HD from that of 
      TETRA-HD. Sensitivity analyses were performed to address differences between trials, 
      and p-values were obtained from z-tests. RESULTS: Compared with tetrabenazine, 
      deutetrabenazine was associated with a significantly lower risk of moderate to 
      severe AEs and neuropsychiatric AEs including agitation, akathisia, depression, 
      depression/agitated depression, drowsiness/somnolence, insomnia, and parkinsonism in 
      both adjusted and unadjusted analyses (p < 0.05 for each). Deutetrabenazine had a 
      significantly lower rate of dose reduction or dose reduction/suspension in the 
      unadjusted and adjusted analyses (p < 0.001 for each). Deutetrabenazine resulted in 
      numerically more mild AEs, such as diarrhea and coughing; however, these results 
      were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This indirect treatment comparison 
      demonstrates that for the treatment of HD chorea, deutetrabenazine has a favorable 
      tolerability profile compared to tetrabenazine. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01795859 and NCT00219804.

TI  - Indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of medical therapies for an overactive bladder.
PG  - 1824-1831
LID - 10.1002/nau.23189 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a chronic and prevalent condition 
      which has a negative impact on Quality of Life. The National Institute of Clinical 
      Excellence issued two documents which give slightly varying algorithms of 
      pharmacotherapy for OAB, offering mirabegron as a possible treatment in certain 
      circumstances. In the absence of trials involving a direct comparison of therapies, 
      an indirect comparison can provide useful information on the difference in treatment 
      effects between competing interventions. OBJECTIVE: To compare effectiveness of 
      available medical therapies for OAB using Bucher indirect treatment comparison (ITC) 
      model. METHODS: A systematic literature search identified randomised controlled 
      trials (RCT) assessing effectiveness of drugs for OAB versus placebo. Then indirect 
      comparisons of the treatments effects were made, preserving the randomisation of the 
      originally assigned patient groups, using Bucher method. MAIN RESULTS: 25 RCTs met 
      inclusion criteria. In keeping with ITC method validity, four assessments were 
      undertaken of mirabegron against anticholinergics, which were number of incontinence 
      episodes, micturition episodes, urgency episodes in 24 h and volume of micturition. 
      This indirect treatment analysis suggests that mirabegron is as effective as 
      anticholinergics in managing of OAB, except for solifenacin which appears to be 
      superior. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that work looking into treatment 
      choice should be individualized to patient characteristics rather than fitting 
      patients to a treatment. Further work is required to identify what patient 
      characteristics may be crucial and indicate that studies exploring the most 
      effective sequence of managing treatment naïve patients and those with refractory 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease. Patients with both 
      eosinophilic and allergic asthma phenotypes may be eligible for treatment with 
      mepolizumab and omalizumab. Evidence on the relative effectiveness of these 
      treatments in this 'overlap' population would be informative for clinical and payer 
      decision making. METHODS: A systematic literature review and indirect treatment 
      comparison (Bayesian framework) were performed to assess the comparative 
      effectiveness and tolerability of mepolizumab and omalizumab, as add-ons to standard 
      of care. Studies included in the primary analysis were double-blind, randomized 
      controlled trials, ≥12 weeks' duration enrolling patients with severe asthma with a 
      documented exacerbation history and receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus 
      ≥1 additional controller. Two populations were examined: patients potentially 
      eligible for 1) both treatments (Overlap population) and 2) either treatment (Trial 
      population). RESULTS: In the Overlap population, no differences between treatments 
      in clinically significant exacerbations and exacerbations requiring hospitalization 
      were found, although trends favored mepolizumab (rate ratio [RR]:0.66 [95% credible 
      intervals (Crl):0.37,1.19]; 0.19[0.02,2.32], respectively). In the Trial population, 
      mepolizumab treatment produced greater reductions in clinically significant 
      exacerbations (RR:0.63 [95% CrI:0.45,0.89]) but not exacerbations requiring 
      hospitalization compared with omalizumab (RR:0.58 [95% Crl: 0.16,2.13]), although 
      the trend favored mepolizumab. Both treatments had broadly comparable effects on 
      lung function, and similar tolerability profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst this analysis 
      has limitations due to a restricted evidence base and residual heterogeneity, it 
      showed that in patients with severe asthma, mepolizumab seems to be at least as 
      effective as omalizumab and that the tolerability profiles of the two treatments did 
      not meaningfully differentiate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of pain and disability, 
      resulting in a major socioeconomic impact. The Cochrane Review which examined the 
      effect of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for chronic LBP concluded that SMT is 
      moderately effective, but was based on conventional meta-analysis of aggregate data. 
      The use of individual participant data (IPD) from trials allows for a more precise 
      estimate of the treatment effect and has the potential to identify moderators and/or 
      mediators. The aim is (1) to assess the overall treatment effect of SMT for primary 
      and secondary outcomes in adults with chronic LBP, (2) to determine possible 
      moderation of baseline characteristics on treatment effect, (3) to identify 
      characteristics of intervention (e.g., manipulation/mobilization) that influence the 
      treatment effect, and (4) to identify mediators of treatment effects. METHODS: All 
      trials included in the Cochrane Review on SMT for chronic LBP will be included which 
      were published after the year 2000, and the search will be updated. No restrictions 
      will be placed on the type of comparison or size of the study. Primary outcomes are 
      pain intensity and physical functioning. A dataset will be compiled consisting of 
      individual trials and variables included according to a predefined coding scheme. 
      Variables to be included are descriptive of characteristics of the study, treatment, 
      comparison, participant characteristics, and outcomes at all follow-up periods. A 
      one-stage approach with a mixed model technique based on the intention-to-treat 
      principle will be used for the analysis. Subsequent analyses will focus on treatment 
      effect moderators and mediators. DISCUSSION: We will analyze IPD for LBP trials in 
      which SMT is one of the interventions. IPD meta-analysis has been shown to be more 
      reliable and valid than aggregate data meta-analysis, although this difference might 
      also be attributed to the number of studies that can be used or the amount of data 
      that can be utilized. Therefore, this project may identify important gaps in our 
      knowledge with respect to prognostic factors of treatment effects. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

TI  - LABA/LAMA combination in COPD: a meta-analysis on the duration of treatment.
LID - 160043 [pii]
LID - 10.1183/16000617.0043-2016 [doi]
AB  - When there are no randomised clinical trials directly comparing all relevant 
      treatment options, an indirect treatment comparison via meta-analysis of the 
      available clinical evidence is an acceptable alternative. However, meta-analyses may 
      be very misleading if not adequately performed. Here, we propose and validate a 
      simple and effective approach to meta-analysis for exploring the effectiveness of 
      long-acting β(2)-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) fixed-dose 
      combinations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.14 articles with 20 329 
      patients (combinations n=9292; monocomponents n=11 037) were included in this study. 
      LABA/LAMA combinations were always more effective than the monocomponents in terms 
      of the improvement in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s, transition dyspnoea 
      index and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores after 3, 6 and 12 months of 
      treatment. No significant publication bias was identified. Significant discrepancies 
      with previous network meta-analyses have been found, with overall differences 
      ranging from 26.7% to 43.3%.Results from previous network meta-analyses were 
      misleading because no adequate attention was given to formulating the review 
      question, specifying eligibility criteria, correctly identifying studies, collecting 
      appropriate information and deciding what it would be pharmacologically relevant to 
      analyse. The real gradient of effectiveness of LABA/LAMA fixed-dose combinations 
      remains an unmet medical need; however, it can be investigated indirectly using a 
      high-quality meta-analytic approach.

TI  - Cost Effectiveness of Insulin Degludec Plus Liraglutide (IDegLira) in a Fixed 
      Combination for Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Sweden.
PG  - 237-248
LID - 10.1007/s40258-016-0301-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are a 
      priority group for intensified therapy without weight gain and with low risk of 
      hypoglycaemia. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost effectiveness of insulin 
      degludec plus liraglutide (IDegLira, Xultophy(®)) compared with six potential 
      intensification treatment options for patients with T2DM that is uncontrolled with 
      basal insulin. METHODS: The Swedish Institute for Health Economics (IHE) Cohort 
      Model of Type 2 Diabetes was used with Swedish input data, a 40-year time frame and 
      a societal perspective. The comparators for treatment intensification included 
      insulin glargine, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, insulin aspart plus 
      either glargine or NPH, and liraglutide plus either glargine or NPH. Clinical data 
      for all comparators (except NPH insulin) were based on an indirect treatment 
      comparison of several studies. Prices were obtained from the 2014 Swedish Dental and 
      Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (Tandvårds- och läkemedelsförmånsverket [TLV]) 
      database, and utility values were obtained from published studies. Sensitivity 
      analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
      (ICER) were Swedish krona (SEK) 70,000 or lower per quality-adjusted life-year 
      (QALY). IDegLira compared with intensified basal insulin showed an ICER of SEK 
      28,000 per QALY versus insulin glargine, SEK70,000 per QALY versus NPH insulin and 
      SEK 60,000 per QALY versus NPH insulin plus liraglutide. IDegLira was dominant over 
      insulin glargine plus liraglutide and insulin aspart plus insulin glargine or NPH 
      insulin. Results were driven by the difference in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) 
      reduction between treatments, as confirmed by sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: 
      IDegLira is estimated to be a cost-effective treatment in Sweden compared with 
      commonly used intensification treatments for patients with T2DM uncontrolled with 
      basal insulin.

TI  - Indirect Treatment Comparisons of Ibrutinib Versus Physician's Choice and Idelalisib 
      Plus Ofatumumab in Patients With Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
PG  - 178-189.e5

AB  - PURPOSE: Treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic 
      lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL) are limited. Until recently, few effective treatment 
      options existed, and even with the advent of new agents, studies evaluating 
      comparative efficacy are scarce. In the Ibrutinib Versus Ofatumumab in Patients With 
      Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE) Phase III study, 
      ibrutinib, an oral, once-a-day, first-in-class covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor, improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) 
      compared with ofatumumab (PFS hazard ratio [HR] = 0.106 and OS HR = 0.369 [adjusted 
      for crossover] at a median of 16 months' follow-up). We sought to establish the 
      relative efficacy of ibrutinib versus other treatment options for patients with R/R 
      CLL using indirect comparison methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was 
      conducted to identify clinical trials sharing a common treatment arm with the 
      RESONATE Phase III trial such that a network meta-analysis or indirect treatment 
      comparisons (ITCs) could be conducted. Two trials were identified, each using the 
      same comparator (ofatumumab) as the RESONATE study. Two pairwise ITCs were conducted 
      using the Bucher method to establish the relative treatment efficacy of ibrutinib 
      versus (1) idelalisib plus ofatumumab in the first study and (2) physician's choice, 
      defined as a mix of therapies commonly used in R/R CLL, in the second study. Odds 
      ratios for these ITCs were calculated for overall response rate (ORR) and HRs for 
      PFS and OS. FINDINGS: A strong and consistent trend of superiority for ibrutinib was 
      observed via these ITC models with idelalisib plus ofatumumab and physician's choice 
      for ORR, PFS, and OS. Ibrutinib revealed prolonged PFS and OS versus comparators 
      (PFS HR = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.11; and OS HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.54), physician's 
      choice (PFS HR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25-0.66; and OS HR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.23-1.08), and 
      idelalisib plus ofatumumab. These findings were robust and continued to favor 
      ibrutinib when adjusting (where appropriate) for underlying differences in patient 
      population between the trials. Some trial differences were not accounted for in the 
      models and thus some limitations remain; however, consistency of results supports 
      the overall findings. IMPLICATIONS: In a randomized Phase III study, ibrutinib 
      significantly improved ORR, PFS, and OS in patients with R/R CLL versus ofatumumab. 
      In ITC models that used ofatumumab as the common comparator, ibrutinib appears to 
      have higher ORR and longer PFS and OS versus both idelalisib plus ofatumumab and 
      physician's choice. In the absence of head-to-head studies and taking into 
      consideration inherent limitations of ITCs, these models provide useful estimates of 
      comparative efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with a high 
      mortality rate and the fastest growing global incidence rate of all malignancies. 
      The introduction of BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations has yielded significant 
      increases in PFS and OS for melanoma. However, at present, no direct comparisons 
      between different BRAF/MEK combinations have been conducted. In light of this, an 
      indirect treatment comparison was performed between two BRAF/MEK inhibitor 
      combination therapies for metastatic melanoma, dabrafenib plus trametinib and 
      vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, in order to understand the relative efficacy and 
      toxicity profiles of these therapies. METHODS: A systematic literature search 
      identified two randomized trials as suitable for indirect comparison: the coBRIM 
      trial of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib versus vemurafenib and the COMBI-v trial of 
      dabrafenib plus trametinib versus vemurafenib. The comparison followed the method of 
      Bucher et al. and analyzed both efficacy (overall survival [OS], progression-free 
      survival [PFS], and overall response rate [ORR]) and safety outcomes (adverse events 
      [AEs]). RESULTS: The indirect comparison revealed similar efficacy outcomes between 
      both therapies, with no statistically significant difference between therapies for 
      OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 - 1.30), PFS (HR 1.05, 
      95% CI 0.79 - 1.40), or ORR (risk ratio [RR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 - 1.10). Dabrafenib 
      plus trametinib differed significantly from vemurafenib plus cobimetinib with regard 
      to the incidence of treatment-related AE (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 - 0.97), any AE grade 
      ≥3 (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 - 0.85) or dose interruption/modification (RR 0.77, 95% CI 
      0.60 - 0.99). Several categories of AEs occurred significantly more frequently with 
      vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, while some occurred significantly more frequently with 
      dabrafenib plus trametinib. For severe AEs (grade 3 or above), four occurred 
      significantly more frequently with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib and no severe AE 
      occurred significantly more frequently with dabrafenib plus trametinib. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This indirect treatment comparison suggested that dabrafenib plus trametinib had 
      comparable efficacy to vemurafenib plus cobimetinib but was associated with reduced 
      adverse events.

TI  - Relative Efficacy of Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor, Dacarbazine, 
      and Glycoprotein 100 in Metastatic Melanoma: An Indirect Treatment Comparison.
PG  - 495-512
LID - 10.1007/s12325-016-0464-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Advances in the treatment of metastatic melanoma have been achieved in 
      recent years: immunotherapies and targeted therapies have demonstrated survival 
      benefits over older agents such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
      (GM-CSF), dacarbazine, and glycoprotein peptide vaccine (gp100) in pivotal phase 3 
      trials. It is important to compare therapies to guide the treatment decision-making 
      process, and establishing the relationship between older agents can strengthen the 
      networks of evidence for newer therapies. We report the outcome of an indirect 
      comparison of GM-CSF, dacarbazine, and gp100 in metastatic melanoma through 
      meta-analysis of absolute treatment effect. METHODS: A systematic literature review 
      identified trials for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A valid network meta-analysis 
      was not feasible: treatment-specific meta-analysis was conducted. A published 
      algorithm was used to adjust overall survival estimates from trials of GM-CSF, 
      dacarbazine, and gp100 for heterogeneity in baseline prognostic factors. Survival 
      estimates were compared in three patient groups: stage IIIB-IV M1c, 
      stage IIIB-IV M1a, and stage IV M1b/c. RESULTS: One trial of GM-CSF, four of 
      dacarbazine, and one of gp100 were included in the analysis. After adjusting for 
      differences in baseline prognostic factors, median overall survival (OS) in all 
      patient groups was longer for those receiving GM-CSF than for those receiving 
      dacarbazine or gp100. The observed survival over time for GM-CSF was similar to the 
      adjusted survival for dacarbazine and greater than for gp100 in all patient groups. 
      CONCLUSION: The relative treatment effect of GM-CSF, dacarbazine, and gp100 has been 
      reliably estimated by adjusting for differences in baseline prognostic factors. 
      Results suggest that OS with GM-CSF is at least as good as with dacarbazine and 
      greater than with gp100. Given the role of these agents as controls in phase 3 
      trials of new immunotherapies and targeted agents, these results can be used to 
      contextualize the efficacy of newer therapies. FUNDING: Amgen Inc.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of different doses of evolocumab in reducing low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels: A meta-analysis.
PG  - 541-547
AB  - Evolocumab has been considered as an efficacious, safe and promising therapeutic 
      modality for hypercholesterolemia and is associated with cardiovascular diseases. 
      The efficacy and safety of two different doses of evolocumab were evaluated and the 
      safety of evolocumab was compared with that of a placebo and ezetimibe. PubMed and 
      EMBASE databases were searched and randomized controlled trials that examined the 
      effect and safety of evolomucab compared with a placebo and ezetimibe were 
      retrieved. Two authors independently performed article reviews and study quality 
      evaluations. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a fixed or random-effects model 
      [95% confidence intervals (CIs)]. In the direct comparison, a significant reduction 
      was observed in the muscle-associated events compared with ezetimibe [OR=0.54 (95% 
      CI, 0.31-0.93); P (Z)=0.03, P (Q)=0.43, I(2)=0%]. In the adjusted indirect 
      comparison of evolocumab 140 mg Q2W vs. evolocumab 420 mg Q4W, no significant 
      differences in efficacy [OR=1.04 (95% CI, 0.55-1.99); P (Z)=0.90] or adverse events 
      [OR=1.08 (95% CI, 0.66-1.74); P (Z)=0.76] were identified. The funnel plots of these 
      direct comparison studies indicated that there was no publication bias. The results 
      of this meta-analysis demonstrate that evolocumab significantly reduced low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and no difference was noted between evolocumab 140 
      mg Q2W and evolocumab 420 mg Q4W. Furthermore, evolocumab had fewer 
      muscle-associated events than ezetimibe.

TI  - A single-arm trial indirect comparison investigation: a proof-of-concept method to 
      predict venous leg ulcer healing time for a new acellular synthetic matrix matched 
      to standard care control.
PG  - 729-741
LID - 10.1111/iwj.12687 [doi]
AB  - To compare data on time to healing from two separate cohorts: one treated with a new 
      acellular synthetic matrix plus standard care (SC) and one matched from four large 
      UK pragmatic, randomised controlled trials [venous leg ulcer (VLU) evidence 
      network]. We introduce a new proof-of-concept strategy to a VLU clinical evidence 
      network, propensity score matching and sensitivity analysis to predict the 
      feasibility of the new acellular synthetic matrix plus SC for success in future 
      randomised, controlled clinical trials. Prospective data on chronic VLUs from a 
      safety and effectiveness study on an acellular synthetic matrix conducted in one 
      wound centre in the UK (17 patients) and three wound centres in Australia (36 
      patients) were compared retrospectively to propensity score-matched data from 
      patients with comparable leg ulcer disease aetiology, age, baseline ulcer area, 
      ulcer duration, multi-layer compression bandaging and majority of care completed in 
      specialist wound centres (average of 1 visit per week), with the outcome measures at 
      comparable follow-up periods from patients enrolled in four prospective, 
      multicentre, pragmatic, randomised studies of venous ulcers in the UK (the 
      comparison group; VLU evidence network). Analysis using Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
      showed a mean healing time of 73·1 days for ASM plus SC (ASM) treated ulcers in 
      comparison with 83·5 days for comparison group ulcers treated with SC alone (Log 
      rank test, χ(2) 5·779, P = 0·016) within 12 weeks. Sensitivity analysis indicates 
      that an unobserved covariate would have to change the odds of healing for SC by a 
      factor of 1·1 to impact the baseline results. Results from this study predict a 
      significant effect on healing time when using a new ASM as an adjunct to SC in the 
      treatment of non-healing venous ulcers in the UK, but results are sensitive to 
      unobserved covariates that may be important in healing time comparison.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine which procedure, aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a 
      sutureless or rapid-deployment prosthesis (SL-AVR) or transcatheter aortic valve 
      implantation (TAVI), achieves better perioperative survival for severe aortic 
      stenosis (AS), we conducted direct-comparison meta-analyses (DC-MAs) and an adjusted 
      indirect-comparison meta-analysis (IDC-MA). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through April 2016. Eligible 
      studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity-score matched (PSM) 
      studies. We performed a DC-MA-[A] of SL-AVR versus TAVI, a DC-MA-[B] of SL-AVR 
      versus conventional AVR (C-AVR), and a DC-MA-[C] TAVI versus C-AVR. Then, we 
      computed a IDC-MA-[A'] of TAVI versus SL-AVR from the results of the DC-MA-[B] and 
      the DC-MA-[C]. RESULTS: We identified 6 RCTs and 30 PSM studies enrolling a total of 
      15,887 patients. The 3 DC-MAs demonstrated significantly lower perioperative (30-day 
      or in-hospital) all-cause mortality after SL-AVR than after TAVI (odds ratio [OR], 
      0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28 to 0.80; p=0.005) and no significant 
      differences between SL-AVR and C-AVR (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.94; p=0.81) and 
      between TAVI and C-AVR (1.07; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.27; p=0.45). The computed 
      IDC-MA-[A'] indicated no significant difference in mortality between SL-AVR and TAVI 
      (1.01; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.86). Combining the results of the DC-MA-[A] and IDC-MA [A'] 
      showed significantly lower mortality after SL-AVR than after TAVI (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 
      0.44 to 0.97; p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe AS, SL-AVR may achieve 
      better perioperative survival than TAVI.

AB  - Because of the methodological complexity of network meta-analyses (NMAs), NMAs may 
      be more vulnerable to methodological risks than conventional pair-wise 
      meta-analysis. Our study aims to investigate epidemiology characteristics, 
      conduction of literature search, methodological quality and reporting of statistical 
      analysis process in the field of cancer based on PRISMA extension statement and 
      modified AMSTAR checklist. We identified and included 102 NMAs in the field of 
      cancer. 61 NMAs were conducted using a Bayesian framework. Of them, more than half 
      of NMAs did not report assessment of convergence (60.66%). Inconsistency was 
      assessed in 27.87% of NMAs. Assessment of heterogeneity in traditional meta-analyses 
      was more common (42.62%) than in NMAs (6.56%). Most of NMAs did not report 
      assessment of similarity (86.89%) and did not used GRADE tool to assess quality of 
      evidence (95.08%). 43 NMAs were adjusted indirect comparisons, the methods used were 
      described in 53.49% NMAs. Only 4.65% NMAs described the details of handling of multi 
      group trials and 6.98% described the methods of similarity assessment. The median 
      total AMSTAR-score was 8.00 (IQR: 6.00-8.25). Methodological quality and reporting 
      of statistical analysis did not substantially differ by selected general 
      characteristics. Overall, the quality of NMAs in the field of cancer was generally 
      acceptable.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of Dapagliflozin versus Acarbose as a Monotherapy in Type 2 
      Diabetes in China.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus 
      acarbose as monotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) in China. METHODS: The Cardiff Diabetes Model, an economic model designed to 
      evaluate the cost-effectiveness of comparator therapies in diabetes was used to 
      simulate disease progression and estimate the long-term effect of treatments on 
      patients. Systematic literature reviews, hospital surveys, meta-analysis and 
      indirect treatment comparison were conducted to obtain model-required patient 
      profiles, clinical data and costs. Health insurance costs (2015¥) were estimated 
      over 40 years from a healthcare payer perspective. Univariate and probabilistic 
      sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The model predicted that dapagliflozin 
      had lower incidences of cardiovascular events, hypoglycemia and mortality events, 
      was associated with a mean incremental benefit of 0.25 quality-adjusted life-years 
      (QALYs) and with a lower cost of ¥8,439 compared with acarbose. This resulted in a 
      cost saving of ¥33,786 per QALY gained with dapagliflozin. Sensitivity analyses 
      determined that the results are robust. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin is dominant 
      compared with acarbose as monotherapy for Chinese T2DM patients, with a little QALY 
      gain and lower costs. Dapagliflozin offers a well-tolerated and cost-effective 
      alternative medication for treatment-naive patients in China, and may have a direct 
      impact in reducing the disease burden of T2DM.

TI  - Lenvatinib for the treatment of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid 
      carcinoma: a systematic review and indirect comparison with sorafenib.
PG  - 1303-1309
AB  - Thyroid carcinoma is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy, with an increasing 
      incidence over the past decades. Treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer consists 
      of surgery followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation of the thyroid remnant, and 
      TSH suppression. Among new therapeutic solutions for patients with advanced RR-DTC 
      stage, the most promising seem to be sorafenib and lenvatinib, up to now considered 
      to be orphan drugs. Areas covered: We performed a systematic review of medical 
      databases to collect all eligible clinical trials referring to the topic of our 
      analysis. Due to the lack of direct clinical trials comparing the drugs we used an 
      adjusted indirect comparison of efficacy and safety of tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
      (TKIs) by Bucher method. Expert commentary: Lenvatinib and sorafenib are drugs with 
      strong evidence on efficacy in treatment of RR-DTC. Based on the currently available 
      clinical data lenvatinib occurred more efficacious then sorafenib in RR-DTC therapy. 
      Safety profile of the drugs was acceptable and comparative. Kinase inhibitors 
      constitute a substantial progress in treatment of advanced thyroid cancer, have 
      achieved long-lasting response and have improved survival without progress of the 
      disease. In the near future we will deal with a range of therapeutic options for 
      patients.

TI  - A common reference-based indirect comparison meta-analysis of eslicarbazepine versus 
      lacosamide as add on treatments for focal epilepsy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) and lacosamide (LCM) have recently emerged 
      as add-on treatments in patients with focal epilepsy experiencing seizures despite 
      adequate monotherapy. Both drugs enhance slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium 
      channels. To date no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has directly compared ESL 
      with LCM as add-on treatments for focal epilepsy. Our aim was to indirectly compare 
      the efficacy of ESL and LCM used as add-on treatments in patients with focal 
      epilepsy using common reference-based indirect comparison meta-analysis. METHODS: We 
      systematically searched RCTs in which ESL or LCM has been used as add-on treatment 
      in patients with focal epilepsy and compared with placebo. Following outcomes were 
      considered: ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency; seizure freedom; treatment 
      withdrawal for any reason; ≥25% increase in seizure frequency. Random-effects 
      Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses were performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for the 
      efficacy of ESL or LCM versus placebo. Adjusted indirect comparisons were then made 
      between ESL and LCM using the obtained results, and comparing the minimum and the 
      highest effective recommended daily dose of each drug. RESULTS: Eight studies were 
      included. Indirect comparisons adjusted for dose-effect showed no difference between 
      ESL and LCM for responder rate, seizure freedom, and withdrawal rates. We could not 
      assess increase in seizure frequency due to lack of data. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect 
      comparisons failed to find a significant difference in efficacy between add-on ESL 
      and LCM in patients with focal epilepsy. Direct head-to-head clinical trials 
      comparing ESL with LCM as add-on antiepileptic treatment are required to confirm 
      these results.

TI  - Bucher's indirect comparison of daylight photodynamic therapy with methyl 
      aminolevulinate cream versus diclofenac plus hyaluronic acid gel for the treatment 
      of multiple actinic keratosis.
PG  - 487-492
AB  - Actinic keratosis (AK) is a pre-cancerous condition characterised by patches of 
      thick, scaly skin developing on sun-exposed areas of the body. When multiple AKs 
      develop on severely photodamaged skin, commonly used treatments include photodynamic 
      therapy and diclofenac plus hyaluronic acid gel (DHA). Methyl aminolevulinate 
      daylight photodynamic therapy (MAL DL-PDT) is an alternative to conventional 
      photodynamic therapy (MAL c-PDT). Trials have indicated that MAL DL-PDT is as 
      effective as MAL c-PDT but reduces treatment-related pain and dermatological side 
      effects. To indirectly compare between MAL DL-PDT and DHA in patients with AK. A 
      total of three randomised trials were collected using a systematic literature 
      review. An adjusted indirect comparison was conducted on complete lesion response 
      rate at 12 weeks. The data indicated that mild lesions, moderate lesions, and mild 
      and moderate lesions treated with MAL DL-PDT were more than four times more likely 
      to undergo a complete response than lesions treated with DHA at 12 weeks, with ORs 
      ranging from 4.23 to 4.81. Results were all statistically significant. This is the 
      first indirect comparison demonstrating the effectiveness of MAL-PDT over DHA for 
      the treatment of AK, and further research is needed to assess the long-term efficacy 
      of these interventions (i.e. six months and beyond), as well as safety and 
      patient-reported outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obinutuzumab combined with chlorambucil (GClb) has shown to be superior 
      to rituximab combined with chlorambucil (RClb) and chlorambucil (Clb) in newly 
      diagnosed patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). This study evaluates 
      the cost-effectiveness per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of GClb 
      compared to RClb, Clb, and ofatumumab plus chlorambucil (OClb) in The Netherlands. 
      METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of GClb, 
      RClb, Clb and other treatments in the United Kingdom. A country adaptation was made 
      to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these therapies in The Netherlands using Dutch 
      unit costs and Dutch data sources for background mortality and post-progression 
      survival. RESULTS: An incremental gain of 1.06 and 0.64 QALYs was estimated for GClb 
      compared to Clb and RClb respectively, at additional costs of €23,208 and €7254 per 
      patient. Corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were €21,823 
      and €11,344 per QALY. Indirect treatment comparisons showed an incremental gain 
      varying from 0.44 to 0.77 QALYs for GClb compared to OClb and additional costs 
      varying from €7041 to €5028 per patient. The ICER varied from €6556 to €16,180 per 
      QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: GClb 
      appeared to be a cost-effective treatment strategy compared to RClb, OClb and Clb.

TI  - Economic Evaluations of Pharmaceuticals Granted a Marketing Authorisation Without 
      the Results of Randomised Trials: A Systematic Review and Taxonomy.
PG  - 163-176
LID - 10.1007/s40273-016-0460-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmaceuticals are usually granted a marketing authorisation on the 
      basis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Occasionally the efficacy of a 
      treatment is assessed without a randomised comparator group (either active or 
      placebo). OBJECTIVE: To identify and develop a taxonomic account of economic 
      modelling approaches for pharmaceuticals licensed without RCT data. METHODS: We 
      searched PubMed, the websites of UK health technology assessment bodies and the 
      International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Scientific 
      Presentations Database for assessments of treatments granted a marketing 
      authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency 
      from January 1999 to May 2014 without RCT data (74 indications). The outcome of 
      interest was the approach to modelling efficacy data. RESULTS: Fifty-one unique 
      models were identified in 29 peer-reviewed articles, 30 health technology 
      appraisals, and 15 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research 
      abstracts concerning 30 indications (44 indications had not been modelled). We noted 
      the high rate of non-submission to health technology assessment agencies (28/98). 
      The majority of models (43/51) were based on 'historical controls'-comparisons to 
      previous meta-analysis or pooling of trials (5), individual trials (16), 
      registries/case series (15), or expert opinion (7). Other approaches used the 
      patient as their own control, performed threshold analysis, assumed time on 
      treatment was added to overall survival, or performed cost-minimisation analysis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in the quality and approach of models 
      constructed for drugs granted a marketing authorisation without a RCT. The most 
      common approach is of a naive comparison to historical data (using other 
      trials/registry data as a control group), which has considerable scope for bias.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of published studies to 
      directly compare intravenous (IV) levetiracetam (LEV) with IV phenytoin (PHT) or IV 
      valproate (VPA) as second-line treatment of status epilepticus (SE), to indirectly 
      compare intravenous IV LEV with IV VPA using common reference-based indirect 
      comparison meta-analysis, and to verify whether results of indirect comparisons are 
      consistent with results of head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directly 
      comparing IV LEV with IV VPA. METHODS: Random-effects Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses 
      to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for efficacy and safety of LEV versus VPA and LEV or VPA 
      versus PHT were used. Adjusted indirect comparisons between LEV and VPA were used. 
      RESULTS: Two RCTs comparing LEV with PHT (144 episodes of SE) and 3 RCTs comparing 
      VPA with PHT (227 episodes of SE) were included. Direct comparisons showed no 
      difference in clinical seizure cessation, neither between VPA and PHT (OR: 1.07; 95% 
      CI: 0.57 to 2.03) nor between LEV and PHT (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.50 to 2.79). Indirect 
      comparisons showed no difference between LEV and VPA for clinical seizure cessation 
      (OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.45 to 2.97). Results of indirect comparisons are consistent 
      with results of a recent RCT directly comparing LEV with VPA. CONCLUSION: The 
      absence of a statistically significant difference in direct and indirect comparisons 
      is due to the lack of sufficient statistical power to detect a difference. 
      Conducting a RCT that has not enough people to detect a clinically important 
      difference or to estimate an effect with sufficient precision can be regarded a 
      waste of time and resources and may raise several ethical concerns, especially in 
      RCT on SE.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison between 
      delayed-release dimethyl fumarate and fingolimod for the treatment of multiple 
      sclerosis.
PG  - 175-183
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2016.1248380 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF; also known as gastro-resistant 
      DMF) and fingolimod are approved oral disease-modifying treatments for 
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. In phase 3 trials, DMF (DEFINE/CONFIRM) and 
      fingolimod (FREEDOMS/FREEDOMS II) resulted in significant reductions in clinical and 
      magnetic resonance imaging activity, with acceptable safety profiles. Direct 
      comparisons of these treatments are not possible due to a lack of head-to-head 
      trials. We compared 2 year efficacy of DMF versus fingolimod at the approved dosage 
      using a matching-adjusted indirect approach. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individual 
      patient data from DEFINE and CONFIRM, and aggregate data from FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS 
      II, were pooled and compared using the matching-adjusted in-direct method. To 
      account for cross-trial differences, data from trials with available individual 
      patient data were adjusted to match aggregate data (i.e. average patient 
      characteristics) from trials without patient-level data. Data from DMF-treated 
      patients were weighted such that average baseline characteristics matched those of 
      fingolimod-treated patients. After matching, weighted treatment outcomes for 
      DMF-treated patients (240 mg twice daily) were compared with summary outcomes for 
      fingolimod-treated patients (0.5 mg once daily). All comparison results of DMF 
      versus fingolimod used fingolimod as the reference. RESULTS: After matching, 
      baseline characteristics were balanced between DMF and fingolimod. At year 2, the 
      efficacy of DMF was similar to that of fingolimod for annualized relapse rate (rate 
      ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.11 [0.88, 1.40]), 12 week confirmed 
      disability progression (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.90 [0.63, 1.29]), and Multiple 
      Sclerosis Functional Composite (mean difference [95% CI]: 0.04 [-0.05, 0.13]). For 
      patient-reported outcomes (EuroQoL 5-Dimensions questionnaire), the mean differences 
      (95% CI) were 0.05 (0.01, 0.08) for utility score and 3.22 (0.58, 5.86) for visual 
      analog scale score, significantly favoring DMF. There was no significant difference 
      in the percentage of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) for DMF 
      versus fingolimod among matching-adjusted patients with complete NEDA data: rate 
      ratio (95% CI): 0.92 (0.51, 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: Using the matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison approach, the efficacy of DMF and fingolimod were similar on all clinical 
      outcomes, while patient-reported outcomes showed greater benefit with DMF. Study 
      limitations include possible confounding from unobserved/unknown differences between 
      trials, and trial length may have been insufficient to detect significant 
      differences on disability progression. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00420212 
      (DEFINE); NCT00451451 (CONFIRM); NCT00289978 (FREEDOMS); NCT00355134 (FREEDOMS II).

PG  - 131
LID - 131
AB  - BACKGROUND: Network meta-analysis methods, which are an extension of the standard 
      pair-wise synthesis framework, allow for the simultaneous comparison of multiple 
      interventions and consideration of the entire body of evidence in a single 
      statistical model. There are well-established advantages to using individual patient 
      data to perform network meta-analysis and methods for network meta-analysis of 
      individual patient data have already been developed for dichotomous and 
      time-to-event data. This paper describes appropriate methods for the network 
      meta-analysis of individual patient data on continuous outcomes. METHODS: This paper 
      introduces and describes network meta-analysis of individual patient data models for 
      continuous outcomes using the analysis of covariance framework. Comparisons are made 
      between this approach and change score and final score only approaches, which are 
      frequently used and have been proposed in the methodological literature. A 
      motivating example on the effectiveness of acupuncture for chronic pain is used to 
      demonstrate the methods. Individual patient data on 28 randomised controlled trials 
      were synthesised. Consistency of endpoints across the evidence base was obtained 
      through standardisation and mapping exercises. RESULTS: Individual patient data 
      availability avoided the use of non-baseline-adjusted models, allowing instead for 
      analysis of covariance models to be applied and thus improving the precision of 
      treatment effect estimates while adjusting for baseline imbalance. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      network meta-analysis of individual patient data using the analysis of covariance 
      approach is advocated to be the most appropriate modelling approach for network 
      meta-analysis of continuous outcomes, particularly in the presence of baseline 
      imbalance. Further methods developments are required to address the challenge of 
      analysing aggregate level data in the presence of baseline imbalance.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of brivaracetam compared to lacosamide, eslicarbazepine 
      acetate, and perampanel as adjunctive treatments in uncontrolled focal epilepsy: 
      Results of an indirect comparison meta-analysis of RCTs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brivaracetam (BRV), eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL), lacosamide (LCM), and 
      perampanel (PER) have been recently marketed as adjunctive treatments for focal 
      onset seizures. To date, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has directly compared 
      BRV with ESL, LCM, or PER. PURPOSE: To compare BRV with the other add-on AEDs in 
      patients with uncontrolled focal epilepsy, estimating their efficacy and 
      tolerability through an adjusted, common-reference based indirect comparison 
      meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched RCTs in which add-on treatment 
      with ESL or LCM in patients with focal onset seizures have been compared with 
      placebo. Efficacy and tolerability outcomes were considered. Random-effects 
      Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses were performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for the 
      efficacy of BRV, LCM, ESL, or PER versus placebo. Adjusted indirect comparisons were 
      then made between BRV and the other three AEDs using the obtained results, comparing 
      the minimum and the highest effective recommended daily dose of each drug. RESULTS: 
      Seventeen RCTs, with a total of 4971 patients were included. After adjusting for 
      dose-effects, indirect comparisons showed no difference between BRV and LCM, ESL, or 
      PER for responder rate and seizure freedom. Lower adverse events were observed with 
      high dose BRV compared to high dose ESL or PER, but no difference was found in 
      withdrawing because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons do not 
      demonstrate a significant difference in efficacy between add-on BRV and LCM, ESL, or 
      PER in focal epilepsy, and might suggest a better tolerability of BRV than ESL, and 
      possibly also PER, at the highest effective recommended dose.

AB  - A systematic review and critical evaluation of randomized trial evidence for 
      oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-containing regimens in patients with advanced pancreatic 
      cancer previously treated with gemcitabine has not yet been published. We conducted 
      a comparative systematic review of randomized trials evaluating oxaliplatin- or 
      irinotecan-based therapies in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer previously 
      treated with gemcitabine to assess trial similarity and the feasibility of 
      performing an indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Studies were identified through 
      PubMed and key oncology conference abstracts. The following trials met our criteria: 
      NAPOLI-1 (nanoliposomal irinotecan [nal-IRI] or nal-IRI+5-fluorouracil 
      [5-FU]/leucovorin [LV] vs 5-FU/LV), CONKO-003 (oxaliplatin+5-FU/LV [OFF] vs 
      5-FU/LV), PANCREOX (oxaliplatin+5-FU/LV [mFOLFOX6] vs 5-FU/LV), and Yoo et al. 
      (2009) (irinotecan+5-FU/LV [mFOLFIRI3] vs mFOLFOX). Fundamental differences were 
      identified in study design (i.e., number of study sites, number of countries), 
      patient (i.e., locally advanced vs metastatic disease, stratification variables, 
      prior and subsequent treatments) and treatment (i.e., regimens, dose intensity) 
      characteristics, and primary and secondary outcomes (i.e., primary vs secondary 
      outcomes, overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS]) among the 4 
      included trials. Our comparative review demonstrated significant dissimilarity 
      across trials, which precluded conducting an ITC. In the absence of head-to-head 
      nal-IRI- and/or oxaliplatin-based therapy trials, clinicians are advised to 
      interpret these studies separately within the context of their individual patient 
      population.

TI  - Interchangeability between first-line generic antiretroviral products prequalified 
      by WHO using adjusted indirect comparisons.
PG  - 135-144
LID - 10.3851/IMP3089 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The scaling-up of access to antiretroviral therapy, particularly in low- 
      to middle-income countries, was facilitated by the introduction and widespread use 
      of generic antiretroviral medicines and fixed-dose combinations. Generic medicines 
      are approved by regulatory authorities based on the demonstration of bioequivalence 
      with the innovator or reference product, as well as meeting quality standards. In 
      clinical practice, however, it is not unusual for generics to be interchanged 
      between each other. This study investigated the differences in bioavailability 
      between WHO-prequalified first-line antiretroviral generics by means of adjusted 
      indirect comparisons to ensure interchangeability between these generics. METHODS: 
      Data on 34 products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 
      lamivudine and efavirenz in single formulations or fixed-dose combinations were 
      included in the analysis. The 90% CI for the adjusted indirect comparisons was 
      calculated using the homoscedastic method that uses the conventional t-test, and 
      assumes homogeneity of variances between the studies and small sample sizes. The 
      combined standard deviation of both bioequivalence studies was calculated from the 
      variability of each individual study. RESULTS: The adjusted indirect comparisons 
      between generics showed that the differences, expressed as 90% CIs, are less than 
      30%. Confidence in the interchangeability of two generic products was reduced if the 
      mean difference between the test and reference in the original studies is more than 
      10%. CONCLUSIONS: From a bioequivalence perspective, the generic antiretroviral 
      medicines prequalified by WHO are interchangeable with the reference, as well as 
      between each other without safety or efficacy concerns.

TI  - Evaluating Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparisons in Practice: A Case Study of 
      Patients with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.
PG  - 1459-1466
LID - 10.1002/hec.3408 [doi]
AB  - Differences in patient characteristics across trials may bias efficacy estimates 
      from indirect treatment comparisons. To address this issue, matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison (MAIC) measures treatment efficacy after weighting individual 
      patient data to match patient characteristics across trials. To date, however, there 
      is no consensus on how best to implement MAIC. To address this issue, we applied 
      MAIC to measure how two attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatments 
      (guanfacine extended release and atomoxetine hydrochloride) affect patients' ADHD 
      symptoms, as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale IV score. We tested MAIC sensitivity 
      to: matched patient characteristics, matched statistical moments, weighting matrix, 
      and placebo-arm matching (i.e., matching on outcomes in the placebo arm). After 
      applying MAIC, guanfacine and atomoxetine had similar reductions in ADHD symptoms 
      (Δ: 0.4, p < 0.737). The results were similar for three of four sensitivity 
      analyses. When we applied MAIC with placebo-arm matching, however, guanfacine 
      reduced symptoms more than atomoxetine (Δ: -3.9, p < 0.004). We discuss the 
      implication of this finding and advise MAIC practitioners to carefully consider the 
      use of placebo-arm matching, depending on the presence of residual confounding 
      across trials. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of Eltrombopag versus Romiplostim for the Treatment of Chronic 
      Immune Thrombocytopenia in England and Wales.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of eltrombopag compared with 
      romiplostim to be used in the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia in 
      patients in England and Wales who are splenectomized or ineligible for splenectomy 
      and are refractory to other treatments. METHODS: A Markov cohort model in which 
      patients were administered a sequence of treatments was used to predict long-term 
      outcomes associated with each treatment. The model was informed by data from the 
      eltrombopag clinical trial program and the available literature. The analysis was 
      conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, and a lifetime 
      time horizon was used. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: Eltrombopag dominated romiplostim (i.e., eltrombopag was as 
      effective as but less costly than romiplostim) in both splenectomized and 
      nonsplenectomized patients, assuming a class effect for the two treatments. 
      Eltrombopag also dominated romiplostim in most deterministic sensitivity analyses 
      with the exception of when indirect efficacy estimates were incorporated into the 
      model. In this analysis, eltrombopag no longer dominated romiplostim but remained 
      cost-effective versus romiplostim at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per 
      quality-adjusted life-year. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 
      there was a 99% and 92% chance of eltrombopag being cost-effective at a 
      cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in 
      splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results of 
      this study demonstrate that eltrombopag is cost-effective when compared with 
      romiplostim to be used in the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, 
      representing good value for the UK National Health Service.

TI  - Meta-analysis: adjusted indirect comparison of drug-eluting bead transarterial 
      chemoembolization versus (90)Y-radioembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 2031-2041
LID - 10.1007/s00330-016-4548-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate comparative effectiveness of drug-eluting bead 
      transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) versus Yttrium-90 
      ((90)Y)-radioembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Studies 
      comparing conventional (c)TACE versus (90)Y-radioembolization or DEB-TACE for HCC 
      treatment were identified using PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The 
      adjusted indirect meta-analytic method for effectiveness comparison of DEB-TACE 
      versus (90)Y-radioembolization was used. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare 
      baseline characteristics. A priori defined sensitivity analysis of stratified study 
      subgroups was performed for primary outcome analyses. Publication bias was tested by 
      Egger's and Begg's tests. RESULTS: Fourteen studies comparing DEB-TACE or 
      (90)Y-radioembolization with cTACE were included. Analysis revealed a 1-year overall 
      survival benefit for DEB-TACE over (90)Y-radioembolization (79 % vs. 54.8 %; OR: 
      0.57; 95 %CI: 0.355-0.915; p = 0.02; I-squared: 0 %; p > 0.5), but not for the 
      2-year (61 % vs. 34 %; OR: 0.65; 95%CI: 0.294-1.437; p = 0.29) and 3-year survival 
      (56.4 % vs. 20.9 %; OR: 0.713; 95 % CI: 0.21-2.548; p = 0.62). There was significant 
      heterogeneity in the 2- and 3-year survival analyses. The pooled median overall 
      survival was longer for DEB-TACE (22.6 vs. 14.7 months). There was no significant 
      difference in tumour response rate. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE and (90)Y-radioembolization 
      are efficacious treatments for patients suffering from HCC; DEB-TACE demonstrated 
      survival benefit at 1-year compared to (90)Y-radioembolization but direct comparison 
      is warranted for further evaluation. KEY POINTS: • This meta-analysis shows greater 
      1-year survival benefit for DEB-TACE over (90) Y-radioembolization. • DEB-TACE has a 
      favourable 2- & 3-year survival benefit trend over (90) Y-radioembolization. • No 
      significant difference for tumour response was detected. • Direct comparison of 
      these methods for a more robust evaluation is warranted.

TI  - Panobinostat Plus Bortezomib Versus Lenalidomide in Patients with Relapsed and/or 
      Refractory Multiple Myeloma: A Matching-Adjusted Indirect Treatment Comparison of 
      Survival Outcomes using Patient-level Data.
PG  - 45-55
LID - 10.1007/s40258-016-0271-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the UK, the standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma who 
      received ≥2 prior treatments is lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (LEN + DEX) and 
      pomalidomide plus DEX (POM + DEX) (in Wales only). Recently, panobinostat plus 
      bortezomib and DEX (PAN + BTZ + DEX) was licensed in this setting. The current study 
      assessed the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes with 
      PAN + BTZ + DEX versus LEN + DEX (primary comparator) and POM + DEX (exploratory 
      comparator). METHODS: Since an anchor-based indirect treatment comparison was not 
      feasible, the matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison approach was used. To 
      compare the survival outcomes, patient-level data were generated for the comparators 
      utilizing published Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. The use of approximated 
      patient-level data and matched data for PAN + BTZ + DEX allowed the use of Cox 
      proportional hazards models and the assessment of the proportional hazards 
      assumption. In cases where there was evidence that the proportional hazards 
      assumption was violated, time-dependent hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated. Median 
      and mean values for PFS and OS were predicted. RESULTS: For both PFS and OS, the 
      proportional hazards assumption was not satisfied, therefore time-dependent HRs were 
      estimated. Using time-dependent HRs, the mean PFS was estimated to be 11.83 months 
      for PAN + BTZ + DEX and 10.96 months for LEN + DEX. The corresponding mean OS 
      estimates were 30.73 and 27.76 months, respectively. Comparisons with POM + DEX were 
      affected by large uncertainty and did not allow making robust inferences. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study that combined 
      matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison with time-dependent HRs to address 
      changing patterns in the HR. The results suggest that treatment with PAN + BTZ + DEX 
      and LEN + DEX are associated with similar mean PFS and OS in the third-line 
      treatment setting of multiple myeloma.

TI  - GetReal in mathematical modelling: a review of studies predicting drug effectiveness 
      in the real world.
PG  - 264-77
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1202 [doi]
AB  - The performance of a drug in a clinical trial setting often does not reflect its 
      effect in daily clinical practice. In this third of three reviews, we examine the 
      applications that have been used in the literature to predict real-world 
      effectiveness from randomized controlled trial efficacy data. We searched MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE from inception to March 2014, the Cochrane Methodology Register, and websites 
      of key journals and organisations and reference lists. We extracted data on the type 
      of model and predictions, data sources, validation and sensitivity analyses, disease 
      area and software. We identified 12 articles in which four approaches were used: 
      multi-state models, discrete event simulation models, physiology-based models and 
      survival and generalized linear models. Studies predicted outcomes over longer time 
      periods in different patient populations, including patients with lower levels of 
      adherence or persistence to treatment or examined doses not tested in trials. Eight 
      studies included individual patient data. Seven examined cardiovascular and 
      metabolic diseases and three neurological conditions. Most studies included 
      sensitivity analyses, but external validation was performed in only three studies. 
      We conclude that mathematical modelling to predict real-world effectiveness of drug 
      interventions is not widely used at present and not well validated. © 2016 The

TI  - An overview of methods for network meta-analysis using individual participant data: 
      when do benefits arise?
PG  - 1351-1364

AB  - Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a common approach to summarizing relative treatment 
      effects from randomized trials with different treatment comparisons. Most NMAs are 
      based on published aggregate data (AD) and have limited possibilities for 
      investigating the extent of network consistency and between-study heterogeneity. 
      Given that individual participant data (IPD) are considered the gold standard in 
      evidence synthesis, we explored statistical methods for IPD-NMA and investigated 
      their potential advantages and limitations, compared with AD-NMA. We discuss several 
      one-stage random-effects NMA models that account for within-trial imbalances, 
      treatment effect modifiers, missing response data and longitudinal responses. We 
      illustrate all models in a case study of 18 antidepressant trials with a continuous 
      endpoint (the Hamilton Depression Score). All trials suffered from drop-out; 
      missingness of longitudinal responses ranged from 21 to 41% after 6 weeks follow-up. 
      Our results indicate that NMA based on IPD may lead to increased precision of 
      estimated treatment effects. Furthermore, it can help to improve network consistency 
      and explain between-study heterogeneity by adjusting for participant-level effect 
      modifiers and adopting more advanced models for dealing with missing response data. 
      We conclude that implementation of IPD-NMA should be considered when trials are 
      affected by substantial drop-out rate, and when treatment effects are potentially 
      influenced by participant-level covariates.

BTI - Wounds research for patient benefit: a 5-year programme of research
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complex wounds are those that heal by secondary intention and include 
      lower-limb ulcers, pressure ulcers and some surgical wounds. The care of people with 
      complex wounds is costly, with care mainly being delivered by community nurses. 
      There is a lack of current, high-quality data regarding the numbers and types of 
      people affected, care received and outcomes achieved. OBJECTIVES: To (1) assess how 
      high-quality data about complex wounds can be captured effectively for use in both 
      service planning and research while ensuring integration with current clinical data 
      collection systems and minimal impact on staff time; (2) investigate whether or not 
      a clinical register of people with complex wounds could give valid estimates of 
      treatment effects, thus reducing dependence on large-scale randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs); (3) identify the most important research questions and outcomes for 
      people with complex wounds from the perspectives of patients, carers and health-care 
      professionals; (4) evaluate the potential contributions to decision-making of 
      individual patient data meta-analysis and mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis; 
      and (5) complete and update systematic reviews in topic areas of high priority. 
      METHODS: To meet objectives 1 and 2 we conducted a prevalence survey and developed 
      and piloted a longitudinal disease register. A consultative, deliberative method and 
      in-depth interviews were undertaken to address objective 3. To address objectives 4 
      and 5 we conducted systematic reviews including mixed treatment comparison 
      meta-analysis. RESULTS: From the prevalence survey we estimated the point prevalence 
      of all complex wounds to be 1.47 per 1000 people (95% confidence interval 1.38 to 
      1.56 per 1000 people). Pressure ulcers and venous leg ulcers were the most common 
      type of complex wound. A total of 195 people with a complex wound were recruited to 
      a complex wounds register pilot. We established the feasibility of correctly 
      identifying, extracting and transferring routine NHS data into the register; 
      however, participant recruitment, data collection and tracking individual wounds in 
      people with multiple wounds were challenging. Most patients and health professionals 
      regarded healing of the wound as the primary treatment goal. Patients were greatly 
      troubled by the social consequences of having a complex wound. Complex wounds are 
      frequently a consequence of, and are themselves, a long-term condition but treatment 
      is usually focused on healing the wound. Consultative, deliberative research agenda 
      setting on pressure ulcer prevention and treatment with patients, carers and 
      clinicians yielded 960 treatment uncertainties and a top 12 list of research 
      priorities. Of 167 RCTs of complex wound treatments in a systematic review of study 
      quality, 41% did not specify a primary outcome and the overall quality of the 
      conduct and reporting of the research was poor. Mixed-treatment comparison 
      meta-analysis in areas of high priority identified that matrix hydrocolloid 
      dressings had the highest probability (70%) of being the most effective dressing for 
      diabetic foot ulcers, whereas a hyaluronan fleece dressing had the highest 
      probability (35%) of being the most effective dressing for venous ulcers; however, 
      the quality of this evidence was low and uncertainty is high. CONCLUSIONS: Complex 
      wounds are common and costly with a poor evidence base for many frequent clinical 
      decisions. There is little routine clinical data collection in community nursing. A 
      prospective complex wounds register has the potential to both assist clinical 
      decision-making and provide important research evidence but would be challenging to 
      implement without investment in information technology in NHS community services. 
      Future work should focus on developing insights into typical wound healing 
      trajectories, identifying factors that are prognostic for healing and assessing the 
      cost-effectiveness of selected wound treatments. FUNDING: The National Institute for 
      Health Research Programme Grants for Applied Research programme.

      factor VIII for the prophylactic treatment of severe hemophilia A.
PG  - 129-37
LID - 10.2147/JBM.S104074 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: No head-to-head trials comparing recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) 
      products currently exist. This was a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) 
      study of efficacy of BAY 81-8973 with antihemophilic factor (recombinant) 
      plasma/albumin-free method (rAHF-PFM) and turoctocog alfa for the prophylaxis of 
      severe hemophilia A. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to 
      identify trials of rAHF-PFM and turoctocog alfa. Comparisons were conducted using 
      BAY 81-8973 individual patient data (IPD) from LEOPOLD trials and published data 
      from rAHF-PFM and turoctocog alfa trials. Differences in outcome reporting were 
      reconciled using transformation of BAY 81-8973 IPD. Patients in pooled LEOPOLD 
      trials were weighted to match baseline characteristics for rAHF-PFM or turoctocog 
      alfa trials using MAICs. After matching, annualized bleed rates (ABRs) were compared 
      using weighted t-tests. RESULTS: Two rAHF-PFM trials and one turoctocog alfa trial 
      were identified. In these trials, rFVIIIs were dosed thrice weekly or every other 
      day; in LEOPOLD trials, BAY 81-8973 was dosed twice- or thrice weekly. Three MAICs 
      were conducted because the two rAHF-PFM trials calculated ABRs differently, matching 
      for age, race, and weight (turoctocog alfa only). BAY 81-8973 had similar ABR of all 
      bleeds vs rAHF-PFM (two trials: 4.8 vs 6.3, 1.9 vs 1.8 [square root transform]) and 
      lower ABR of spontaneous bleeds and trauma bleeds (2.6 vs 4.1, 2.1 vs 4.7; both 
      P<0.05). BAY 81-8973 showed lower ABR of all bleeds and spontaneous bleeds vs 
      turoctocog alfa (4.3 vs 6.5, 2.8 vs 4.3; both P<0.05) and similar ABR of trauma 
      bleeds (1.5 vs 1.6). In subgroup analysis, twice-weekly BAY 81-8973 had similar ABRs 
      of all bleeds, spontaneous bleeds, and trauma bleeds compared to rAHF-PFM and 
      turoctocog alfa. CONCLUSION: This indirect comparison found that prophylaxis with 
      BAY 81-8973, even including the lower frequency of two times a week and lower factor 
      VIII consumption, has efficacy comparable to rAHF-PFM and turoctocog alfa, which 
      were dosed thrice weekly or every other day. The use of IPD enabled adjustments for 
      differences in calculation of ABRs and population characteristics between trials.

AB  - This review describes essential concepts of network meta-analysis and indirect 
      comparisons and their application to clinical science. There are an increasing 
      number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses providing direct comparisons between 
      different interventions, although this is often not feasible when there is a lack of 
      evidence related to all possible comparisons. Thus, important statistical tools that 
      help make indirect comparisons based on previously existing comparisons have been 
      developed. Network meta-analyses are an innovative tool that could assist doctors, 
      researchers, and governmental organizations when making clinical and public health 
      decisions.

TI  - Baseline visual acuity strongly predicts visual acuity gain in patients with 
      diabetic macular edema following anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment 
      across trials.
PG  - 1103-10
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S100764 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the correlation of baseline visual 
      acuity (VA) with VA outcome in response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF) in diabetic macular edema using a retrospective analysis of nine clinical 
      trials. The result will help assess the relevance of VA gain comparisons across 
      trials. METHODS: A correlation analysis was performed between mean baseline VA and 
      VA gain at month 12 for 1,616 diabetic macular edema patients across nine randomized 
      clinical trials (RESOLVE, RISE, RIDE, RESTORE, RETAIN, DRCR.net Protocol I, DA 
      VINCI, VIVID, VISTA) with anti-VEGF treatment regimens ranibizumab 0.5 mg and 
      aflibercept 2 mg. RESULTS: The mean baseline VA ranged from 56.9 to 64.8 Early 
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. The mean VA gain at month 12 
      ranged from 6.8 to 13.1 ETDRS letters across trials. There was a strong inverse 
      correlation between mean baseline VA and VA gain at month 12 (r=-0.85). The mean VA 
      at 12 months plateaued at ~70 (68.5-73.0) ETDRS letters (20/40 Snellen VA 
      equivalent) for the anti-VEGF treatment groups from all trials, regardless of dosing 
      regimens and agents. CONCLUSION: Cross-trial comparisons based on changes in 
      best-corrected visual acuity should be done cautiously and only after adjusting for 
      best-corrected visual acuity at baseline. Furthermore, the total VA afforded by 
      treatment appears to be subject to a plateau effect, which warrants further 
      exploration.

      METHODS: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of GClb versus 
      other chemoimmunotherapy options. The model comprised three mutually exclusive 
      health states: "progression-free survival (with/without therapy)", "progression 
      (refractory/relapsed lines)", and "death". Each state was assigned a health utility 
      value representing patients' quality of life and a specific cost value. Comparisons 
      between GClb and rituximab plus chlorambucil or only chlorambucil were performed 
      using patient-level clinical trial data; other comparisons were performed via a 
      network meta-analysis using information gathered in a systematic literature review. 
      To support the model, a utility elicitation study was conducted from the perspective 
      of the UK National Health Service. RESULTS: There was good agreement between the 
      model-predicted progression-free and overall survival and that from the CLL11 trial. 
      On incorporating data from the indirect treatment comparisons, it was found that 
      GClb was cost-effective with a range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below 
      a threshold of £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and remained so during 
      deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses under various scenarios. 
      CONCLUSIONS: GClb was estimated to increase both quality-adjusted life expectancy 
      and treatment costs compared with several commonly used therapies, with incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios below commonly referenced UK thresholds. This article 
      offers a real example of how to combine direct and indirect evidence in a 
      cost-effectiveness analysis of oncology drugs.

TI  - The Clinical and Cost Effectiveness of Vortioxetine for the Treatment of a Major 
      Depressive Episode in Patients With Failed Prior Antidepressant Therapy: A Critique 
      of the Evidence.
PG  - 901-12
LID - 10.1007/s40273-016-0417-9 [doi]
AB  - The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
      manufacturer of vortioxetine (Lundbeck) to submit clinical and cost-effectiveness 
      evidence for vortioxetine for the treatment of major depressive episodes (MDEs), as 
      part of the Institute's Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. The Centre for 
      Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York 
      were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This 
      article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the 
      resulting NICE guidance TA367 issued in November 2015. The ERG critically reviewed 
      the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas 
      requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. 
      Two phase III randomised controlled trials for a second-line population involving 
      vortioxetine were identified-REVIVE and TAK318. These two trials represent only 972 
      of over 7000 patients included in trials of vortioxetine. In REVIVE, there was a 
      statistically significant difference in depression scores favouring vortioxetine 
      compared with agomelatine [mean Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 
      score difference of 2.16 points; 95 % confidence interval 0.81-3.51]. The ERG 
      concluded that, based on all the evidence, rather than the substantially restricted 
      subset of evidence originally considered by the manufacturer, vortioxetine is likely 
      to be similar in efficacy to other analysed antidepressants [citalopram, sertraline, 
      escitalopram and venlafaxine extended release (XR)], and may be more efficacious 
      than agomelatine and inferior to duloxetine. The ERG concluded that vortioxetine may 
      be more tolerable than other analysed antidepressants (sertraline, venlafaxine XR 
      and bupropion), although the limited data prevent firm conclusions. The base-case 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vortioxetine reported by the 
      manufacturer was £378 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with 
      venlafaxine. Given considerable concerns about the indirect treatment comparison 
      undertaken by the manufacturer, the use of only a restrictive subset of the 
      available evidence, and concerns regarding comparators and structural model 
      assumptions, the ERG believes that this is not a valid estimate of the cost 
      effectiveness of vortioxetine. Following corrections made to the model made by the 
      ERG, the estimated cost effectiveness of vortioxetine was sensitive to the source of 
      evidence used, in addition to whether certain comparators were excluded. The NICE 
      thus asked the manufacturer to provide a revised economic model, which incorporated 
      the broader evidence base and considered the cost effectiveness of vortioxetine as a 
      third-line treatment. Assuming equal efficacy, vortioxetine was shown to be less 
      costly and generate a higher QALY gain than relevant comparators at the third-line 
      of treatment owing to its tolerability and adverse event profile. The NICE Appraisal 
      Committee recommended vortioxetine as an option for treating MDEs in adults whose 
      condition has responded inadequately to two antidepressants within the current 
      episode.

TI  - Comparative Efficacy of Ceritinib and Crizotinib as Initial ALK-Targeted Therapies 
      in Previously Treated Advanced NSCLC: An Adjusted Comparison with External Controls.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crizotinib and ceritinib have been developed to treat advanced or 
      metastatic NSCLC by inhibiting anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene 
      (ALK). No randomized trial has compared these treatments head-to-head. We compared 
      efficacy outcomes between patients receiving ceritinib and an external control group 
      receiving crizotinib, both as initial ALK-targeted therapies for previously treated 
      advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC. METHODS: Individual patient data for the 
      ceritinib-treated patients were drawn from two single-arm trials (ASCEND-1 and 
      ASCEND-3); published summary data for the crizotinib-treated patients were extracted 
      from three trials (PROFILE 1001, PROFILE 1005, and PROFILE 1007). To adjust for 
      cross-trial differences, average baseline characteristics were matched using 
      propensity score weighting. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), 
      and overall response rate were then compared between treatment groups. RESULTS: 
      Before matching, the ceritinib-treated patients (n = 189) were significantly 
      different from the crizotinib-treated patients (n = 557) in the distribution of race 
      and number of prior regimens. After matching, all available baseline characteristics 
      were balanced. Compared with crizotinib, ceritinib was associated with longer OS 
      (hazard ratio = 0.59, 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.75) and longer PFS 
      (median 13.8 versus 8.3 months, hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% confidence interval: 
      0.44-0.62) in Cox proportional hazards models. The 12-month OS was 82.6% with 
      ceritinib and 66.0% with crizotinib in a Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank p < 0.001). 
      There was no significant difference in overall response rate between ceritinib and 
      crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: In an adjusted comparison across separate clinical trials, 
      ceritinib was associated with prolonged OS and PFS compared with crizotinib when 
      used as initial ALK-targeted therapy for previously treated ALK-positive NSCLC.

TI  - Daclatasvir for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C: A Critique of the Clinical and 
      Economic Evidence.
PG  - 981-92
LID - 10.1007/s40273-016-0418-8 [doi]
AB  - The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
      manufacturer of daclatasvir (Bristol-Myers Squibb) to submit clinical and 
      cost-effectiveness evidence for daclatasvir in combination with other medicinal 
      products within its licensed indication for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, as 
      part of the Institute's single technology appraisal process. The Centre for Reviews 
      and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were 
      commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article 
      presents the ERG's critical review of the evidence presented in the company 
      submission in the context of a description of the company submission, and the 
      resulting NICE guidance. The main clinical effectiveness data for daclatasvir in 
      combination with sofosbuvir (daclatasvir + sofosbuvir) were derived from two 
      uncontrolled open-label trials. Among patients with genotype 1 infection, 98-100 % 
      of patients had a sustained virologic response at week 12 (SVR12), overall. Among 
      genotype 3 patients, between 85 and 100 % had SVR12 across patient populations and 
      regimens. The main evidence for daclatasvir + pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin 
      (PR) came from one randomised controlled trial comparing daclatasvir + PR with PR in 
      patients with genotype 4. This found an SVR12 rate of 82 % in previously untreated 
      patients. Serious adverse event rates associated with daclatasvir were low. The lack 
      of comparative trial evidence for daclatasvir + sofosbuvir and many of the 
      comparators defined in the NICE scope meant that established methods for comparing 
      interventions either directly via head-to-head trial comparisons or via adjusted 
      indirect comparisons were not feasible. Comparisons of SVR rates were therefore 
      largely based on unadjusted estimates drawn from individual trial arms and subgroups 
      of individual trial arms. The ERG concluded that, despite limited evidence, 
      daclatasvir in combination with other treatments appeared to be associated with a 
      high SVR rate. Daclatasvir + sofosbuvir was unlikely to be inferior to comparator 
      treatments in genotype 1 patients; but, due to limited evidence, the relative 
      efficacy of daclatasvir and other treatments in genotype 3 and 4 patients or 
      patients with compensated cirrhosis was uncertain. The economic evaluation compared 
      daclatasvir + sofosbuvir and daclatasvir + PR with a wide range of NICE-approved 
      treatments for hepatitis C. The company submission focused on a series of subgroups 
      defined by disease severity (METAVIR fibrosis stage F3, compensated cirrhosis), 
      genotype and treatment history. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, 
      daclatasvir-containing regimens were cost effective at a £20,000-£30,000 per QALY 
      threshold in the following F3 populations: genotype 1 treatment naïve (Incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = £19,739/QALY) and treatment experienced 
      (£15,687/QALY) and genotypes 1, 3 and 4 interferon ineligible or intolerant 
      (£5906-£9607/QALY depending on subgroup). In patients with cirrhosis, 
      daclatasvir-containing regimens were not cost effective. The ERG found the company's 
      economic analyses to be highly uncertain and in places biased. However, the ERG 
      found that daclatasvir-containing regimens were cost effective in certain 
      populations with significant fibrosis, and following new analyses by the company 
      after a price reduction, in certain populations with cirrhosis, including patients 
      who were not eligible for or who were intolerant to interferon therapy. The NICE 
      Appraisal Committee's preliminary recommendation was that daclatasvir + sofosbuvir 
      should be available as an option in genotype 1 and 4 patients with significant 
      fibrosis but without cirrhosis, who had either been treated previously or were 
      ineligible or intolerant to interferon. In response to the preliminary 
      recommendation, the manufacturer submitted additional information including 
      comparator SVR rates and a revised confidential price. Following this, the Committee 
      expanded its original recommendation in its Final Appraisal Determination. The 
      recommendation was expanded to include daclatasvir + sofosbuvir as an option for 
      patients with significant fibrosis but without cirrhosis (in previously untreated 
      patients with genotype 1, and genotype 3 patients ineligible or intolerant to 
      interferon) and genotype 1, 3 and 4 cirrhotic patients who were ineligible or 
      intolerant to interferon. Daclatasvir + PR was also recommended as an option for 
      genotype 4 patients who had significant fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Safety issues are a major concern for patients considering 
      treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We performed a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis to determine whether biologic agents affect the risk of infection 
      or malignancy in adults with IBD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, 
      Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register, World Health Organization 
      International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov through 
      March 2016 for randomized placebo-controlled or head-to-head trials of biologic 
      agents approved for treatment of adults with IBD (ie, adalimumab, certolizumab, 
      golimumab, infliximab, natalizumab, or vedolizumab). Two reviewers independently 
      extracted study data and outcomes (serious infections, opportunistic infections, 
      tuberculosis, any infection, and malignancies) and rated each trial's risk of bias. 
      We used conventional meta-analysis to synthesize direct evidence and a network 
      meta-analysis for adjusted indirect treatment comparisons. RESULTS: We identified 49 
      randomized placebo-controlled studies comprising 14,590 participants. Synthesis of 
      the evidence indicated that patients treated with biologics had a moderate increase 
      in risk of any infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.10-1.29) and a significant increase in risk of opportunistic infections (OR, 1.90; 
      95% CI, 1.21-3.01). Risk of serious infections was not increased in patients treated 
      with biologics (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71-1.12). On the contrary, biologics appeared to 
      significantly reduce risk of serious infections in studies with low risk of bias 
      (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.90). We did not find an increased risk of malignancy with 
      use of biologic agents (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.54-1.50), but data were insufficient in 
      terms of exposure and follow-up times. None of the indirect comparisons, either 
      among the individual agents or between the anti-tumor necrosis factor and 
      anti-integrin classes, reached significance for any of the outcomes analyzed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a systematic review and meta-analysis, biologic agents 
      increase the risk of opportunistic infections in patients with IBD, but not the risk 
      of serious infections. It is necessary to continue to monitor the comparative and 
      long-term safety profiles of these drugs.

TI  - Comparison between SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors added to insulin therapy in 
      type 2 diabetes: a systematic review with indirect comparison meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1002/dmrr.2818 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors can be used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) that is inadequately controlled with insulin therapy, and yet there 
      has been no direct comparison of these two inhibitors. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, LILACS, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov through June 2015. Randomized controlled trials published in 
      English that compare SGLT2 inhibitor plus insulin (SGLT2i/INS) with placebo plus 
      insulin or DPP4 inhibitor plus insulin (DPP4i/INS) with placebo plus insulin in 
      patients with T2DM were selected. Data on the study characteristics, efficacy and 
      safety outcomes were extracted. We compared the efficacy and safety between 
      SGLT2i/INS and DPP4i/INS indirectly with covariates adjustment. Risk of potential 
      bias was assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen eligible randomized controlled trials 
      comprising 6980 patients were included (five SGLT2 inhibitor studies and nine DPP4 
      inhibitor studies). Covariate-adjusted indirect comparison using meta-regression 
      analyses revealed that SGLT2i/INS achieved greater reduction in HbA(1c) [weighted 
      mean difference (WMD) -0.24%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.43 to -0.05%], fasting 
      plasma glucose (WMD -18.0 mg/dL, 95% CI -28.5 to -7.6 mg/dL) and body weight (WMD 
      -2.38 kg, 95% CI -3.18 to -1.58 kg) from baseline than DPP4i/INS without increasing 
      the risk of hypoglycaemia (relative risks 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.82). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors achieved better glycaemic control and 
      greater weight reduction than DPP4 inhibitors without increasing the risk of 
      hypoglycaemia in patients with T2DM that is inadequately controlled with insulin. 
      There has been no direct comparison of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors in 
      patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with insulin therapy. In this study, we 
      performed indirect meta-analysis comparing SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors 
      added to insulin therapy. Without increasing hypoglycaemia, SGLT2 inhibitors showed 
      better glycaemic control and greater weight reduction than DPP4 inhibitors in 
      patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with insulin. The results of the current 
      study could serve as the best available evidence in selecting oral agents to improve 
      glycaemic control in insulin-treated T2DM patients. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &

TI  - The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of abatacept, adalimumab, 
      etanercept and tocilizumab for treating juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a systematic 
      review and economic evaluation.
PG  - 1-222
LID - 10.3310/hta20340 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is characterised by joint pain, 
      swelling and a limitation of movement caused by inflammation. Subsequent joint 
      damage can lead to disability and growth restriction. Treatment commonly includes 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate. Clinical 
      practice now favours newer drugs termed biologic DMARDs where indicated. OBJECTIVE: 
      To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of four biologic DMARDs 
      [etanercept (Enbrel(®), Pfizer), abatacept (Orencia(®), Bristol-Myers Squibb), 
      adalimumab (Humira(®), AbbVie) and tocilizumab (RoActemra(®), Roche) - with or 
      without methotrexate where indicated] for the treatment of JIA (systemic or 
      oligoarticular JIA are excluded). DATA SOURCES: Electronic bibliographic databases 
      including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and the Database of Abstracts of 
      Reviews of Effects were searched for published studies from inception to May 2015 
      for English-language articles. Bibliographies of related papers, systematic reviews 
      and company submissions were screened and experts were contacted to identify 
      additional evidence. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness, 
      health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness were undertaken in accordance 
      with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
      statement. A cost-utility decision-analytic model was developed to compare the 
      estimated cost-effectiveness of biologic DMARDs versus methotrexate. The base-case 
      time horizon was 30 years and the model took a NHS perspective, with costs and 
      benefits discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: Four placebo-controlled randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria for the clinical effectiveness review (one 
      RCT evaluating each biologic DMARD). Only one RCT included UK participants. 
      Participants had to achieve an American College of Rheumatology Pediatric (ACR 
      Pedi)-30 response to open-label lead-in treatment in order to be randomised. An 
      exploratory adjusted indirect comparison suggests that the four biologic DMARDs are 
      similar, with fewer disease flares and greater proportions of ACR Pedi-50 and -70 
      responses among participants randomised to continued biologic DMARDs. However, 
      confidence intervals were wide, the number of trials was low and there was clinical 
      heterogeneity between trials. Open-label extensions of the trials showed that, 
      generally, ACR responses remained constant or even increased after the double-blind 
      phase. The proportions of adverse events and serious adverse events were generally 
      similar between the treatment and placebo groups. Four economic evaluations of 
      biologic DMARDs for patients with JIA were identified but all had limitations. Two 
      quality-of-life studies were included, one of which informed the cost-utility model. 
      The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for adalimumab, etanercept and 
      tocilizumab versus methotrexate were £38,127, £32,526 and £38,656 per 
      quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. The ICER for abatacept versus 
      methotrexate as a second-line biologic was £39,536 per QALY. LIMITATIONS: The model 
      does not incorporate the natural history of JIA in terms of long-term disease 
      progression, as the current evidence is limited. There are no head-to-head trials of 
      biologic DMARDs, and clinical evidence for specific JIA subtypes is limited. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Biologic DMARDs are superior to placebo (with methotrexate where 
      permitted) in children with (predominantly) polyarticular course JIA who have had an 
      insufficient response to previous treatment. Randomised comparisons of biologic 
      DMARDs with long-term efficacy and safety follow-up are needed to establish 
      comparative effectiveness. RCTs for JIA subtypes for which evidence is lacking are 
      also required. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO

      patient data.
PG  - 47

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several indirect comparison methods, including network meta-analyses 
      (NMAs), using individual patient data (IPD) have been developed to synthesize 
      evidence from a network of trials. Although IPD indirect comparisons are published 
      with increasing frequency in health care literature, there is no guidance on 
      selecting the appropriate methodology and on reporting the methods and results. 
      METHODS: In this paper we examine the methods and reporting of indirect comparison 
      methods using IPD. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL 
      from inception until October 2014. We included published and unpublished studies 
      reporting a method, application, or review of indirect comparisons using IPD and at 
      least three interventions. RESULTS: We identified 37 papers, including a total of 33 
      empirical networks. Of these, only 9 (27 %) IPD-NMAs reported the existence of a 
      study protocol, whereas 3 (9 %) studies mentioned that protocols existed without 
      providing a reference. The 33 empirical networks included 24 (73 %) IPD-NMAs and 9 
      (27 %) matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs). Of the 21 (64 %) networks 
      with at least one closed loop, 19 (90 %) were IPD-NMAs, 13 (68 %) of which evaluated 
      the prerequisite consistency assumption, and only 5 (38 %) of the 13 IPD-NMAs used 
      statistical approaches. The median number of trials included per network was 10 (IQR 
      4-19) (IPD-NMA: 15 [IQR 8-20]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 3-5]), and the median number of IPD 
      trials included in a network was 3 (IQR 1-9) (IPD-NMA: 6 [IQR 2-11]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 
      1-2]). Half of the networks (17; 52 %) applied Bayesian hierarchical models (14 
      one-stage, 1 two-stage, 1 used IPD as an informative prior, 1 unclear-stage), 
      including either IPD alone or with aggregated data (AD). Models for dichotomous and 
      continuous outcomes were available (IPD alone or combined with AD), as were models 
      for time-to-event data (IPD combined with AD). CONCLUSIONS: One in three indirect 
      comparison methods modeling IPD adjusted results from different trials to estimate 
      effects as if they had come from the same, randomized, population. Key 
      methodological and reporting elements (e.g., evaluation of consistency, existence of 
      study protocol) were often missing from an indirect comparison paper.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the benefits and harms of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and 
      anti-integrin agents as induction and maintenance therapy in adult patients with 
      Crohn's disease. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials from inception through July 2015 for randomized clinical trials in 
      patients with Crohn's disease who reported response or remission with anti-TNF-α or 
      anti-integrin agents administered as induction and/or maintenance therapy. Data on 
      the study population, interventions, outcome measures, adverse events, and study 
      methods were extracted independently by 2 authors. FINDINGS: Among 2503 citations 
      identified, 23 met the eligibility criteria. Random-effects model meta-analyses and 
      network meta-analyses were performed. No statistically significant difference was 
      observed between anti-TNF-α and anti-integrin agents with respect to induction and 
      maintenance of response (odds ratio [OR] = 1.20 [95% CI, 0.73-1.96] from 14 trials 
      and OR = 1.23 [95% CI, 0.50-3.03] from 8 trials, respectively) or remission (OR = 
      1.13 [95% CI, 0.72-1.76] from 17 trials and OR = 1.18 [95% CI, 0.55-2.50] from 9 
      trials, respectively). No difference was observed in the indirect comparison of 
      trials that reported results on the subgroup of anti-TNF-α naive patients. The 
      proportions of patients with adverse events, infections, and treatment 
      discontinuations were similar between the agents. IMPLICATIONS: Our indirect 
      treatment comparisons did not find a statistically significant difference between 
      anti-TNF-α and anti-integrin agents for induction or maintenance therapy. In the 
      absence of head-to-head comparisons, it remains unclear which patient is more likely 
      to respond better to any of these agents.

TI  - Comparative Efficacy of Interventional Therapies for Early-stage Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma: A PRISMA-compliant Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.
PG  - e3185

AB  - There are several interventional therapies that improve the prognosis and increase 
      the survival rate of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (early-stage HCC), but it 
      is uncertain about whether one is superior to others, and available researches 
      investigating the comparative effects of different treatments are limited. The main 
      objective of this Bayesian network meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of 
      these different treatment strategies for early-stage HCC and rank these 
      interventions for practical consideration. We performed an electronic search of 
      PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, and extracted data from randomized controlled 
      trials that compared different interventional therapies for early-stage HCC. Direct 
      comparison and network meta-analyses were conducted with Aggregate Data Drug 
      Information System software. Consistency models were created to determine whether 
      there was a significant difference between any 2 therapies, and cumulative 
      probability was used to rank different treatments. Twenty-one randomized controlled 
      trials involving 2691 patients were included. In our network meta-analysis, the 
      combination therapy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and 
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was associated with better 1-year survival rate, as 
      compared with hepatic resection alone (P < 0.05, odds ratio [OR] 0.25, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 0.06-0.83), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) alone 
      (P < 0.05, OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.45), and RFA alone (P < 0.05, OR 0.23, 95% CI 
      0.07-0.70). TACE + RFA had a higher 3-year survival rate than PEI alone (P < 0.05, 
      OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15-0.72) and RFA alone (P < 0.05, OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24-0.87). And 
      there was a statistical difference between RFA + PEI and PEI alone (P < 0.05, OR 
      0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.93) for 3-year survival rate. The results of rank test and 
      cumulative probability showed that TACE + RFA ranked highest on the evaluation of 
      1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rate. Based on Bayesian network meta-analysis 
      combining direct and indirect comparisons, the combination therapy of TACE and RFA 
      seemed to be the most effective strategy for early-stage HCC.

TI  - The relative clinical efficacy of trametinib-dabrafenib and cobimetinib-vemurafenib 
      in advanced melanoma: an indirect comparison.
PG  - 285-9
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12390 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Melanoma causes the majority of skin cancer-related 
      deaths. The outcome of melanoma depends on its stage at diagnosis. Currently, for 
      patients with advanced melanoma, two MEK inhibitors (trametinib and cobimetinib) 
      have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency. The main objective of this 
      study was to compare the relative efficacy of trametinib-dabrafenib and 
      cobimetinib-vemurafenib in patients with advanced melanoma through adjusted indirect 
      treatment comparisons (ITCs). METHODS: A search was made up to the 3rd of November 
      2015. Databases consulted were MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and the Centre for 
      Reviews and Dissemination. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the 
      efficacy of trametinib-dabrafenib or cobimetinib-vemurafenib versus a common 
      treatment comparator, in which outcomes of overall survival, progression-free 
      survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) were considered. ITCs were carried 
      out using the method proposed by Bucher et al. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Two RCTs were 
      included (one for each drugs combination). The results of the adjusted ITCs showed 
      that there were no statistically significant differences between the two 
      combinations in terms of PFS and ORR. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The ITCs indicate 
      no difference in efficacy between both treatments. However, there should be an 
      independent, head-to-head trial of both combinations to confirm the results.

TI  - Indirect Treatment Comparison of Talimogene Laherparepvec Compared with Ipilimumab 
      and Vemurafenib for the Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Melanoma.
PG  - 643-57
LID - 10.1007/s12325-016-0313-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Few randomized controlled trials have compared new treatments for 
      metastatic melanoma. We sought to examine the relative treatment effect of 
      talimogene laherparepvec compared with ipilimumab and vemurafenib. METHODS: A 
      systematic literature review of treatments for metastatic melanoma was undertaken 
      but a valid network of evidence could not be established because of a lack of 
      comparative data or studies with sufficient common comparators. A conventional 
      adjusted indirect treatment comparison via network meta-analysis was, therefore, not 
      feasible. Instead, a meta-analysis of absolute efficacy was undertaken, adjusting 
      overall survival (OS) data for differences in prognostic factors between studies 
      using a published algorithm. RESULTS: Four trials were included in the final 
      indirect treatment comparison: two of ipilimumab, one of vemurafenib, and one of 
      talimogene laherparepvec. Median OS for ipilimumab and vemurafenib increased 
      significantly when adjustment was applied, demonstrating that variation in disease 
      and patient characteristics was biasing OS estimates; adjusting for this made the 
      survival data more comparable. For both ipilimumab and vemurafenib, the adjustments 
      improved Kaplan-Meier OS curves; the observed talimogene laherparepvec OS curve 
      remained above the adjusted OS curves for ipilimumab and vemurafenib, showing that 
      long-term survival could differ from the observed medians. CONCLUSION: Even with 
      limited data, talimogene laherparepvec, ipilimumab, and vemurafenib could be 
      compared following adjustments, thereby providing a more reliable understanding of 
      the relative effect of treatment on survival in a more comparable patient 
      population. The results of this analysis suggest that OS with talimogene 
      laherparepvec is at least as good as with ipilimumab and vemurafenib and improvement 
      was more pronounced in patients with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral 
      metastases. FUNDING: Amgen Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a review of randomized trials to compare the overall 
      survival (OS) with fulvestrant 500 mg versus alternative treatment for estrogen 
      receptor-positive advanced breast cancer following endocrine therapy failure. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hazard ratios (HRs) were obtained by modeling OS data with 
      the Weibull distribution. A fixed-effect Bayesian network meta-analysis was 
      conducted. The evidence network included anastrozole 1 mg, letrozole 2.5 mg, 
      fulvestrant 250 mg, exemestane 25 mg, megestrol acetate 40 mg, and everolimus 10 mg 
      plus exemestane 25 mg as comparators. Post-antiestrogen and post-aromatase inhibitor 
      subgroup networks were analyzed. RESULTS: In the overall analysis, the HRs suggested 
      improved OS for fulvestrant 500 mg versus fulvestrant 250 mg and megestrol acetate 
      40 mg, and numerically favorable differences with fulvestrant 500 mg versus other 
      comparators. In the antiestrogen subgroup, the HRs suggested improved OS for 
      fulvestrant 500 mg versus fulvestrant 250 mg and megestrol acetate 40 mg; numerical 
      differences in the HRs were seen versus anastrozole 1 mg and letrozole 2.5 mg. In 
      the aromatase inhibitor subgroup, the HRs for OS numerically favored fulvestrant 500 
      mg versus fulvestrant 250 mg and exemestane 25 mg. CONCLUSION: Acknowledging the 
      limitations of the present network meta-analysis, these findings suggest that 
      fulvestrant 500 mg might provide improved OS versus fulvestrant 250 mg and megestrol 
      acetate 40 mg for treatment of estrogen receptor-positive ABC following endocrine 
      therapy failure. Although OS efficacy versus everolimus 10 mg plus exemestane 25 mg 
      (for overall evidence network), anastrozole 1 mg, exemestane 25 mg, and letrozole 
      2.5 mg is numerically favorable, additional studies are required to draw formal 
      conclusions.

TI  - Review and comparison of methodologies for indirect comparison of clinical trial 
      results: an illustration with ranibizumab and aflibercept.
PG  - 793-801
AB  - AIM: To review and compare methods for indirect comparison of aflibercept and 
      ranibizumab in patients with diabetic macular edema. METHODS: Post-stratification, 
      inverse probability weighting based on simulated data, weight optimization, and 
      regression model techniques were used to compare pooled individual patient-level 
      data from the RESTORE and RESPOND (ranibizumab 0.5 mg as needed after 3 initial 
      monthly doses) studies with summary-level data from the VIVID and VISTA (aflibercept 
      2.0 mg every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly doses, 2q8) studies. The impact of 
      adjusting for up to two baseline characteristics was assessed. RESULTS: All methods 
      provided similar results. After adjustment for baseline best-corrected visual acuity 
      and central retinal thickness, no statistically significant difference in average 
      gain in baseline best-corrected visual acuity from baseline at month 12 was found 
      between ranibizumab 0.5 mg and aflibercept 2q8. CONCLUSIONS: Weight optimization and 
      regression methods are useful options to adjust for more than one baseline 
      characteristic.

TI  - Meta-analysis and adjusted indirect comparison of direct oral anticoagulants in 
      prevention of acute limb ischemia in patients with atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1167-73
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2016.1163256 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants are being presented as alternatives to 
      warfarin for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Yet direct 
      comparative trials between these agents in prevention of acute limb ischemia (ALI) 
      are unavailable so far. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an adjusted indirect comparison 
      meta-analysis between direct oral agents for prevention of acute limb ischemia in 
      atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review searching 
      electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase) and the Cochrane Library from January 1990 
      through November 2014. Two blinded investigators reviewed all potentially relevant 
      articles in a parallel manner by using a priori defined criteria. To assess the 
      long-term efficacy and safety of these agents, only randomized clinical trials 
      (RCTs) with follow-up durations of >1 year were included. The primary efficacy 
      outcome was the end point of acute limb ischemia and/or extremity embolism. RESULTS: 
      A total of 44,563 patients from three RCTs met criteria for inclusion. Patients 
      randomized to direct oral anticoagulants had a non-significant decreased risk for 
      acute limb ischemia (risk ratio [RR]: 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-1.2). 
      In the analysis between agents, however, rivaroxaban significantly lowered the risk 
      of ALI compared to warfarin (RR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.064-0.82), apixaban (RR: 0.26, 95% 
      CI: 0.081-0.83), and dabigatran (RR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.077-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Significant differences in prevention of acute limb ischemia may exist between oral 
      anticoagulant agents in patients with atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban lowers the 
      risk of limb embolism versus warfarin, apixaban and dabigatran.

TI  - Integrated sensor-augmented pump therapy systems [the MiniMed® Paradigm™ Veo system 
      and the Vibe™ and G4® PLATINUM CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) system] for 
      managing blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and economic 
      evaluation.
PG  - v-xxxi, 1-251
LID - 10.3310/hta20170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, meters for continuous monitoring of interstitial fluid 
      glucose have been introduced to help people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) to 
      achieve better control of their disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project 
      was to summarise the evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness 
      of the MiniMed(®) Paradigm™ Veo system (Medtronic Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) and the 
      Vibe™ (Animas(®) Corporation, West Chester, PA, USA) and G4(®) PLATINUM CGM 
      (continuous glucose monitoring) system (Dexcom Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) in 
      comparison with multiple daily insulin injections (MDIs) or continuous subcutaneous 
      insulin infusion (CSII), both with either self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) or 
      CGM, for the management of T1DM in adults and children. DATA SOURCES: A systematic 
      review was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Centre for Reviews and 
      Dissemination guidance and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
      Diagnostic Assessment Programme manual. We searched 14 databases, three trial 
      registries and two conference proceedings from study inception up to September 2014. 
      In addition, reference lists of relevant systematic reviews were checked. In the 
      absence of randomised controlled trials directly comparing Veo or an integrated 
      CSII + CGM system, such as Vibe, with comparator interventions, indirect treatment 
      comparisons were performed if possible. METHODS: A commercially available 
      cost-effectiveness model, the IMS Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness 
      diabetes model version 8.5 (IMS Health, Danbury, CT, USA), was used for this 
      assessment. This model is an internet-based, interactive simulation model that 
      predicts the long-term health outcomes and costs associated with the management of 
      T1DM and type 2 diabetes. The model consists of 15 submodels designed to simulate 
      diabetes-related complications, non-specific mortality and costs over time. As the 
      model simulates individual patients over time, it updates risk factors and 
      complications to account for disease progression. RESULTS: Fifty-four publications 
      resulting from 19 studies were included in the review. Overall, the evidence 
      suggests that the Veo system reduces hypoglycaemic events more than other 
      treatments, without any differences in other outcomes, including glycated 
      haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. We also found significant results in favour of the 
      integrated CSII + CGM system over MDIs with SMBG with regard to HbA1c levels and 
      quality of life. However, the evidence base was poor. The quality of the included 
      studies was generally low, often with only one study comparing treatments in a 
      specific population at a specific follow-up time. In particular, there was only one 
      study comparing Veo with an integrated CSII + CGM system and only one study 
      comparing Veo with a CSII + SMBG system in a mixed population. Cost-effectiveness 
      analyses indicated that MDI + SMBG is the option most likely to be cost-effective, 
      given the current threshold of £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, 
      whereas integrated CSII + CGM systems and Veo are dominated and extendedly 
      dominated, respectively, by stand-alone, non-integrated CSII with CGM. Scenario 
      analyses did not alter these conclusions. No cost-effectiveness modelling was 
      conducted for children or pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: The Veo system does appear to 
      be better than the other systems considered at reducing hypoglycaemic events. 
      However, in adults, it is unlikely to be cost-effective. Integrated systems are also 
      generally unlikely to be cost-effective given that stand-alone systems are cheaper 
      and, possibly, no less effective. However, evidence in this regard is generally 
      lacking, in particular for children. Future trials in specific child, adolescent and 
      adult populations should include longer term follow-up and ratings on the European 
      Quality of Life-5 Dimensions scale at various time points with a view to informing 
      improved cost-effectiveness modelling. STUDY REGISTRATION: PROSPERO Registration

AB  - CONTEXT: OnabotulinumtoxinA and mirabegron have recently gained marketing 
      authorisation to treat symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 
      the relative efficacy of mirabegron and onabotulinumtoxinA in patients with 
      idiopathic OAB. DESIGN: Network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: A search of 9 
      electronic databases, review documents, guidelines and websites. METHODS: Randomised 
      trials comparing any licensed dose of onabotulinumtoxinA or mirabegron with each 
      other, anticholinergic drugs or placebo were eligible (19 randomised trials were 
      identified). 1 reviewer extracted data from the studies and a second reviewer 
      checked the data. Candidate trials were assessed for similarity and networks were 
      developed for each outcome. Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using both 
      fixed-effects and random-effects models. When there were differences in mean 
      baseline values between mirabegron and onabotulinumtoxinA trials they were adjusted 
      for using network meta-regression (NMR). RESULTS: No studies directly comparing 
      onabotulinumtoxinA to mirabegron were identified. A network was created for each of 
      the 7 outcomes, with 3-9 studies included in each individual network. The trials 
      included in the networks were broadly similar. Patients in the onabotulinumtoxinA 
      trials had more urinary incontinence and urgency episodes at baseline than patients 
      in the mirabegron trials and these differences were adjusted for using NMR. Both 
      onabotulinumtoxinA and mirabegron were more efficacious than placebo at reducing the 
      frequency of urinary incontinence, urgency, urination and nocturia. 
      OnabotulinumtoxinA was more efficacious than mirabegron (50 and 25 mg) in completely 
      resolving daily episodes of urinary incontinence and urgency and in reducing the 
      frequency of urinary incontinence, urgency and urination. NMR supported the results 
      of the network meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head trials 
      comparing onabotulinumtoxinA to mirabegron, this indirect comparison indicates that 
      onabotulinumtoxinA may be superior to mirabegron in improving symptoms of urinary 
      incontinence, urgency and urinary frequency in patients with idiopathic OAB.

TI  - Indirect treatment comparison of belatacept versus tacrolimus from a systematic

AB  - OBJECTIVE: End-stage renal disease is the final and irreversible stage in chronic 
      kidney disease, leading to patient mortality, unless managed by dialysis or 
      transplantation (the treatment of choice). This study aimed to compare a currently 
      recommended immunosuppressive treatment, tacrolimus, against a newer treatment, 
      belatacept, using indirect treatment comparison (ITC) techniques since no 
      head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tacrolimus against 
      belatacept currently exist. METHODS: ITC was employed to calculate estimates for the 
      relative risks and mean difference of tacrolimus against belatacept. The choice of 
      the Bucher ITC model was driven by the available data and the simple indirect 
      treatment comparison involving three treatments was considered appropriate. RESULTS: 
      The results of the indirect analysis showed no significant differences between 
      belatacept and tacrolimus treatments for mortality and graft loss. The acute 
      rejection rate was significantly lower with tacrolimus (Prograf* and Advagraf (*) ) 
      compared with belatacept (0.22 [0.13, 0.39] to 0.44 [0.20, 0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that tacrolimus is 
      significantly superior to belatacept in terms of acute rejection outcomes but 
      comparable for graft and patient survival. Further research should include a 
      properly designed clinical trial comparing tacrolimus against belatacept directly. 
      LIMITATIONS: These include variations in terms of clinical and design differences 
      among the trials, weaknesses in the Bucher method and the lack of long-term clinical 
      trial data with tacrolimus to compare with the recent long-term (7 years) belatacept 
      trial data.

TI  - First-line therapy for treatment-naive patients with advanced/metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma: a systematic review of published randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 383-97
LID - 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000335 [doi]
AB  - In the recent years, a number of targeted therapies have been approved for 
      first-line treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A systematic 
      review was conducted to assess the clinical efficacy, safety and effect of all 
      first-line treatments evaluated to date on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A 
      systematic search of Embase, Cochrane and MEDLINE databases was performed to 
      identify randomized controlled trials (1980-2015) evaluating any targeted 
      therapy/immunotherapy against placebo or any other targeted 
      intervention/immunotherapy in treatment-naive patients with metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma. Conference proceedings from major cancer congresses (2007-2015) were 
      handsearched. Sixteen randomized controlled trials were identified, mostly phase 
      III. Overall, targeted therapies were associated with either improved [sunitinib, 
      bevacizumab+interferon α (IFNα) and temsirolimus] or comparable (sorafenib) 
      progression-free survival (PFS) versus IFNα monotherapy. Sunitinib demonstrated 
      comparable PFS and overall survival to pazopanib, comparable PFS to sorafenib and 
      shorter PFS compared with bevacizumab+IFNα (although no conclusions were made with 
      regard to superiority/inferiority). Compared with sorafenib, tivozanib demonstrated 
      a significantly longer PFS, and both tivozanib and axitinib demonstrated higher 
      response rates. Nintedanib demonstrated comparable PFS and overall survival to 
      sunitinib in a phase II trial. Temsirolimus, sunitinib and sorafenib treatment led 
      to better HRQoL versus IFNα; pazopanib was associated with better HRQoL versus 
      sunitinib. No direct meta-analyses or indirect treatment comparison analysis were 
      undertaken because of noncomparability of the trials. In general, targeted therapies 
      demonstrated favourable clinical efficacy and improved HRQoL compared with IFNα 
      monotherapy. The newer therapies, tivozanib and axitinib (but not nintedanib), 
      appeared to exhibit greater clinical benefit (response rate) than older tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Aclidinium/Formoterol versus Tiotropium in COPD: Results of 
      an Indirect Treatment Comparison.
PG  - 379-99
LID - 10.1007/s12325-016-0299-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to estimate the relative efficacy and 
      safety of fixed-dose combination aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg twice daily 
      compared to tiotropium 18 μg once daily in adult patients with moderate-to-severe 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: A systematic literature 
      review performed in March 2014, using a predefined search strategy in MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE and Cochrane Library, identified 17 randomized placebo-controlled trials, 
      (tiotropium n = 15; aclidinium/formoterol n = 2). Outcomes of interest were: 
      bronchodilation (peak and trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)), COPD 
      symptoms [Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score and % of responders (>1 unit 
      improvement)] and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) [St. George's Respiratory 
      Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and % responders (>4 unit improvement)], % of 
      patients with ≥1 exacerbations, adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), 
      hospitalization and mortality, all at 24 weeks. In the absence of head-to-head 
      trials between aclidinium/formoterol and tiotropium, a Bayesian indirect treatment 
      comparison (ITC) was used with placebo as common control. RESULTS: Regarding 
      bronchodilation, aclidinium/formoterol was found to be more efficacious than 
      tiotropium at peak FEV1, with mean difference in change from baseline (DCFB) 143 mL 
      [95% credible interval (CrI): 112, 174] and at trough FEV1 [DCFB 26 mL (95% CrI -2, 
      55)]. Aclidinium/formoterol is expected to be more efficacious than tiotropium in 
      improving dyspnea symptoms measured by TDI [DCFB 0.54 points (95% CrI 0.09, 0.99); 
      odds ratio (OR) of responders 1.51 (95% CrI 1.11, 2.06)]. SGRQ results are 
      comparable for aclidinium/formoterol versus tiotropium [DCFB -0.52 (95% CrI -2.21, 
      1.17); OR of responders 1.16 (95% CrI 0.47, 2.87)]. The ITC results suggest similar 
      safety profiles regarding AEs, SAEs and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Based on the 
      ITC, aclidinium/formoterol is expected to be more efficacious than tiotropium in 
      terms of lung function and symptom control while providing comparable HRQoL results 
      and safety profile. FUNDING: AstraZeneca.

TI  - Testing moderation in network meta-analysis with individual participant data.
PG  - 2485-502
LID - 10.1002/sim.6883 [doi]
AB  - Meta-analytic methods for combining data from multiple intervention trials are 
      commonly used to estimate the effectiveness of an intervention. They can also be 
      extended to study comparative effectiveness, testing which of several alternative 
      interventions is expected to have the strongest effect. This often requires network 
      meta-analysis (NMA), which combines trials involving direct comparison of two 
      interventions within the same trial and indirect comparisons across trials. In this 
      paper, we extend existing network methods for main effects to examining moderator 
      effects, allowing for tests of whether intervention effects vary for different 
      populations or when employed in different contexts. In addition, we study how the 
      use of individual participant data may increase the sensitivity of NMA for detecting 
      moderator effects, as compared with aggregate data NMA that employs study-level 
      effect sizes in a meta-regression framework. A new NMA diagram is proposed. We also 
      develop a generalized multilevel model for NMA that takes into account within-trial 
      and between-trial heterogeneity and can include participant-level covariates. Within 
      this framework, we present definitions of homogeneity and consistency across trials. 
      A simulation study based on this model is used to assess effects on power to detect 
      both main and moderator effects. Results show that power to detect moderation is 
      substantially greater when applied to individual participant data as compared with 
      study-level effects. We illustrate the use of this method by applying it to data 
      from a classroom-based randomized study that involved two sub-trials, each comparing 
      interventions that were contrasted with separate control groups. Copyright © 2016

AB  - PURPOSE: Our aim was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of daclatasvir plus 
      sofosbuvir (DCV+SOF) versus SOF plus ribavirin (SOF+R) in patients coinfected with 
      HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: A systematic literature review of Phase 
      III clinical trials identified 2 trials of SOF+R-PHOTON-1 (A Phase 3, Open-Label 
      Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of GS-7977 Plus Ribavirin in Chronic 
      Genotype 1, 2 and 3 Hepatitis C Virus [HCV] and Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV] 
      Co-Infected Subjects) and PHOTON-2 (A Phase 3, Open-Label Study to Investigate the 
      Efficacy and Safety of Sofosbuvir Plus Ribavirin in Chronic Genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 
      Hepatitis C Virus [HCV] and Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV] Co-Infected Subjects) 
      suitable for comparison with the trial of DCV+SOF in patients coinfected with HIV 
      and HCV-ALLY-2 (A Phase 3 Evaluation of Daclatasvir Plus Sofosbuvir in 
      Treatment-naïve and Treatment-experienced Chronic Hepatitis C [Genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 
      5, or 6] Subjects Coinfected With Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV]). Individual 
      patient data from ALLY-2 were available; published summary data were extracted and 
      pooled for the PHOTON trials. To adjust for cross-trial differences, ALLY-2 patients 
      were subject to the inclusion and exclusion criteria reported in the PHOTON trials 
      and were weighted to match all available summary baseline characteristics reported 
      in both PHOTON trials. Sustained virologic response at week 12 post-treatment 
      (SVR12) discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) and rates of AEs were compared. 
      FINDINGS: The SVR12 rate was significantly higher among patients treated with 
      DCV+SOF (n = 91) than among those treated with SOF+R (n = 455) both before (96.7% vs 
      84.6%; P = 0.002) and after (99.9% vs 84.6%; P < 0.001) adjusting for baseline 
      characteristics. After adjustment, compared with patients treated with SOF+R, 
      patients receiving DCV+SOF had a significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to 
      AEs and significantly lower rates of the following specific AEs: cough, diarrhea, 
      insomnia, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and hemoglobin <10 
      g/dL. IMPLICATIONS: After adjustment for cross-trial differences in baseline 
      characteristics, DCV+SOF was associated with a significantly higher SVR12 rate and 
      lower rate of discontinuation due to AEs than SOF+R in patients coinfected with HIV 
      and HCV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a form of chronic progressive 
      fibrosing interstitial lung disease of unknown origin. Recently, nintedanib and 
      pirfenidone demonstrated efficacy in slowing disease progression and were approved 
      by the US Food and Drug Administration. Although numerous treatments have been 
      evaluated in IPF, none have shown significant decreases in mortality. The objective 
      of this study was to identify all pharmacologic treatments evaluated for IPF and 
      analyze their efficacy via Bayesian network meta-analysis and pairwise indirect 
      treatment comparisons. This review did not evaluate the effect of steroid therapy. 
      METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published 
      on or before August 2014. Studies were required to contain a randomized evaluation 
      of nonsteroidal drug therapy for treatment of IPF and be published in English. Key 
      outcomes of interest for this analysis were pulmonary function as measured by FVC as 
      well as all-cause and respiratory-specific death. All outcomes were analyzed via a 
      Bayesian framework. RESULTS: Our review identified 30 eligible studies that 
      evaluated 16 unique treatments. Under both the fixed-effect and random-effect models 
      for respiratory-specific mortality, no treatments performed better than placebo. For 
      all-cause mortality, pirfenidone and nintedanib had effects approaching significance 
      with credible intervals slightly crossing the null under a fixed-effect model. 
      Notably, for respiratory-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, and decline in 
      percent predicted FVC, nintedanib and pirfenidone were virtually indistinguishable 
      and no clear advantage was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Although two treatments have been 
      approved for IPF on the basis of reduced decline in pulmonary function, neither one 
      has a clear advantage on mortality outcomes.

AB  - Background The objective of this study is twofold: 1) to propose a simulation model 
      for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (mBC) which could further be used to assess the 
      overall cost-effectiveness of the treatment sequences that would maximize survival 
      of patients, and 2) to estimate transitional probabilities between treatment lines 
      required to parameterize the simulation model, in the absence of individual patient 
      data (IPD). Methods Individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed for treatment 
      lines composing four treatment sequences. Parametric models were tested to select 
      the model that best fits the IPD. The transitional probability equations, used for 
      disease progression modeling, were obtained by substituting the parameters of the 
      general equation for transitional probabilities by the parameters estimated from 
      fitted distributions. Results The log-logistic model best fitted the reconstructed 
      data for progression-free and overall survival curves for each line of treatment. 
      The shapes and scales of the log-logistic models were used to develop the 
      transitional probability equations for the HER2+ mBC simulation model. KEY 
      LIMITATIONS: The estimation of the transitional probabilities depends heavily on the 
      accuracy of the IPD reconstruction. Nonetheless, analytical and graphical tests can 
      be performed to check the face validity of the reconstructed data. Additionally, 
      sensitivity analyses can be conducted to test the impact of uncertainty surrounding 
      the estimated parameters defining equations for transitional probabilities. 
      Conclusion The results of this study can be used as input in model-based economic 
      evaluations of sequential therapy for HER2+ mBC.

AB  - The purpose of our indirect comparison was to explore the optimal switching time to 
      noninvasive ventilation for further weaning in patients with chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD) undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. A comprehensive 
      literature search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials comparing 
      noninvasive weaning at spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure after meeting 
      simple weaning criteria or at the pulmonary infection control window (PIC window) 
      with conventional invasive weaning in COPD patients. Using conventional invasive 
      weaning as a bridge, we indirectly compared the two noninvasive weaning strategies 
      using the Bucher approach. Noninvasive weaning at SBT failure after meeting simple 
      weaning criteria was associated with an extended duration of endotracheal mechanical 
      ventilation (standardized mean difference 1.90, 95% CI 1.27-2.53, P < 0.001) 
      compared with noninvasive weaning at the PIC window. No significant differences in 
      mortality or the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia were observed. Our study 
      suggests that the PIC window may be a promising switching time for noninvasive 
      weaning in COPD patients.

      Japanese patients: an indirect comparison.
PG  - 273-9
LID - 10.2217/cer.15.69 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To compare daclatasvir + asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) versus sofosbuvir/ledipasvir 
      (SOF/LDV) for hepatitis C virus genotype 1b in Japanese patients without NS5A 
      polymorphisms at L31 and Y93H. PATIENTS & METHODS: All Phase III trials of SOF/LDV 
      and DCV + ASV conducted in Japan were included. To adjust for cross-trial 
      differences, DCV + ASV patients were weighted to match reported SOF/LDV summary 
      baseline characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment, the rate of SVR12 (99.3 vs 
      100%; p = 0.398) and discontinuation due to adverse events (1.3 vs 0.0%; p = 0.327) 
      were similar between patients treated with DCV + ASV (n = 252) and SOF/LDV (n = 
      171). CONCLUSION: After adjusting for cross-trial differences in baseline 
      characteristics, DCV + ASV and SOF/LDV were associated with similar efficacy and 
      discontinuation due to adverse events in the treatment of hepatitis C virus genotype 
      1b in Japanese patients without NS5A polymorphisms.

TI  - Lipophilic Statin Versus Rosuvastatin (Hydrophilic) Treatment for Heart Failure: a 
      Meta-Analysis and Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Randomised Trials.
PG  - 177-88
LID - 10.1007/s10557-015-6636-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare lipophilic and hydrophilic statin therapy on 
      clinical outcomes of heart failure (HF) using a systematic review and an adjusted 
      indirect comparison meta-analysis. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular 
      mortality, cardiovascular hospitalization and hospitalization for worsening HF. 
      METHODS: We conducted a search of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases until 31st 
      December 2014 for randomized control trials (RCTs) in HF evaluating statins versus 
      placebo. Identified RCTs and their respective abstracted information were grouped 
      according to statin type evaluated and analyzed separately. Outcomes were initially 
      pooled with the Peto's one-step method, producing odd ratios (OR) and 95 % 
      confidence intervals (CI) for each statin type. Using these pooled estimates, we 
      performed adjusted indirect comparisons of lipophilic versus hydrophilic statin for 
      each outcome. RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 10,966 patients were identified 
      and analyzed. Lipophilic statins were superior to hydrophilic rosuvastatin regarding 
      all-cause mortality (OR 0 · 50; 95 % CI, 0 · 11-0 · 89; p = 0 · 01), cardiovascular 
      mortality (OR 0 · 61; 0 · 25-0 · 97; p = 0 · 009), and hospitalization for worsening 
      HF (OR 0 · 52; 0 · 21-0 · 83; p = 0 · 0005). However, both statins were comparable 
      with regards to cardiovascular hospitalization [OR 0 · 80 (0 · 31, 1 · 28); 
      p = 0 · 36]. CONCLUSIONS: Lipophilic statin treatment shows significant decreases in 
      all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for worsening HF 
      compared with rosuvastatin treatment. This meta-analysis provides preliminary 
      evidence that lipophilic statins offer better clinical outcomes in HF till data from 
      head to head comparisons are available.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and 
      several organisations, such as the National Institute for Health and Care 
      Excellence, suggest that management of patients with AD should be tailored to their 
      needs. To date, little research has been conducted on the treatment effect in 
      different subgroups of patients with AD. The aim of this study is to examine the 
      comparative effectiveness and safety of cognitive enhancers for different patient 
      characteristics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will update our previous literature search 
      from January 2015 forward, using the same terms and electronic databases (eg, 
      MEDLINE) from our previous review. We will additionally search grey literature and 
      scan the reference lists of the included studies. Randomised clinical trials of any 
      duration conducted at any time comparing cognitive enhancers alone or in any 
      combination against other cognitive enhancers, or placebo in adults with AD will be 
      eligible. The outcomes of interest are cognition according to the Mini-Mental State 
      Examination, and overall serious adverse events. For each outcome and treatment 
      comparison, we will perform a Bayesian hierarchical random-effects meta-analysis 
      combining the individual patient data (IPD) from each eligible study. If the 
      identified treatment comparisons form a connected network diagram, we will perform 
      an IPD network meta-analysis (NMA) to estimate subgroup effects for patients with 
      different characteristics, such as AD severity and sex. We will combine aggregated 
      data from studies that we will not be able to obtain IPD, with the IPD provided by 
      the original authors, in a single model. We will use the PRISMA-IPD and PRISMA-NMA 
      statements to report our findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings of this 
      study will be of interest to stakeholders, including decision makers, guideline 
      developers, clinicians, methodologists and patients, and they will help to improve 
      guidelines for the management of patients with AD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

AB  - Pairwise meta-analysis is an established statistical tool for synthesizing evidence 
      from multiple trials, but it is informative only about the relative efficacy of two 
      specific interventions. The usefulness of pairwise meta-analysis is thus limited in 
      real-life medical practice, where many competing interventions may be available for 
      a certain condition and studies informing some of the pairwise comparisons may be 
      lacking. This commonly encountered scenario has led to the development of network 
      meta-analysis (NMA). In the last decade, several applications, methodological 
      developments, and empirical studies in NMA have been published, and the area is 
      thriving as its relevance to public health is increasingly recognized. This article 
      presents a review of the relevant literature on NMA methodology aiming to pinpoint 
      the developments that have appeared in the field. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &

TI  - Meta-analysis supporting noninferiority of oxaliplatin plus S-1 to cisplatin plus 
      S-1 in first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer (G-SOX study): indirect 
      comparison with S-1 alone.
PG  - 668-675
LID - 10.1007/s10147-015-0938-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Randomized Phase III Study Comparing Oxaliplatin plus S-1 with 
      Cisplatin plus S-1 in Chemotherapy-naïve Patients with Advanced Gastric Cancer 
      (G-SOX) showed the noninferiority of S-1 (an oral fluoropyrimidine-derivative 
      dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase inhibitor) plus oxaliplatin combination therapy 
      (SOX) to S-1 plus cisplatin therapy (CS) in overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) from 
      proportional hazard model 0.958, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.803-1.142; 
      noninferiority margin 1.15]. To further clarify the clinical position of SOX in 
      advanced gastric cancer (AGC), a meta-analysis including information from other 
      reported studies was conducted. METHODS: In addition to G-SOX, Japanese phase III 
      clinical trials including S-1 monotherapy were included in the analyses. Individual 
      patient data for SOX (318 patients) and CS (324 patients) from G-SOX, as well as 
      those for S-1 (160 patients) from the Randomized Phase III Study Comparing the 
      Efficacy and Safety of Irinotecan plus S-1 with S-1 Alone as First-line Treatment 
      for Advanced Gastric Cancer (GC0301/TOP-002), were available. Published clinical 
      information for S-1 from other studies (total 705 patients) was also collected. A 
      Weibull distribution was assumed for overall survival time, and parameters for SOX, 
      CS, and S-1 were estimated parametrically. Posterior HR distributions were obtained 
      with a Bayesian approach. RESULTS: The HR of SOX to S-1 was 0.817 (95 % credible 
      interval 0.704-0.939), and the probability of the HR <1.00 was 99.8 %. The HR of CS 
      to S-1 was 0.871 (95 % credible interval; 0.754-0.998), and the probability of the 
      HR <1.00 was 97.6 %. The HR of SOX to CS in G-SOX was 0.942 (95 % credible interval; 
      0.789-1.117), and the probability of HR <1.15 was 98.9 %. CONCLUSION: This 
      meta-analysis indicates that SOX was superior to S-1 and noninferior to CS in AGC.

TI  - Once-daily liraglutide (1.2 mg) compared with twice-daily exenatide (10 μg) in the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes patients: An indirect treatment comparison 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 866-876
LID - 10.1111/1753-0407.12372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists provide effective 
      hyperglycemia management in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a randomized 
      head-to-head trial, liraglutide 1.8 mg q.d. led to greater reductions in HbA1c than 
      exenatide 10 μg b.i.d. There are no direct comparisons of liraglutide 1.2 mg q.d. 
      and exenatide b.i.d.; therefore, in the present study, an indirect comparison and 
      meta-analysis were undertaken. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed 
      for randomized controlled trials of liraglutide 1.2 mg q.d. or exenatide b.i.d. with 
      HbA1c as an outcome and ≥25 subjects. Key data were extracted and analyzed. A 
      random-effects model was used to incorporate heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: 
      Three liraglutide 1.2 mg q.d. (n = 1060) and 10 exenatide b.i.d. (n = 2609) 
      placebo-controlled studies were identified, allowing indirect comparison with 
      placebo as the common arm. Baseline characteristics were mean age ~55 years, disease 
      duration ~7 years, HbA1c ~8%, and body mass index ~32 kg/m(2) . Compared with 
      exenatide b.i.d., liraglutide 1.2 mg was associated with significantly greater 
      reductions from baseline in HbA1c (-0.29%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.53, 
      -0.05) and fasting plasma glucose (-0.92 mmol/L; 95% CI -1.43, -0.41), with shorter 
      duration of nausea (3 vs 14 days; P = 0.002) and fewer withdrawals (odds ratio 0.34; 
      95% CI 0.22, 0.52). The incidence of adverse events (including nausea) and 
      withdrawals because of adverse events were similar between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Liraglutide 1.2 mg provided a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c than 
      exenatide 10 μg b.i.d. The significantly shorter duration of nausea with liraglutide 
      than exenatide may be appreciated by patients.

TI  - Safety and effectiveness of long-acting versus intermediate-acting insulin for 
      patients with type 1 diabetes: protocol for a systematic review and individual 
      patient data network meta-analysis.
PG  - e010160

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The choice of a basal insulin regimen to manage type 1 diabetes 
      mellitus (T1DM) may have different risks of adverse events and effectiveness, due to 
      the difference in the effectiveness of these agents across patient characteristics 
      (eg, baseline glycosylated haemoglobin; A1C). Currently, there is a lack of high 
      quality evidence to support the tailoring of insulin regimens according to an 
      individual's needs. The aim of this study is to update our previous systematic 
      review and perform an individual patient data network meta-analysis (IPD-NMA) to 
      evaluate the comparative safety and effectiveness of long-acting versus 
      intermediate-acting insulin in different subgroups of patients with T1DM. METHODS 
      AND ANALYSIS: We will update our previous literature search from January 2013 
      onwards searching relevant electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE), as well as perform 
      grey literature search through relevant society/association websites, and conference 
      abstracts, and scan reference lists of the eligible studies. We will include 
      randomised clinical trials of any duration examining long-acting versus 
      intermediate-acting insulin preparations for adult patients with T1DM. We will focus 
      on A1C and severe hypoglycaemia outcomes. For each pairwise treatment comparison, we 
      will combine all IPD from all studies in a single multilevel model, where each study 
      is a different cluster. For a connected network of trials, we will perform an 
      IPD-NMA to identify potential effect modifiers, and estimate the most effective and 
      safe treatments for patients with different characteristics. If we are not 
      successful in obtaining IPD for at least one study, we will include aggregated data 
      (AD) abstracted from the included RCTs in our analysis, combining IPD and AD into a 
      single model. We will report our results using the PRISMA-IPD statement. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The results of this systematic review and IPD-NMA will be of interest 
      to stakeholders and will help in improving existing guideline recommendations.

TI  - First-line therapy for non-transplant eligible patients with multiple myeloma: 
      direct and adjusted indirect comparison of treatment regimens on the existing market 
      in Germany.
PG  - 257-65
LID - 10.1007/s00228-015-1998-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare approved first-line therapies 
      for patients with multiple myeloma. METHODS: A systematic literature search for 
      phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing first-line chemotherapies 
      approved in Germany and recommended by guidelines at the time of study design was 
      conducted. Random-effects meta-analysis (MA) was used for direct and the Bucher 
      method for adjusted indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: One RCT comparing 
      melphalan and prednisone plus bortezomib (VMP) vs. melphalan and prednisone (MP) and 
      six RCTs comparing MP plus thalidomide (MPT) vs. MP were analysed. For MPT vs. MP, 
      an individual patient data (IPD) MA was used for sensitivity analyses. VMP and MPT 
      were superior to MP regarding efficacy endpoints (VMP vs. MP, overall survival (OS): 
      hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.86; progression-free 
      survival (PFS): HR 0.56, 0.39-0.79; complete response (CR), risk-ratio (RR) for 
      non-response: 0.70, 0.65-0.75; MPT vs. MP, OS: HR 0.83, 0.66-1.03; PFS: HR 0.67, 
      0.56-0.81; CR, RR for non-response 0.92, 0.88-0.95); but had a higher risk of 
      developing any grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) (VMP vs. MP: RR 1.13, 1.06-1.20; MPT 
      vs. MP: RR 2.06, 1.43-2.98). The indirect comparison of VMP vs. MPT via MP showed a 
      statistically not significant advantage for VMP regarding survival outcomes (OS: HR 
      0.85, 0.63-1.14; PFS: HR 0.83, 0.56-1.23) and a significant advantage regarding CR 
      (RR for non-response 0.76, 0.70-0.83) and AEs (RR 0.55, 0.38-0.80). Treatment 
      comparisons using results of IPD MA yielded similar effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: VMP 
      and MPT seem more effective than MP, VMP was superior to MPT regarding response 
      criteria and AEs. Our results may best be confirmed by a head-to-head trial of VMP 
      vs. MPT.

PG  - 351-66
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2015.1128404 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine against 
      different antidepressant monotherapies in patients with major depressive disorder 
      (MDD) with inadequate response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or 
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) therapy. METHODS: A systematic 
      search was conducted for monotherapy studies in patients with MDD with inadequate 
      response to first-line therapy. Treatments included SSRIs, SNRIs, and other 
      antidepressants. Identified studies underwent a three-stage screening/data 
      extraction process and critical appraisal. Adjusted indirect treatment comparisons 
      (ITCs) on systematic literature review outputs were made using Bucher's method, 
      comparing remission rates and withdrawal rates due to adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: 
      Of 27 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, a few studies were of high quality 
      according to the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence checklist. Three 
      studies contributed to an evidence network for quantitative assessment comparing 
      vortioxetine with agomelatine, sertraline, venlafaxine XR, and bupropion SR. 
      Vortioxetine had a statistically significantly higher remission rate than 
      agomelatine (risk difference [RD]: -11.0% [95% CI: -19.4; -2.6]), and numerically 
      higher remission rates than sertraline (RD: -14.4% [95% CI: -29.9; 1.1]), 
      venlafaxine (RD: -7.20% [95% CI: -24.3; 9.9]), and bupropion (RD: -10.70% [95% CI: 
      -27.8; 6.4]). Withdrawal rates due to AEs were statistically significantly lower for 
      vortioxetine than sertraline (RD: 12.1% [95% CI: 3.1; 21.1]), venlafaxine XR (RD: 
      12.3% [95% CI: 0.8; 23.8]), and bupropion SR (RD: 18.3% [95% CI: 6.4; 30.1]). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic literature review found a few high quality 
      switch studies assessing monotherapies in patients with MDD with inadequate response 
      to SSRI/SNRIs. ITCs indicated that switching to vortioxetine leads to numerically 
      higher remission rates compared with other antidepressants. Vortioxetine is a well 
      tolerated treatment, showing statistically lower withdrawal rates due to AEs 
      compared with other antidepressants. Vortioxetine is a relevant therapeutic 
      alternative in patients experiencing inadequate response to prior SSRI or SNRI 
      therapy.

TI  - An Indirect Comparison of Everolimus Versus Axitinib in US Patients With Advanced 
      Renal Cell Carcinoma in Whom Prior Sunitinib Therapy Failed.

LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2015.09.013 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform a weight-adjusted indirect 
      comparison to approximate the relative efficacy of everolimus versus axitinib among 
      patients with second-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma in whom sunitinib therapy 
      previously failed. METHODS: Individual patient data from the RECORD-1 (Renal Cell 
      Cancer Treatment With Oral RAD001 Given Daily) Phase III clinical trial provided 
      information for patients taking everolimus. Summary baseline clinical and 
      demographic characteristics and progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes were 
      available for patients taking axitinib who were included in the AXIS (axitinib 
      versus sorafenib) Phase III clinical trial. A Bayesian latent class mixture model 
      differentiating responders and nonresponders and with imbedded Weibull regression on 
      PFS was used to identify sex, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk score, and 
      time receiving prior sunitinib therapy as prognostic factors for PFS based on 
      posterior probability >95%. Patients taking everolimus were weighted up or down 
      based on their combination of prognostic variables. Weights were calculated by 
      dividing the proportion of patients observed in AXIS for a given characteristic by 
      the proportion observed in RECORD-1 and taking the product of the values derived for 
      all three weighting variables considered. Weighted PFS distributions were derived 
      with bootstrapped 95% CIs and compared with those reported for the AXIS trial. 
      FINDINGS: After weighting, distributions of the 3 key baseline characteristics were 
      more closely aligned between the 2 studies; however, some differences remained. A 
      slightly lower rate of poor-risk patients was evident in RECORD-1 (30%) versus AXIS 
      (36%), and a 9% lower proportion of males was observed in the everolimus group 
      compared with the axitinib group. Distributions of time receiving prior sunitinib 
      therapy were almost equivalent between the treatment arms. A median PFS of 4.7 
      months (95% CI, 3.5-10.6 months) was observed for patients in the weighted 
      everolimus group compared with 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.5-6.4 months) in the AXIS 
      trial. IMPLICATIONS: Similar median PFS point estimates and overlapping CIs suggest 
      that everolimus and axitinib have similar efficacy. Although these results do not 
      negate the need for direct comparison, this study may be used to inform clinical and 
      reimbursement decisions until such evidence is available.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials in rare diseases are difficult to conduct due to the 
      limited number of patients available with each disorder. We developed a Phase 2 
      trial which is a small n sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (snSMART) 
      design to test several treatments for a rare disease for which no standard therapy 
      exists. PURPOSE: This paper illustrates the design, sample size estimation and 
      operating characteristics of an snSMART. METHODS: We investigate the performance of 
      a class of weighted Z statistics via computer simulations. RESULTS: We demonstrate 
      the increase in power over traditional single stage designs, and indicate how the 
      power changes as a function of the weight given to each stage. CONCLUSION: The 
      snSMART design is promising in a rare disease setting where several alternative 
      treatments are under consideration and small sample sizes are necessary.

TI  - Trial-based cost-effectiveness of abatacept for rheumatoid arthritis patients in 
      Italy.
PG  - 409-17
LID - 10.1586/14737167.2016.1102636 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory disorder leading 
      to disability and reduced quality of life. Effective treatment is a significant 
      economic burden on the Italian healthcare system. Economic models in RA are commonly 
      based on indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: This study assessed the 
      cost-effectiveness of abatacept relative to adalimumab for RA in Italy based on a 
      head-to-head trial by means of a cost-consequence analysis. RESULTS: Health benefits 
      based on the most stringent efficacy criteria were in favor of abatacept compared to 
      adalimumab. Rates for more costly adverse events were higher for adalimumab compared 
      to abatacept, which was reflected in the lower costs for abatacept (-€237,246 or 
      -€237per patient). CONCLUSION: The health economic value of abatacept compared with 
      adalimumab from the perspective of the Italian NHS depends on the choice of health 
      outcome. Health gains with abatacept were generally based on more stringent criteria 
      and lower total costs.

LID - S0149-2918(15)01103-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2015.09.005 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
      apixaban 5 mg BID versus high- and low-dose edoxaban (60 mg and 30 mg once daily) as 
      intended starting dose strategies for stroke prevention in patients from a UK 
      National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A previously developed and validated 
      Markov model was adapted to evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic impact of 
      apixaban 5 mg BID versus edoxaban (high and low dose) in patients with nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation. A pairwise indirect treatment comparison was conducted for 
      clinical end points, and price parity was assumed between apixaban and edoxaban. 
      Costs in 2012 British pounds, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
      gained, discounted at 3.5% per annum, were estimated. FINDINGS: Apixaban was 
      predicted to increase life expectancy and QALYs versus low- and high-dose edoxaban. 
      These gains were achieved at cost-savings versus low-dose edoxaban, thus being 
      dominant and nominal increases in costs versus high-dose edoxaban. The incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio of apixaban versus high-dose edoxaban was £6763 per QALY 
      gained. IMPLICATIONS: Apixaban was deemed to be dominant (less costly and more 
      effective) versus low-dose edoxaban and a cost-effective alternative to high-dose 
      edoxaban.

TI  - Indirect comparison of the antiviral efficacy of peginterferon alpha 2a plus 
      ribavirin used with or without simeprevir in genotype 4 hepatitis C virus infection, 
      where common comparator study arms are lacking: a special application of the 
      matching adjusted indirect comparison methodology.
PG  - 147-54

AB  - BACKGROUND: The need to assess relative efficacy in the absence of comparative 
      clinical trials is a problem that is often encountered in economic modeling. The use 
      of matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) in this situation has been 
      suggested. We present the results of a MAIC used to evaluate the incremental benefit 
      offered by adding simeprevir (SMV) to standard therapy in the treatment of patients 
      infected with genotype 4 hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: Individual patient data 
      for a single arm study evaluating the use of SMV with peginterferon alfa 
      2a + ribavirin (PR) in genotype 4 HCV were available (RESTORE study). A systematic 
      literature review was used to identify studies of PR alone used in the same patient 
      group. By applying the inclusion criteria for each study in turn to the RESTORE 
      dataset and then applying the published MAIC covariate matching algorithm, a series 
      of pseudosamples from RESTORE were generated. After assessment of the matching 
      outcomes, the best matched comparisons were used to derive estimates of efficacy for 
      SMV + PR in patients equivalent to those participating in the PR trial. RESULTS: 
      Five potential comparator studies were identified. After applying the matching 
      process, two emerged as offering the greatest equivalence with the generated RESTORE 
      pseudosamples and were used to estimate SMV + PR efficacy, expressed as the 
      percentage of patients achieving sustained viral response (SVR). In one comparison, 
      SVR in the SMV + PR group was 85% versus 63% for PR alone. In the second comparison, 
      the corresponding SVRs were 77% and 44% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After matching 
      for varying baseline characteristics, both comparisons of RESTORE versus studies of 
      PR alone yielded a benefit for SMV + PR vs PR alone in genotype 4 HCV-infected 
      patients. The incremental gain in SVR associated with use of SMV ranged from 22% to 
      33%. In the absence of direct comparative studies, the MAIC gives a better 
      perspective than simple comparison of absolute SVR from individual studies.

BTI - Vortioxetine (Addendum to Commission A15-16)
AB  - Background On 8 September 2015, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned the 
      Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to conduct a 
      supplementary assessment for Commission A15-16 (Vortioxetine – Benefit Assessment 
      According to §35a Social Code Book (SGB) V). In the dossier on vortioxetine for the 
      assessment of the acute treatment of patients with moderate and severe major 
      depressive episodes, the pharmaceutical company (hereinafter referred as “the 
      company”) had presented an adjusted indirect comparison in comparison with the 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram using a common comparator 
      placebo. The dossier assessment on vortioxetine showed that the results presented by 
      the company were unsuitable for the assessment of the added benefit of vortioxetine. 
      This was largely due to the fact that the company made an inadequate limitation of 
      the study pool for the meta-analyses of the indirect comparison and did not consider 
      the available evidence completely. In its comment, the company submitted 
      supplementary analyses on the indirect comparison, which went beyond the information 
      provided in the dossier. Moreover, the company in its comments referred to a study 
      of direct comparison of vortioxetine versus the SSRI escitalopram (study 318), which 
      the company had not included in the dossier for the assessment of the added benefit. 
      The G-BA commissioned IQWiG with the assessment of the additional data on the 
      indirect comparison and of study 318. The responsibility for the present assessment 
      and the results of the assessment lies exclusively with IQWiG. The assessment is 
      forwarded to the G-BA. The G-BA decides on the added benefit.

TI  - Daclatasvir + sofosbuvir versus standard of care for hepatitis C genotype 3: a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 129-39
LID - 10.2217/cer.15.49 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir (DCV + 
      SOF) versus SOF and ribavirin (SOF + R) and versus peginterferon-alfa plus ribavirin 
      (A/R) in patients infected with hepatitis C genotype 3. PATIENTS & METHODS: Clinical 
      trials of SOF + R or A/R were identified in systematic literature reviews. The 
      DCV+SOF population was adjusted via propensity score weighting to match average 
      baseline characteristics to those reported for the comparator regimens. RESULTS: The 
      SVR12 rate was similar between DCV + SOF and SOF + R, and significantly higher with 
      DCV + SOF than A/R. Rates of discontinuation due to AEs were similar or 
      significantly lower in patients treated with DCV + SOF than SOF + R or A/R. 
      CONCLUSION: With its high efficacy and improved tolerability, DCV + SOF is an 
      important treatment for hepatitis C genotype 3.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of estradiol transdermal preparations for the 
      treatment of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women: an indirect comparison 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 294-303
LID - 10.1097/GME.0000000000000552 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Divigel and Estrogel are estradiol gels for the treatment of 
      postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. They differ with 
      respect to several factors including estradiol concentration and surface 
      application, and cannot be compared solely on the basis of their estradiol dose. No 
      randomized clinical trials have compared them head to head, but both have been 
      compared with placebo. Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct a 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis of the two estradiol gels. METHODS: We 
      performed a comprehensive systematic literature review. One publication reporting on 
      one Divigel trial, three publications reporting on two Estrogel trials, and five 
      publications reporting on other estradiol transdermal preparations were identified. 
      Efficacy outcomes were change from baseline in daily hot flush frequency and change 
      from baseline in daily hot flush severity. Safety outcomes were frequency of 
      treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and frequency of treatment-emergent AEs 
      leading to discontinuation. Bayesian indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis of 
      trial-level data was performed in accordance with the International Society for 
      Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, National 
      Pharmaceutical Council (ISPOR-AMCP-NPC) Good Practice Questionnaire. All outcomes 
      were compared with respect to doses of the considered preparations. RESULTS: For hot 
      flush frequency, Divigel 0.25 mg was similar to Divigel 0.5 mg and to Estrogel 
      0.75 mg, and was statistically significantly superior to Estrogel 1.5 mg. The 
      largest effect was observed with Divigel 1.0 mg (mean difference of 3.91 hot 
      flushes/wk vs placebo), and was statistically significantly superior to all other 
      interventions. The 1.5 mg Estrogel dose was associated with the smallest estimate of 
      efficacy. For hot flush severity, Divigel 0.25 mg was similar to the efficacy of 
      Divigel 0.5 mg, and for 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg of other estradiol gels, but was 
      statistically inferior to Divigel 1.0 mg, Estrogel 0.75 mg, Estrogel 1.5 mg, and the 
      1.0 and 1.5 mg doses of all other estradiol gels. The estimated efficacy of Divigel 
      0.5 mg was similar to that of Estrogel 0.75 mg, Estrogel 1.5 mg, and the 0.25 and 
      0.5 mg doses of other transdermal estradiol preparations. Risks of treatment-related 
      AEs for Divigel 0.25 mg, Divigel 0.5 mg, Estrogel 0.75 mg, and Estrogel 1.5 mg were 
      similar and all were of a slightly higher risk than placebo. Among these, Divigel 
      1.0 mg, Estrogel 1.5 mg, and other gels 0.5 mg were statistically significantly less 
      safe than placebo. However, for treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation, 
      none of the gels were associated with statistically significantly higher relative 
      risks compared with placebo. In this study, statistically significant refers to the 
      95% credible intervals used in the Bayesian Network Analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Using 
      network meta-analysis for indirect treatment comparison, we have shown that the 
      efficacy of Divigel 0.25 mg, as measured by reduced hot flush frequency and 
      severity, was similar to that of Divigel 0.5 mg and of Estrogel 0.75 and 1.5 mg. 
      Overall, our analysis showed that Divigel 1.0 mg provided the best efficacy profile, 
      but that this treatment was also associated with a higher risk of AEs. The network 
      meta-analysis also showed that treatment with Estrogel 1.5 mg was associated with 
      the smallest estimate of reduction in frequency of hot flushes.

TI  - New methods for treatment effect calibration, with applications to non-inferiority 
      trials.
PG  - 20-9
LID - 10.1111/biom.12388 [doi]
AB  - In comparative effectiveness research, it is often of interest to calibrate 
      treatment effect estimates from a clinical trial to a target population that differs 
      from the study population. One important application is an indirect comparison of a 
      new treatment with a placebo control on the basis of two separate randomized 
      clinical trials: a non-inferiority trial comparing the new treatment with an active 
      control and a historical trial comparing the active control with placebo. The 
      available methods for treatment effect calibration include an outcome regression 
      (OR) method based on a regression model for the outcome and a weighting method based 
      on a propensity score (PS) model. This article proposes new methods for treatment 
      effect calibration: one based on a conditional effect (CE) model and two doubly 
      robust (DR) methods. The first DR method involves a PS model and an OR model, is 
      asymptotically valid if either model is correct, and attains the semiparametric 
      information bound if both models are correct. The second DR method involves a PS 
      model, a CE model, and possibly an OR model, is asymptotically valid under the union 
      of the PS and CE models, and attains the semiparametric information bound if all 
      three models are correct. The various methods are compared in a simulation study and 
      applied to recent clinical trials for treating human immunodeficiency virus 
      infection.

TI  - Efficacy of Supplementation with B Vitamins for Stroke Prevention: A Network 
      Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - e0137533
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0137533 [doi]
LID - e0137533
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supplementation with B vitamins for stroke prevention has been evaluated 
      over the years, but which combination of B vitamins is optimal for stroke prevention 
      is unclear. We performed a network meta-analysis to assess the impact of different 
      combinations of B vitamins on risk of stroke. METHODS: A total of 17 trials (86 393 
      patients) comparing 7 treatment strategies and placebo were included. A network 
      meta-analysis combined all available direct and indirect treatment comparisons to 
      evaluate the efficacy of B vitamin supplementation for all interventions. RESULTS: B 
      vitamin supplementation was associated with reduced risk of stroke and cerebral 
      hemorrhage. The risk of stroke was lower with folic acid plus vitamin B6 as compared 
      with folic acid plus vitamin B12 and was lower with folic acid plus vitamin B6 plus 
      vitamin B12 as compared with placebo or folic acid plus vitamin B12. The treatments 
      ranked in order of efficacy for stroke, from higher to lower, were folic acid plus 
      vitamin B6 > folic acid > folic acid plus vitamin B6 plus vitamin B12 > vitamin B6 
      plus vitamin B12 > niacin > vitamin B6 > placebo > folic acid plus vitamin B12. 
      CONCLUSIONS: B vitamin supplementation was associated with reduced risk of stroke; 
      different B vitamins and their combined treatments had different efficacy on stroke 
      prevention. Folic acid plus vitamin B6 might be the optimal therapy for stroke 
      prevention. Folic acid and vitamin B6 were both valuable for stroke prevention. The 
      efficacy of vitamin B12 remains to be studied.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of antiviral therapy in preventing vertical transmission of 
      hepatitis B: a network meta-analysis.
PG  - 634-41
LID - 10.1111/liv.12959 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Antiviral drugs are safe and effective in the third trimester to 
      prevent intrauterine transmission of hepatitis B virus, and are recommended for 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected gravid mothers (between weeks 28 and 32) with high 
      viral load, followed by postnatal hepatitis B immunization in the newborn. We 
      estimated the comparative efficacy of antiviral drugs for prevention of vertical 
      transmission of HBV, through a network meta-analysis of clinical trials. METHODS: We 
      conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and published proceedings from 
      major liver meetings from January 1980 to November 2014. We conducted pair-wise 
      meta-analyses and Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, 
      combining direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. RESULTS: 
      Seventeen clinical trials involving 2764 newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen 
      seropositive mothers were eligible for analysis. There were no clinical trials 
      involving tenofovir or entecavir. On pair-wise meta-analyses, telbivudine (hazard 
      ratio, HR 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.37; I(2)  = 0%), and Lamivudine 
      (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24-0.65; I(2)  = 0%), were more effective than placebo in 
      reducing vertical transmission of HBV in high viremic hepatitis B e antigen 
      (HBeAg)-positive chronic Hepatitis B Chinese patients. Sensitivity analyses limited 
      to studies with HBeAg seropositive mothers revealed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Based on a Bayesian network meta-analysis of clinical trials, combining direct and 
      indirect treatment comparisons, telbivudine appears to be more effective than 
      Lamivudine for preventing vertical transmission of HBV infection. Trials assessing 
      the efficacy of tenofovir or entecavir compared to placebo or other antiviral drugs 
      are lacking.

      stage non-small cell lung cancer.

LID - 10.2147/OTT.S88700 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many clinical trials have confirmed that postoperative adjuvant therapy 
      can prolong survival of non-small cell lung cancer. However, the efficiency of 
      postoperative chemotherapy without radiotherapy is unclear, especially in early 
      stage (stages I and II). We aimed to assess the effect of postoperative chemotherapy 
      without radiotherapy in early stage patients. METHODS: Databases and manual searches 
      were adopted to identify eligible randomized control trials. Hazard ratio (HR) was 
      used to assess the advantage of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival 
      (OS) by fixed or random-effects models. RESULTS: Fourteen trials with 3,923 patients 
      were included based on inclusion criteria. Compared with surgery alone, 
      postoperative chemotherapy significantly improved DFS and OS with HR of 0.71 
      (P=0.005) and 0.74 (P<0.00001), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed both 
      cisplatin-based (HR: 0.75, P<0.0001) and single tegafur-uracil (UFT) chemotherapy 
      (HR: 0.72, P=0.002) yielded significant survival benefits, but the latter did not 
      improve DFS (HR: 1.04, P=0.81). Indirect treatment comparison showed cisplatin-based 
      chemotherapy was superior to single UFT in DFS, but comparable in OS. The benefits 
      of postoperative chemotherapy were maintained in patients in stage I (HR: 0.74, 
      P<0.00001) and IB (HR: 0.74, P=0.0003), but not in stage IA, although the trend 
      supported chemotherapy (HR: 0.76, P=0.43). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis 
      demonstrates that postoperative chemotherapy without radiotherapy improves survival 
      of stage I-II, I, and IB non-small cell lung cancer patients, but not for IA. 
      Meanwhile, efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is comparable to single UFT in 
      OS, but better in DFS, which should be paid more attention in future clinical 
      practice.

TI  - Adjuvant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma 
      after curative treatment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 100-10
LID - 10.1111/hepr.12584 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether adjuvant antiviral treatment could improve prognosis and 
      entecavir is the optimal nucleoside/nucleotide analog (NA) regimen after curative 
      therapy of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: 
      A comprehensive electronic search was performed. All controlled trials comparing 
      antiviral treatment with placebo or no treatment for HBV-related HCC after curative 
      treatment were included. The pooled hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CI) were calculated using Stata 12.0 software. An indirect treatment comparison 
      method was used to compare the relative efficacy of different NA strategies. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-one studies containing 8072 patients were included. NA was found to 
      significantly improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). 
      Alternatively, for interferon, a non-significant benefit was found. By adjusted 
      indirect comparisons among entecavir, lamivudine and adefovir, entecavir were found 
      to display almost but not significant superiority to the other NA in improving RFS. 
      No tendency favoring a specific NA regimen was found for OS. CONCLUSION: In HBV-HCC 
      patient after curative treatment, NA improve the prognosis significantly but the 
      role of interferon remains to be elucidated; entecavir was not found to be superior 
      to other NA based on available data.

TI  - Randomized controlled trials in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 666-78
LID - 10.1177/1078155215603230 [doi]
AB  - This systematic literature review evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of 
      interventions used in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. Primary efficacy 
      outcomes were objective response rate, progression-free survival and overall 
      survival. Safety endpoints were grade 3/4 toxicities, serious adverse events and 
      withdrawals or deaths due to toxicity. Studies were selected if they were randomized 
      controlled trials reporting on the efficacy or safety of treatments for relapsed or 
      refractory follicular lymphoma, and if outcomes were reported separately from trials 
      that included other lymphoid neoplasms. We used the Bucher method for conducting 
      adjusted indirect comparisons within a meta-analysis. We identified 10 randomized 
      controlled trials of treatments for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. The 
      most prominent drug investigated (alone or in combination) was rituximab. Most 
      trials did not report median overall survival. Two trials reported median event-free 
      survival (range, 1.2-23.2 months). Six of ten trials reported objective response 
      rate (range, 9-93%). Meta-analysis showed only one statistically significant result: 
      rituximab + bortezomib yielded a significantly higher objective response rate than 
      rituximab monotherapy (relative risk, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.47). 
      Otherwise, there were no discernable differences in overall survival or 
      progression-free survival, partly due to insufficient reporting of results in the 
      clinical trials. The relatively small number of randomized controlled trials, few 
      overlapping treatment arms, and variability in the randomized controlled trial 
      features and in the endpoints studied complicate the formal comparison of therapies 
      for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. Additional well-designed randomized 
      controlled trials are needed to fully understand the relative outcomes of older and 
      more recently developed therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Section 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 
      1997 regulates the promotion of health economic information by pharmaceutical 
      companies to US health plans. Greater clarity is important given demands by payers 
      and other stakeholders for evidence of value. OBJECTIVES: To develop hypothetical 
      case studies of health economic promotions to examine legal and policy implications. 
      METHODS: We constructed for pedagogical purposes 10 categories of potential health 
      economic promotions. We generated hypothetical case studies for each category, 
      including questions about whether each might be allowable under Section 114. The 
      case studies were developed around the following categories: 1) costing out on-label 
      clinical end points; 2) promotion of a costing exercise to physicians working in an 
      accountable care organization setting; 3) burden-of-illness claims; 4) economic 
      analysis of a formulary restriction policy; 5) extrapolations to doses, populations, 
      or settings not covered in trials; 6) adherence claims; 7) "utilization of care" as 
      a secondary end point in randomized clinical trials; 8) costing out a competitor 
      drug's adverse event; 9) economic analysis of comparative effectiveness claims using 
      an indirect treatment comparison; and 10) extrapolating from surrogate to long-term 
      outcomes in an economic model. DISCUSSION: Most cases seem to fall into a gray zone 
      given haziness around what constitutes "competent and reliable evidence" and 
      "directly relate[d]" to an approved indication. In practice, it is difficult to know 
      what the section allows given the imprecision of the statute and lack of guidance 
      about its scope. CONCLUSION: Ideally, future guidance will provide clarity and 
      flexibility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intranasal and buccal midazolam have recently emerged as possible 
      alternatives to intravenous or rectal diazepam or intravenous lorazepam in the 
      treatment of early status epilepticus (SE). However, to date no randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) has directly compared intranasal midazolam with buccal 
      midazolam. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to indirectly compare intranasal 
      midazolam with buccal midazolam in the treatment of early SE using common 
      reference-based indirect comparison meta-analyses. METHODS: RCTs comparing 
      intranasal or buccal midazolam versus either intravenous or rectal diazepam for 
      early SE were systematically searched. Random-effects Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses 
      were performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for the efficacy and safety of intranasal 
      or buccal midazolam versus either intravenous or rectal diazepam. Adjusted indirect 
      comparisons were then made between intranasal and buccal midazolam using the 
      obtained results. RESULTS: Fifteen studies, with a total of 1662 seizures in 1331 
      patients (some studies included patients with more than one episode of SE) were 
      included; 1303 patients were younger than 16 years. Indirect comparisons showed no 
      difference between intranasal and buccal midazolam for seizure cessation (OR 0.98, 
      95% CI 0.32-3.01, comparator: intravenous diazepam; OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.46-1.64, 
      comparator: rectal diazepam). For serious adverse effects, we found a large width 
      and asymmetrical distribution of confidence intervals around the obtained OR of 2.81 
      (95% CI 0.39-20.12; comparator: rectal diazepam). No data were available for OR 
      using intravenous diazepam as the comparator. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons 
      suggest that intranasal and buccal midazolam share similar efficacy in the treatment 
      of early SE in children. Intranasal midazolam should be used with caution and under 
      clinical monitoring of vital functions. RCTs directly comparing intranasal midazolam 
      with buccal midazolam are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis is an increasingly used approach for 
      synthesizing and investigating treatment effect estimates. Over the past few years, 
      numerous methods for conducting an IPD meta-analysis (IPD-MA) have been proposed, 
      often making different assumptions and modeling choices while addressing a similar 
      research question. We conducted a literature review to provide an overview of 
      methods for performing an IPD-MA using evidence from clinical trials or 
      non-randomized studies when investigating treatment efficacy. With this review, we 
      aim to assist researchers in choosing the appropriate methods and provide 
      recommendations on their implementation when planning and conducting an IPD-MA.

TI  - Effects of Statin Treatment on Inflammation and Cardiac Function in Heart Failure: 
      An Adjusted Indirect Comparison Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.
PG  - 338-46
LID - 10.1111/1755-5922.12150 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Statins are known to prevent heart failure (HF). However, it is 
      unclear whether statins as class or type (lipophilic or hydrophilic) improve 
      outcomes of established HF. AIMS: The current meta-analysis was performed to compare 
      the treatment effects of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins on inflammation and 
      cardiac function in HF. Outcomes were indicators of cardiac function [changes in 
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)] and 
      inflammation [changes in highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and 
      interluekin-6 (IL-6)]. METHOD: We conducted a search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the 
      Cochrane databases until December 31, 2014 for randomized control trials (RCTs) of 
      statin versus placebo in patients with HF. RCTs with their respective extracted 
      information were dichotomized into statin type evaluated and analyzed separately. 
      Outcomes were pooled with random effect approach, producing standardized mean 
      differences (SMD) for each statin type. Using these pooled estimates, we performed 
      adjusted indirect comparisons for each outcome. RESULTS: Data from 6214 patients 
      from 19 trials were analyzed. Lipophilic statin was superior to hydrophilic statin 
      treatment regarding follow-up LVEF (SMD, 4.54; 95% CI, 4.16-4.91; P < 0.001), BNP 
      (SMD, -1.60; 95% CI, -2.56 to -0.65; P < 0.001), hsCRP (SMD, -1.13; 95% CI, -1.54 to 
      -0.72; P < 0.001), and IL-6 (SMD, -3.75; 95% CI, -4.77 to -0.72; P < 0.001) in HF. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Lipophilic statin produces greater treatment effects on cardiac 
      function and inflammation compared with hydrophilic statin in patients with HF. 
      Until data from adequately powered head-to-head trial of the statin types are 
      available, our meta-analysis brings clinicians and researchers a step closer to the 
      quest on which statin--lipophilic or hydrophilic--is associated with better outcomes 
      in HF.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - 1417-32
LID - 10.1002/hep.27999 [doi]
AB  - We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect 
      treatment comparisons to assess the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological 
      agents for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Through systematic 
      literature review, we identified nine randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) including 
      964 patients with biopsy-proven NASH, comparing vitamin E, thiazolidinediones 
      (TZDs), pentoxifylline, or obeticholic acid to one another or placebo. The primary 
      outcome was improvement in fibrosis stage; secondary outcomes were improvement in 
      ballooning degeneration, lobular inflammation, and steatosis. We reported relative 
      risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from direct meta-analysis and 95% 
      credible intervals (CrIs) from Bayesian network meta-analysis, and used Grading of 
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise 
      quality of evidence. Moderate-quality evidence supports the use of pentoxifylline 
      (RR, 0.26; 95% CrI: 0.05-1.00) and obeticholic acid (RR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) 
      over placebo in improving fibrosis. High-quality evidence supports the effect of 
      vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic acid over placebo in improving ballooning 
      degeneration. All four interventions seemed to have at least moderate-quality 
      evidence over placebo to improve steatosis. Moderate-quality evidence supports that 
      TZDs, pentoxifylline, and obeticholic acid decrease lobular inflammation. All the 
      head-to-head comparisons were supported by very-low-quality evidence except for 
      superiority of TZDs over vitamin E on improving steatosis and lobular inflammation, 
      which had moderate-quality evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Based on direct and network 
      meta-analysis, pentoxifylline and obeticholic acid improve fibrosis, and vitamin E, 
      TZDs, and obeticholic acid improve ballooning degeneration in patients with NASH. 
      Future comparative trials of combination therapies targeting distinct histological 
      features are warranted.

      in genotype 1b hepatitis C virus infection.
PG  - 593-605
LID - 10.2217/cer.15.33 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Efficacy and safety comparison of daclatasvir/asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) versus 
      peginterferon-α/ribavirin (A/R) alone or combined with telaprevir, boceprevir, 
      simeprevir or sofosbuvir in chronic genotype 1b hepatitis C virus infection. 
      METHODS: Network meta-analysis (NMA) and matching-adjusted indirect comparisons 
      (MAICs). RESULTS: Among treatment-naive patients, DCV + ASV demonstrated higher 
      sustained virologic response (SVR) rates than telaprevir + A/R, boceprevir + A/R and 
      A/R in NMA and MAICs and simeprevir + A/R in NMA. DCV + ASV among 
      treatment-experienced patients had higher SVR rates than telaprevir + A/R, 
      boceprevir + A/R, simeprevir + A/R and A/R in MAICs. DCV + ASV had lower adverse 
      events rates than comparators. CONCLUSION: DCV + ASV demonstrated superior efficacy 
      and safety compared with A/R-based regimens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Certolizumab pegol, a PEGylated tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor, 
      improves the clinical signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when used in 
      combination with methotrexate or as monotherapy. This study evaluatedthe 
      cost-utility of certolizumab pegol versusTNF-inhibitors plus methotrexate in the 
      treatment of moderate-to-severe RA in Spain. METHODS: A Markov cohort health state 
      transition model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility (costs and 
      quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of certolizumab pegol versus other 
      TNF-inhibitors licensed in Spain in 2009. Efficacy was measured using the American 
      College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses at 6 months, based on adjusted indirect 
      comparisons from published clinical trials. Utilities were derived from EQ-5D data 
      from certolizumab pegol RA clinical trials. Clinical history and resource use data 
      came from published literature. Unit costs were taken from Spanish databases or 
      published data (cost year 2009). Base case analyses were conducted from the payer 
      perspective, with a lifetime horizon, 3.5 % annual discounting rates for costs and 
      outcomes, and 3 % inflation rate for 2009 onwards. One-way sensitivity analyses were 
      conducted. RESULTS: The average lifetime costs for certolizumab pegol, etanercept, 
      adalimumab (every 2 weeks and weekly) and infliximab (3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) in 
      combination with methotrexate were €140,971, €141,197, €139,148, €164,741, €136,961 
      and €152,561, respectively. The QALYs gained were 6.578, 6.462, 6.430 (for both 
      adalimumab doses), 6.430, and 6.318 (for both infliximab doses), respectively. At a 
      €30,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, certolizumab pegol plus methotrexate 
      dominated adalimumab weekly, etanercept, and infliximab 5 mg/kg, and was 
      cost-effective versus adalimumab every 2 weeks and infliximab 3 mg/kg (all with 
      methotrexate), with estimated ICERs of €12,346/QALY and €15,414/QALY, respectively. 
      Certolizumab pegol monotherapy was more cost-effective versus adalimumab, and less 
      expensive with similar health gains versus etanercept (6.416 QALYs vs 6.492). 
      Univariate analysis showed ICERs to be sensitive to changes in time horizon, ACR 
      response time point, baseline Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, and rate 
      of HAQ-disability index deterioration after discontinuing treatment. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This analysis shows that certolizumab pegol is cost-effective compared with other 
      TNF-inhibitors recommended in Spain for the treatment of RA.

BTI - Dulaglutide (Addendum to Commission A15-07)
AB  - Background On 9 June 2015, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned the 
      Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to conduct a 
      supplementary assessment for Commission A15-07 (Dulaglutide – Benefit assessment 
      according to §35a Social Code Book [SGB] V). In Dossier Assessment A15-07, the 
      pharmaceutical company (hereinafter referred to as "the company") presented, among 
      other things, 3 adjusted indirect comparisons using the common comparator 
      sitagliptin + metformin for research question B (dulaglutide in dual combination 
      with an oral antidiabetic [OAD]). The indirect comparison with the HARMONY 3 study 
      was used for the assessment. The indirect comparisons with the studies Arechavaleta 
      (2011) and Nauck (2007) / Seck (2010) were unsuitable for the benefit assessment 
      also because relevant data were not considered in the analyses presented by the 
      company, and therefore no adequate balancing of positive and negative effects on the 
      basis of these 2 indirect comparisons was possible. The company presented further 
      documents for the indirect comparison using the study Nauck (2007) / Seck (2010) in 
      the framework of the commenting procedure on the early benefit assessment of 
      dulaglutide. This indirect comparison investigated the added benefit of dulaglutide 
      + metformin versus the sulfonylurea glipizide, which is not approved in Germany. The 
      G-BA commissioned IQWiG to assess these documents. The responsibility for the 
      present assessment and the results of the assessment lies exclusively with IQWiG. 
      The assessment is forwarded to the G-BA. The G-BA decides on the added benefit.

BTI - Dasabuvir and Ombitasvir / Paritaprevir / Ritonavir (Addendum to Commissions A15-03 
      and A15-04)
AB  - On 11 June 2015, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned the Institute for 
      Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to conduct a supplementary assessment 
      for the commissions A15-03 (Dasabuvir – Benefit assessment according to §35a Social 
      Code Book V) and A15-04 (Ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir – Benefit assessment 
      according to §35a Social Code Book V). With its comment, the pharmaceutical company 
      (hereinafter referred to as “the company”) presented further information on results 
      of an adjusted indirect comparison of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir in 
      combination with dasabuvir (OBV / PTV / R + DSV) versus triple therapy of 
      telaprevir, peginterferon and ribavirin (TVR + PEG + RBV) in treatment-experienced 
      patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1b without cirrhosis (research 
      question 4 of the dossier assessment). The G-BA commissioned IQWiG to assess the 
      information on this indirect comparison (including information on survival time 
      analyses for adverse events [AEs]). Moreover, the company presented further 
      information on survival time analyses for AEs for the following patient groups and 
      comparisons: Research question 1 of the dossier assessment: treatment-naive patients 
      with CHC genotype 1a without cirrhosis (OBV/PTV/R + DSV + RBV versus TVR + PEG + 
      RBV). Research question 2 of the dossier assessment: treatment-naive patients with 
      CHC genotype 1b without cirrhosis (OBV/PTV/R + DSV versus TVR + PEG + RBV). Research 
      question 3 of the dossier assessment: treatment-experienced patients with CHC 
      genotype 1a without cirrhosis (OBV/PTV/R + DSV + RBV versus TVR + PEG + RBV). The 
      G-BA commissioned IQWiG to assess this information on these survival time analyses 
      for AEs. The responsibility for the present assessment and the results of the 
      assessment lies exclusively with IQWiG. The assessment is forwarded to the G-BA. The 
      G-BA decides on the added benefit.

TI  - Influence of point estimates and study power of bioequivalence studies on 
      establishing bioequivalence between generics by adjusted indirect comparisons.
PG  - 1083-9
LID - 10.1007/s00228-015-1889-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Adjusted indirect comparisons can be used to investigate bioequivalence 
      between generic products that are bioequivalent with a common reference product. In 
      previous work with generic tuberculosis medicines prequalified by the WHO, it was 
      observed that although indirect comparisons are an effective approach for confirming 
      the interchangeability of generics, the approach is subject to less precision than 
      direct comparisons. The objective of this investigation was to explore this by 
      examining the influence of point estimates and power of bioequivalence studies 
      versus the reference on the ability to show equivalence in indirect comparisons. 
      METHODS: Power was considered as a determining factor instead of variability and 
      sample size, because sample size is calculated based on variability and desired 
      power. Scenarios were computed combining a range of point estimate differences (0-14 
      %) and statistical power of the studies (50-99.99 %). RESULTS: The indirect 
      comparisons could conclude equivalence between generics only when (a) point estimate 
      differences between generics were low (≤ 5.5 %) for any sufficiently powered study 
      (> 80 %), or (b) the differences were large (but less than 14 %) and both 
      bioequivalence studies were overpowered (e.g., 10 % difference and power ≥ 95 %). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the ability to demonstrate interchangeability between 
      generics is dependent not only on the real differences between the products but also 
      on the design of the original generic vs. reference bioequivalence studies being 
      combined, as earmarked by their respective power.

TI  - Multivariate meta-analysis using individual participant data.
PG  - 157-74
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1129 [doi]
AB  - When combining results across related studies, a multivariate meta-analysis allows 
      the joint synthesis of correlated effect estimates from multiple outcomes. Joint 
      synthesis can improve efficiency over separate univariate syntheses, may reduce 
      selective outcome reporting biases, and enables joint inferences across the 
      outcomes. A common issue is that within-study correlations needed to fit the 
      multivariate model are unknown from published reports. However, provision of 
      individual participant data (IPD) allows them to be calculated directly. Here, we 
      illustrate how to use IPD to estimate within-study correlations, using a joint 
      linear regression for multiple continuous outcomes and bootstrapping methods for 
      binary, survival and mixed outcomes. In a meta-analysis of 10 hypertension trials, 
      we then show how these methods enable multivariate meta-analysis to address novel 
      clinical questions about continuous, survival and binary outcomes; 
      treatment-covariate interactions; adjusted risk/prognostic factor effects; 
      longitudinal data; prognostic and multiparameter models; and multiple treatment 
      comparisons. Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches are applied, with example 
      software code provided to derive within-study correlations and to fit the models.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has high mortality. We assessed 
      the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for severe AH, 
      through a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons. 
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review, through February 2015, for 
      randomized controlled trials of adults with severe AH (discriminant function ≥32 
      and/or hepatic encephalopathy) that compared the efficacy of active pharmacologic 
      interventions (corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, and N-acetylcysteine [NAC], alone or 
      in combination) with each other or placebo, in reducing short-term mortality 
      (primary outcome) and medium-term mortality, acute kidney injury, and/or infections 
      (secondary outcomes). We performed direct and Bayesian network meta-analysis for all 
      treatments, and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and 
      Evaluation criteria to appraise quality of evidence. RESULTS: We included 22 
      randomized controlled trials (2621 patients) comparing 5 different interventions. In 
      a direct meta-analysis, only corticosteroids decreased risk of short-term mortality. 
      In a network meta-analysis, moderate quality evidence supported the use of 
      corticosteroids alone (relative risk [RR], 0.54; 95% credible interval [CrI], 
      0.39-0.73) or in combination with pentoxifylline (RR, 0.53; 95% CrI, 0.36-0.78) or 
      NAC (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.39), to reduce short-term mortality; low quality 
      evidence showed that pentoxifylline also decreased short-term mortality (RR, 0.70; 
      95% CrI, 0.50-0.97). The addition of NAC, but not pentoxifylline, to corticosteroids 
      may be superior to corticosteroids alone for reducing short-term mortality. No 
      treatment was effective in reducing medium-term mortality. Imprecise estimates and 
      the small number of direct trials lowered the confidence in several comparisons. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe AH, pentoxifylline and corticosteroids (alone 
      and in combination with pentoxifylline or NAC) can reduce short-term mortality. No 
      treatment decreases risk of medium-term mortality.

TI  - Investigation into the interchangeability of generic formulations using 
      immunosuppressants and a broad selection of medicines.
PG  - 979-90

AB  - PURPOSE: To date, the interchangeability of generic drugs has only been investigated 
      for a limited number of medicines. The objective of this study was to investigate 
      generic-generic drug interchangeability in a large subset of generic formulations in 
      order to cover a broad spectrum of drugs. METHODS: Orally administered drugs for 
      investigation in this study were selected using strict, predefined criteria, with 
      the purpose to avoid bias. This selection procedure yielded atorvastatin, 
      bicalutamide, naratriptan, olanzapine, perindopril, and venlafaxine. Further, 
      ciclosporin, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil were investigated as test 
      immunosuppressants. Adjusted indirect comparisons were conducted between generic 
      drugs containing the same active substance, and the 90% confidence interval (CI) for 
      AUC and Cmax was calculated. RESULTS: In total, 120 bioequivalence studies were 
      identified in the Dutch medicine regulatory agency's database, allowing 292 indirect 
      comparisons between generic drugs. The indirect comparison results indicated that in 
      the vast majority of cases, i.e., 80.5%, the 90% CIs for both AUCt and Cmax fell 
      within the bioequivalence criteria (in 90.1 and 87.0% for AUCt and Cmax, 
      respectively). In 1% of the 292 indirect comparison for AUCt and 3% for Cmax, a 
      wider range of 75-133% (or 80-125%) was exceeded. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study 
      suggests that exposure-related risks associated with the exchange of different 
      generic drugs in clinical practice are not increased to a relevant extent compared 
      to the situation in which a generic is exchanged with the innovator.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of lurasidone vs quetiapine extended-release (XR) in patients 
      with bipolar depression.
PG  - 821-7
LID - 10.3111/13696998.2015.1052462 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bipolar disorder imposes a high economic burden on patients and society. 
      Lurasidone and quetiapine extended-release (XR) are atypical antipsychotic agents 
      indicated for monotherapy treatment of bipolar depression. Lurasidone is also 
      indicated as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for depressive episodes 
      associated with bipolar disorder. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the 
      cost-effectiveness of lurasidone and quetiapine XR in patients with bipolar 
      depression. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare lurasidone 
      to quetiapine XR. The model was based on a US third-party payer perspective over a 
      3-month time horizon. The effectiveness measure in the model was the percentage of 
      patients achieving remission (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] 
      total score ≤12 by weeks 6-8). The comparison of remission rates was made through an 
      adjusted indirect treatment comparison of lurasidone and quetiapine XR pivotal 
      trials using placebo as the common comparator. Resource utilization for remission vs 
      no remission was estimated from published expert panel data, and resource costs were 
      obtained from a retrospective database study of bipolar I depression patients. Drug 
      costs were estimated using the mean dose from clinical trials and wholesale 
      acquisition costs. RESULTS: Over the 3-month model time period, lurasidone and 
      quetiapine XR patients, respectively, had similar mean numbers of emergency 
      department visits (0.48 vs 0.50), inpatient days (2.1 vs 2.2), and office visits 
      (9.3 vs 9.6). More lurasidone than quetiapine XR patients achieved remission (52.0% 
      vs 43.2%) with slightly higher total costs ($4982 vs $4676), resulting in an 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3474 per remission. The probabilistic 
      sensitivity analysis showed lurasidone had an 86% probability of being 
      cost-effective compared to quetiapine XR at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
      $10,000 per remission. CONCLUSIONS: Lurasidone may be a cost-effective option when 
      compared to quetiapine XR for the treatment of adults with bipolar depression.

TI  - Comparison of glucose lowering effect of metformin and acarbose in type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus: a meta-analysis.
PG  - e0126704
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126704 [doi]
LID - e0126704
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metformin is the first-line oral hypoglycemic agent for type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus recommended by international guidelines. However, little information exists 
      comparing it with acarbose which is also commonly used in China. This study expanded 
      knowledge by combining direct and indirect evidence to ascertain the glucose 
      lowering effects of both drugs. METHODS: PubMed (1980- December 2013) and China 
      National Knowledge Infrastructure databases (1994-January 2014) were systematically 
      searched for eligible randomized controlled trials from Chinese and English 
      literatures. Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the glucose lowering effects of 
      metformin vs. acarbose, or either of them vs. common comparators (placebo or 
      sulphonylureas), using random- and fixed-effect models. Bucher method with indirect 
      treatment comparison calculator was applied to convert the summary estimates from 
      the meta-analyses into weighted-mean-difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) to represent the comparative efficacy between metformin and acarbose. RESULTS: 
      A total of 75 studies were included in the analysis. In direct comparison (8 
      trials), metformin reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.06% more than 
      acarbose, with no significant difference (WMD,-0.06%; 95% CI, -0.32% to 0.20%). In 
      indirect comparisons (67 trials), by using placebo and sulphonylureas as common 
      comparators, metformin achieved significant HbA1c reduction than acarbose, by -0.38% 
      (WMD,-0.38%, 95% CI, -0.736% to -0.024%) and -0.34% (WMD, -0.34%, 95% CI, -0.651% to 
      -0.029%) respectively. CONCLUSION: The glucose lowering effects of metformin 
      monotherapy and acarbose monotherapy are the same by direct comparison, while 
      metformin is a little better by indirect comparison. This implies that the effect of 
      metformin is at least as good as acarbose's.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis (MA) offers advantages 
      over aggregate MA of using standardised criteria for patient characteristics across 
      trials, and allowing reliable investigation of subgroup effects of interventions. 
      Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows for the comparison of multiple treatments in a 
      comprehensive analysis and the determination of the best treatment among several 
      competing treatments, including those that have never been compared in a 
      head-to-head study. Including IPD in NMA may enable the prevention of misleading 
      inferences due to several biases, such as aggregation bias. Application of IPD-NMA 
      methods in healthcare have begun to appear in medical journals. Our objective is to 
      conduct a scoping review of existing IPD-NMA methods, and summarise their 
      properties. We also aim to describe the characteristics of empirical IPD-NMAs, and 
      examine how their results are reported. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search 
      relevant electronic databases from inception until October 2014 (eg, MEDLINE), grey 
      literature, and Google. The scoping review will consider published and unpublished 
      papers that report completion of an IPD-NMA, describe a method, or report the 
      methodological quality of IPD-NMA. We will include IPD-NMA of any quantitative study 
      (eg, experimental, quasiexperimental, observational studies). Two reviewers will 
      independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles, and will complete 
      data abstraction. The anticipated outcome will be a collection of all the IPD-NMAs 
      completed to date, and a description of their methods and reporting of results. We 
      will create summary tables providing the characteristics of the included studies, 
      and the various methods. Quantitative data (eg, number of patients) will be 
      summarised by medians and IQRs, and categorical data (eg, type of effect size) by 
      frequencies and percentages. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not 
      required as our study will not include confidential participant data and 
      interventions. We will disseminate our results through an open access, peer-reviewed 
      publication.

AB  - Availability of individual patient-level data (IPD) broadens the scope of network 
      meta-analysis (NMA) and enables us to incorporate patient-level information. 
      Although IPD is a potential gold mine in biomedical areas, methodological 
      development has been slow owing to limited access to such data. In this paper, we 
      propose a Bayesian IPD NMA modeling framework for multiple continuous outcomes under 
      both contrast-based and arm-based parameterizations. We incorporate individual 
      covariate-by-treatment interactions to facilitate personalized decision making. 
      Furthermore, we can find subpopulations performing well with a certain drug in terms 
      of predictive outcomes. We also impute missing individual covariates via an MCMC 
      algorithm. We illustrate this approach using diabetes data that include continuous 
      bivariate efficacy outcomes and three baseline covariates and show its practical

      computational challenges, and a brief description of areas for future research.

TI  - Dabrafenib for Treating Unresectable, Advanced or Metastatic BRAF V600 
      Mutation-Positive Melanoma: An Evidence Review Group Perspective.
PG  - 893-904
LID - 10.1007/s40273-015-0276-9 [doi]
AB  - The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited 
      GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of dabrafenib, to submit evidence for the clinical 
      and cost effectiveness of dabrafenib for the treatment of unresectable, advanced or 
      metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma in accordance with the Institute's 
      Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation 
      Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence 
      Review Group (ERG). This article summarizes the ERG's review of the evidence 
      submitted by the company and provides a summary of the Appraisal Committee's (AC) 
      final decision in October 2014. The clinical evidence for dabrafenib was derived 
      from an ongoing phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      international, multicentre clinical trial (BREAK-3) involving 230 patients 
      randomized 2:1 to receive either dabrafenib or dacarbazine. A significant 
      improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS) 
      was reported in the dabrafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. Vemurafenib is 
      considered a more appropriate comparator than is dacarbazine. The clinical evidence 
      for vemurafenib was derived from a completed phase III, randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BRIM-3) involving 675 
      patients randomized 1:1 to receive either vemurafenib or dacarbazine. A significant 
      improvement in median PFS and OS was reported in the vemurafenib arm compared with 
      dacarbazine. As there is no direct evidence comparing dabrafenib versus vemurafenib, 
      the company presented an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) that demonstrated no 
      statistical differences between dabrafenib and vemurafenib for PFS or OS. The ERG 
      expressed concerns with the ITC, mainly in relation to the validity of the 
      assumptions underpinning the methodology; the ERG concluded this resulted in 
      findings that are unlikely to be robust or reliable. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are 
      both available to patients treated by the National Health Service (NHS) in England 
      via a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) in which the costs of the drugs are discounted. 
      Using these discounted costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
      generated by the company were £60,980 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for 
      dabrafenib versus dacarbazine and £11,046 per QALY gained for dabrafenib versus 
      vemurafenib. The ERG considered the economic model structure developed by the 
      company to derive the ICERs to be overly complex and based on unsubstantiated 
      assumptions, most importantly in relation to the projection of OS. Applying the 
      latest OS data from BREAK-3 to a less complex model structure increased the 
      estimated ICER for dabrafenib compared with dacarbazine from £60,980 to £112,727 per 
      QALY gained. Since the results from the ITC were considered by the ERG to be neither 
      reliable nor robust, the ERG also considered a cost-effectiveness comparison to be 
      inappropriate due to a lack of meaningful or reliable data. In spite of limitations 
      in the data, the AC took the view that dabrafenib and vemurafenib were "likely" of 
      similar clinical effectiveness. Since the overall costs of these two drugs were 
      similar, the AC recommended the use of dabrafenib in patients with unresectable, 
      advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.

TI  - Network meta-analysis combining individual patient and aggregate data from a mixture 
      of study designs with an application to pulmonary arterial hypertension.
PG  - 34

AB  - BACKGROUND: Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a methodology for indirectly comparing, 
      and strengthening direct comparisons of two or more treatments for the management of 
      disease by combining evidence from multiple studies. It is sometimes not possible to 
      perform treatment comparisons as evidence networks restricted to randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) may be disconnected. We propose a Bayesian NMA model that 
      allows to include single-arm, before-and-after, observational studies to complete 
      these disconnected networks. We illustrate the method with an indirect comparison of 
      treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). METHODS: Our method uses a 
      random effects model for placebo improvements to include single-arm observational 
      studies into a general NMA. Building on recent research for binary outcomes, we 
      develop a covariate-adjusted continuous-outcome NMA model that combines individual 
      patient data (IPD) and aggregate data from two-arm RCTs with the single-arm 
      observational studies. We apply this model to a complex comparison of therapies for 
      PAH combining IPD from a phase-III RCT of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH and 
      aggregate data from RCTs and single-arm observational studies, both identified by a 
      systematic review. RESULTS: Through the inclusion of observational studies, our 
      method allowed the comparison of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH with other 
      treatments. This comparison had not been previously possible due to the limited RCT 
      evidence available. However, the credible intervals of our posterior estimates were 
      wide so the overall results were inconclusive. The comparison should be treated as 
      exploratory and should not be used to guide clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      method for the inclusion of single-arm observational studies allows the performance 
      of indirect comparisons that had previously not been possible due to incomplete 
      networks composed solely of available RCTs. We also built on many recent innovations 
      to enable researchers to use both aggregate data and IPD. This method could be used 
      in similar situations where treatment comparisons have not been possible due to 
      restrictions to RCT evidence and where a mixture of aggregate data and IPD are 
      available.

LID - 10.7399/fh.2015.39.2.8218 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative efficacy of infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab 
      through adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs). METHODS: An exhaustive 
      search was performed until October 2013. Databases consulted were MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      the Cochrane Library, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Web of 
      Science. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of infliximab, 
      adalimumab or golimumab versus placebo, in terms of clinical remission, clinical 
      response and mucosal healing, were included. In the case that more than one RCT 
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the same drug, a metanalysis was undertaken 
      using a fixed effects model. ITCs were carried out using the method proposed by 
      Bucher et al. RESULTS: 6 RCTs published in 5 papers were included: 2 for infliximab 
      (ACT 1 and ACT 2), 2 for adalimumab (ULTRA 1 y ULTRA 2) and 2 for golimumab 
      (PURSUIT-SC y PURSUIT-M).In these RTCs, each biological agent was superior in 
      efficacy to placebo. The results of the adjusted ITC are the following. In relation 
      to the clinical remission, in the induction and maintenance period, there are no 
      statistically significant differences between the three anti-TNF drugs. In relation 
      to the clinical response and mucosal healing, in the induction period, there are 
      statistically significant differences between infliximab and adalimumab. CONCLUSION: 
      In view of the results obtained, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab appear to be 
      similarly effective therapeutic alternatives. Therefore, other considerations such 
      as safety, tolerance and cost-effectiveness should be taken into account in order to 
      select the most appropriate treatment.

PG  - 537-49
LID - 10.1007/s40273-015-0271-1 [doi]
AB  - Estimates of the relative effects of competing treatments are rarely available from 
      head-to-head trials. These effects must therefore be derived from indirect 
      comparisons of results from different studies. The feasibility of comparisons relies 
      on the network linking treatments through common comparators; the reliability of 
      these may also be impacted when the studies are heterogeneous or when multiple 
      intermediate comparisons are needed to link two specific treatments of interest. 
      Simulated treatment comparison and matching-adjusted indirect comparison have been 
      developed to address these challenges. These focus on comparisons of outcomes for 
      two specific treatments of interest by using patient-level data for one treatment 
      (the index) and published results for the other treatment (the comparator) from 
      compatible studies, taking into account possible confounding due to population 
      differences. This paper provides an overview of how and when these approaches can be 
      used as an alternative or to complement standard MTC approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To critically appraise published network meta-analyses (NMAs) evaluating 
      the efficacy or safety of the new oral anticogulants (NOACs) dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, and apixaban for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to 
      identify the relevant NMAs using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Database of 
      Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Health Technology Assessment. The synthesis 
      studies were evaluated using the "Questionnaire to assess the relevance and 
      credibility of the NMA." RESULTS: Eleven NMAs evaluating NOACs among adults with 
      nonvalvular AF were identified. Most NMAs included three large phase III randomized 
      controlled trials, comparing NOACs to adjusted-dose warfarin (Randomized Evaluation 
      of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy [RE-LY], Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct 
      Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and 
      Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation [ROCKET-AF], and Apixaban for Reduction of 
      Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE]). The main 
      differences identified related to potential treatment effect modifiers regarding the 
      mean time spent in therapeutic range (TTR) in the warfarin arm, the risk of stroke 
      or systemic embolism across the trials (mean CHADS2 score: C = congestive heart 
      failure, H = hypertension, A = older than age 75 years, D = diabetes mellitus, S2 = 
      prior stroke or history of transient ischemic attack) or primary versus secondary 
      prevention, and type of populations used in the analysis. Kansal et al. [Kansal AR, 
      Sharma M, Bradley-Kennedy C, et al. Dabigatran versus rivaroxaban for the prevention 
      of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation in Canada: comparative 
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Thromb Haemost 2012;108:672-82] appropriately 
      adjusted the ROCKET-AF TTR to match the RE-LY population on the basis of individual 
      patient data. Meta-regressions are not expected to minimize confounding bias given 
      limited data, whereas subgroup analyses had some impact on the point estimates for 
      the treatment comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the synthesis studies were 
      generally comparable and suggested that the NOACs had similar efficacy, although 
      some differences were identified depending on the outcome. The extent to which 
      differences in the distribution of TTR, CHADS2 score, or primary versus secondary 
      prevention biased the results remains unclear.

TI  - Efficacy comparison of duloxetine and SSRIs at doses approved in Japan.
PG  - 115-23
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S72642 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approved doses of antidepressants in Japan are usually lower than those 
      in the USA and European Union, but to date meta-analyses comparing antidepressants 
      have all used the higher doses approved in the USA and European Union and often have 
      used indirect comparisons. The purpose of this study was to conduct an integrated 
      database analysis of patient level data to compare the effects of duloxetine with 
      those of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at the doses approved in 
      Japan. METHODS: Pooled data were analyzed from four randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled studies that compared duloxetine at the dose range approved in 
      Japan (40-60 mg/day) with other SSRIs (paroxetine 20 mg/day or escitalopram 10 
      mg/day) and placebo in patients with major depressive disorder. In total, 1,694 
      patients were included in the analysis (duloxetine, n=688; selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors, n=690; placebo, n=316). The primary outcome measure was the 
      mean change from baseline at week 8 in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 
      (HAMD17) total and subscale scores. RESULTS: Duloxetine and both selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors were superior to placebo in HAMD17 total score at week 8 in both 
      the all-randomized group and the more severe subgroup (HAMD17 total scores ≥19). 
      Duloxetine was superior to SSRIs in improving the HAMD17 Retardation subscale score 
      (least squares mean difference [95% confidence interval]): all-randomized group, 
      -0.33 [-0.60, -0.07], P=0.015; severe subgroup, -0.45 [-0.83, -0.07], P=0.020). 
      CONCLUSION: Within the dose range approved in Japan for patients with major 
      depressive disorder, duloxetine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      demonstrated comparable overall efficacy, with a possible advantage for duloxetine 
      in improving loss of energy and interest. To the best of our knowledge, this 
      analysis is unique not only in evaluating dosages specific to Japan, but also in 
      using individual patient data and the same endpoint across studies to allow for 
      strictly direct head-to-head data comparisons as opposed to pooling direct and 
      indirect comparisons.

AB  - Clinical decision-making requires synthesis of an often complex evidence base. Novel 
      tools have been developed building upon the historical approach of reviewing the 
      literature focusing on a specific topic. Stemming from qualitative reviews, 
      systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials, typically encompassing statistical 
      pooling with pairwise meta-analysis, have been devised and are now considered one of 
      the uppermost ladders in the hierarchy of clinical evidence. In the last decade, the 
      exponential growth in randomized trials and the introduction of original 
      computational methods have created the novel opportunity to compare indirectly 
      competing treatments, as well as combining effect estimates stemming from 
      head-to-head trials with those obtained by indirect comparisons. These methods 
      include adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, and mixed 
      treatment comparison. While still the focus of intense research and debate, they 
      represent a powerful tool for evidence synthesis and comparative effectiveness in 
      cardiovascular research, and thus are likely to become increasingly popular and 
      impactful in shaping research agenda and clinical practice. This is clearly 
      highlighted by a number of recent landmark network meta-analyses on smoking 
      cessation therapies, coronary stents, and management of patent foramen ovale in 
      patients with history of cryptogenic stroke.

TI  - Incorporating alternative design clinical trials in network meta-analyses.
PG  - 29-35
LID - 10.2147/CLEP.S70853 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Network meta-analysis (NMA) is an extension of conventional pairwise 
      meta-analysis that allows for simultaneous comparison of multiple interventions. 
      Well-established drug class efficacies have become commonplace in many disease 
      areas. Thus, for reasons of ethics and equipoise, it is not practical to randomize 
      patients to placebo or older drug classes. Unique randomized clinical trial designs 
      are an attempt to navigate these obstacles. These alternative designs, however, pose 
      challenges when attempting to incorporate data into NMAs. Using ulcerative colitis 
      as an example, we illustrate an example of a method where data provided by these 
      trials are used to populate treatment networks. METHODS: We present the methods used 
      to convert data from the PURSUIT trial into a typical parallel design for inclusion 
      in our NMA. Data were required for three arms: golimumab 100 mg; golimumab 50 mg; 
      and placebo. Golimumab 100 mg induction data were available; however, data regarding 
      those individuals who were nonresponders at induction and those who were responders 
      at maintenance were not reported, and as such, had to be imputed using data from the 
      rerandomization phase. Golimumab 50 mg data regarding responses at week 6 were not 
      available. Existing relationships between the available components were used to 
      impute the expected proportions in this missing subpopulation. Data for placebo 
      maintenance response were incomplete, as all induction nonresponders were assigned 
      to golimumab 100 mg. Data from the PURSUIT trial were combined with ACT-1 and 
      ULTRA-2 trial data to impute missing information. DISCUSSION: We have demonstrated 
      methods for converting results from alternative study designs to more conventional 
      parallel randomized clinical trials. These conversions allow for indirect treatment 
      comparisons that are informed by a wider array of evidence, adding to the precision 
      of estimates.

TI  - Relative efficacy and safety of simeprevir and telaprevir in treatment-naïve 
      hepatitis C-infected patients in a Japanese population: A Bayesian network 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - E89-98
LID - 10.1111/hepr.12467 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Simeprevir (SMV) is an oral, once-daily protease inhibitor for the treatment of 
      chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection. In phase II/III randomized 
      controlled trials (RCT) conducted in Japan, SMV, in combination with peginterferon-α 
      and ribavirin (PEG IFN/RBV), demonstrated potent efficacy in HCV genotype 1-infected 
      patients relative to PEG IFN/RBV and was generally well tolerated. Telaprevir (TVR) 
      in combination with PEG IFN/RBV is licensed for the treatment of HCV in Japan. In 
      the absence of head-to-head comparisons of TVR and SMV in a Japanese population, we 
      undertook a network meta-analysis (NMA) to examine the relative efficacy and safety 
      of SMV and TVR in combination with PEG IFN/RBV. METHODS: A systematic review 
      identified SMV and TVR RCT in Japanese treatment-naïve patients. Bayesian NMA was 
      performed assuming fixed study effects. RESULTS: Three studies met our inclusion 
      criteria: two SMV and one TVR. SMV showed a higher mean odds ratio (OR) of achieving 
      SVR versus TVR (OR, 1.68 (95% credible interval 0.66-4.26)). SMV showed a lower mean 
      OR of discontinuation: overall, 0.35 (0.12-1.00); and due to AE, 0.87 (0.23-3.34) 
      versus TVR. SMV showed a lower mean OR of experiencing anemia 0.20 (0.07-0.56) and 
      rash 0.41 (0.17-0.99) but a higher mean OR of experiencing pruritus 1.26 (0.46-3.47) 
      versus TVR. CONCLUSION: In this indirect treatment comparison, SMV, in combination 
      with PEG IFN/RBV, showed a favorable risk-benefit profile compared with TVR with PEG 
      IFN/RBV in Japanese treatment-naïve HCV patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following drug-eluting 
      stents (DES) remains controversial and is a topic of ongoing research. METHODS: 
      Direct and adjusted indirect comparisons of all the recent randomized control trials 
      (RCTs) were performed to evaluate the safety of short-term versus long-term DAPT 
      following DES. RESULTS: 8 RCTs were identified and 7 (16,318 subjects) were 
      included. 4 groups of 3 vs 12 months, 6 vs 12 months, 6 vs 24 months and 12 vs 24 
      months of DAPT were used for direct comparison. There was no significant difference 
      in stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and revascularization, 
      cardiovascular and all-cause mortality between the different durations in all 4 
      groups. Pooling trials of 3-6 months of DAPT against 12 months, we found a 
      significant reduction in the risk of total bleeding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.87). 
      Adjusted indirect comparison between 3 vs 6 months, 3 vs 24 months and 6 vs 24 month 
      duration of DAPT showed no significant differences in risk of death or MI, or 
      revascularization between 3 or 6 months and 24 months. However, 24months of DAPT was 
      associated with significantly more bleeding than 3 or 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: 3 to 6 
      months of DAPT following second generation DES and above is safe with no increased 
      risk of thrombotic complications and mortality, and lower bleeding risk. However a 
      tailored approach may be more appropriate for high-risk patients.

TI  - Failure Rate of Direct High-Viscosity Glass-Ionomer Versus Hybrid Resin Composite 
      Restorations in Posterior Permanent Teeth - a Systematic Review.
PG  - 438-48
LID - 10.2174/1874210601509010438 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Traditionally, resin composite restorations are claimed by reviews of the 
      dental literature as being superior to glass-ionomer fillings in terms of 
      restoration failures in posterior permanent teeth. The aim of this systematic review 
      is to answer the clinical question, whether conventional high-viscosity 
      glass-ionomer restorations, in patients with single and/or multi-surface cavities in 
      posterior permanent teeth, have indeed a higher failure rate than direct hybrid 
      resin composite restorations. METHODS: Eight databases were searched until December 
      02, 2013. Trials were assessed for bias risks, in-between datasets heterogeneity and 
      statistical sample size power. Effects sizes were computed and statistically 
      compared. A total of 55 citations were identified through systematic literature 
      search. From these, 46 were excluded. No trials related to high-viscosity 
      glass-ionomers versus resin composite restorations for direct head-to-head 
      comparison were found. Three trials related to high-viscosity glass-ionomers versus 
      amalgam and three trials related to resin composite versus amalgam restorations 
      could be included for adjusted indirect comparison, only. RESULTS: The available 
      evidence suggests no difference in the failure rates between both types of 
      restoration beyond the play of chance, is limited by lack of head-to-head 
      comparisons and an insufficient number of trials, as well as by high bias and 
      in-between-dataset heterogeneity risk. The current clinical evidence needs to be 
      regarded as too poor in order to justify superiority claims regarding the failure 
      rates of both restoration types. Sufficiently large-sized, parallel-group, 
      randomised control trials with high internal validity are needed, in order to 
      justify any clinically meaningful judgment to this topic.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of different anticoagulants on patients with severe sepsis 
      and derangement of coagulation: a protocol for network meta-analysis of randomised 
      controlled trials.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in non-cardiological 
      critically ill patients. There are as many as 20 million cases of sepsis annually 
      worldwide, with a mortality rate of around 35%. It has been reported that the 
      dysregulation of haemostatic system due to the interaction between coagulation 
      system and inflammatory response is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with 
      severe sepsis. In this context, several anticoagulants have been evaluated in recent 
      years. However, the results of these studies were inconsistent and even 
      contradictory. In addition, there is insufficient evidence comparing the efficacy 
      and safety of different anticoagulants. The purpose of our study is to carry out a 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of 
      different anticoagulants for severe sepsis based on existing randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) and ranking these anticoagulants for practical consideration. METHODS 
      AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases will be systematically 
      searched for eligible studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) on anticoagulant 
      therapy for severe sepsis with multiple outcome measures will be included. The 
      Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool will be used to assess the quality of included studies. 
      The primary outcomes are mortality and bleeding events. The secondary outcomes 
      include the length of intensive care stay, the length of hospital stay and duration 
      of mechanical ventilation. Direct pairwise meta-analysis (DMA), indirect treatment 
      comparison meta-analysis (ITC) and network meta-analysis (NMA) will be conducted to 
      compare different anticoagulants. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not 
      required given that this is a protocol for a systematic review. The protocol of this 
      systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at a 
      relevant conference. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This protocol has been registered in 
      PROSPERO (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/) under registration number 
      CRD42014013886.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to create a new meta-analysis method for 
      cost-effectiveness studies using comparative efficiency research (COMER). METHODS: 
      We built a new score named total incremental net benefit (TINB), with inverse 
      variance weighting of incremental net benefits (INB). This permits determination of 
      whether an alternative is cost-effective, given a specific threshold (TINB > 0 
      test). Before validation of the model, the structure of dependence between costs and 
      quality-adjusted life years (QoL) was analysed using copula distributions. The 
      goodness-of-fit of a Spanish prospective observational study (n = 498) was analysed 
      using the Independent, Gaussian, T, Gumbel, Clayton, Frank and Placket copulas. 
      Validation was carried out by simulating a copula distribution with log-normal 
      distribution for costs and gamma distribution for disutilities. Hypothetical cohorts 
      were created by varying the sample size (n: 15-500) and assuming three scenarios 
      (1-cost-effective; 2-non-cost-effective; 3-dominant). The COMER result was compared 
      to the theoretical result according to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
      (ICER) and the INB, assuming a margin of error of 2,000 and 500 monetary units, 
      respectively. RESULTS: The Frank copula with positive dependence (-0.4279) showed a 
      goodness-of-fit sufficient to represent costs and QoL (p-values 0.524 and 0.808). 
      The theoretical INB was within the 95% confidence interval of the TINB, based on 15 
      individuals with a probability > 80% for scenarios 1 and 2, and > 90% for scenario 
      3. The TINB > 0 test with 15 individuals showed p-values of 0.0105 (SD: 0.0411) for 
      scenario 1, 0.613 (SD: 0.265) for scenario 2 and < 0.0001 for scenario 3. 
      CONCLUSIONS: COMER is a valid tool for combining cost-effectiveness studies and may 
      be of use to health decision makers.

TI  - Overview review: Comparative efficacy of oral ibuprofen and paracetamol 
      (acetaminophen) across acute and chronic pain conditions.
PG  - 1213-23
LID - 10.1002/ejp.649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibuprofen and paracetamol have long been used as analgesics in a range 
      of acute, intermittent and chronic pain conditions. Paracetamol is often the first 
      line analgesic recommended, without consensus about which is the better analgesic. 
      METHODS: An overview review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses directly 
      compares ibuprofen and paracetamol at standard doses in particular painful 
      conditions, or uses indirect comparisons against placebo. Electronic searches for 
      systematic reviews were sought published since 1995 using outcomes approximating to 
      ≥50% pain intensity reduction. Painful conditions were acute post-operative pain, 
      dysmenorrhoea, tension-type headache (TTH), migraine, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
      arthritis, back pain, cancer and paediatric pain. There was no systematic assessment 
      of harm. RESULTS: Sixteen systematic reviews and four individual patient data 
      meta-analyses were included. Ibuprofen was consistently superior to paracetamol at 
      conventional doses in a range of painful conditions. Two direct comparisons favoured 
      ibuprofen (acute pain, osteoarthritis). Three of four indirect comparisons favoured 
      ibuprofen (acute pain, migraine, osteoarthritis); one showed no difference (TTH), 
      although there were methodological problems. In five pain conditions (dysmenorrhoea, 
      paediatric pain, cancer pain, back pain and rheumatoid arthritis), there were 
      limited data on paracetamol and ibuprofen. CONCLUSIONS: At standard doses in 
      different painful conditions, ibuprofen was usually superior producing more patients 
      with the degree of pain relief that patients feel worthwhile. Neither of the drugs 
      will be effective for everyone, and both are needed. This overview questions the 
      practice of routinely using paracetamol as a first line analgesic because there is 
      no good evidence for efficacy of paracetamol in many pain conditions.

AB  - Several phase I/II studies of chemoradiotherapy for gastric cancer have reported 
      promising results, but the significance of preoperative radiotherapy in addition to 
      chemotherapy has not been proven. In this study, a systematic literature search was 
      performed to capture survival and postoperative morbidity and mortality data in 
      randomised clinical studies comparing preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy or 
      chemotherapy versus surgery alone, or preoperative chemoradiotherapy versus 
      chemotherapy for gastric and/or gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) cancer. Hazard 
      ratios (HRs) for overall mortality were extracted from the original studies, 
      individual patient data provided from the principal investigators of eligible 
      studies or the earlier published meta-analysis. The incidences of postoperative 
      morbidities and mortalities were also analysed. In total 18 studies were eligible 
      and data were available from 14 of these. The meta-analysis on overall survival 
      yielded HRs of 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.86, P < 0.001) for preoperative 
      (chemo)radiotherapy and 0.83 (95% CI 0.67-1.01, P = 0.065) for preoperative 
      chemotherapy when compared to surgery alone. Direct comparison between preoperative 
      chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy resulted in an HR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.45-1.12, P = 
      0.146). Combination of direct and adjusted indirect comparisons yielded an HR of 
      0.86 (95% CI 0.69-1.07, P = 0.171). No statistically significant differences were 
      seen in the risk for postoperative morbidity or mortality between preoperative 
      treatments and surgery alone, or preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and chemotherapy. 
      Preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy for gastric and GOJ cancer showed significant 
      survival benefit over surgery alone. In comparisons between preoperative 
      chemotherapy and (chemo)radiotherapy, there is a trend towards improved survival 
      when adding radiotherapy, without increased postoperative morbidity or mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In comparative systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy, 
      inconsistencies between direct and indirect comparisons may lead to bias. We 
      investigated whether using individual patient data (IPD) can adjust for this form of 
      bias. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We included IPD of 3 ovarian reserve tests from 32 
      studies. Inconsistency was defined as a statistically significant difference in 
      relative accuracy or different comparative results between the direct and indirect 
      evidence. We adjusted for the effect of threshold and reference standard, as well as 
      for patient-specific variables. RESULTS: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle 
      stimulation hormone (FSH) differed significantly in sensitivity (-0.1563, P = 0.04). 
      AMH and antral follicle count (AFC) differed significantly in sensitivity (0.1465, P 
      < 0.01). AMH and AFC differed significantly in specificity (-0.0607, P = 0.02). The 
      area under the curve (AUC) differed significantly between AFC and FSH (0.0948, P < 
      0.01) in the direct comparison but not (0.0678, P = 0.09) in the indirect 
      comparison. The AUCs of AFC and AMH differed significantly (-0.0830, P < 0.01) in 
      the indirect comparison but not (-0.0176, P = 0.29) in the direct comparison. These 
      differences remained after adjusting for indirectness. CONCLUSION: Estimates of 
      comparative accuracy obtained through indirect comparisons are not always consistent 
      with those obtained through direct comparisons. Using IPD to adjust for indirectness 
      did not successfully remove the bias in this case study.

AB  - This systematic literature review with meta-analysis was conducted on the clinical 
      efficacy and safety of interventions used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia (CLL). We systematically searched databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and 
      Embase; 1997 to August 2, 2012), conference abstracts, bibliographic reference 
      lists, recent reviews, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Primary efficacy outcomes were 
      objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Safety end 
      points were Grade 3/4 toxicities, serious adverse events, withdrawals because of 
      toxicity, and deaths due to toxicity. Studies were selected if they were randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of relapsed or 
      refractory CLL and if outcomes for CLL were reported separately from trials that 
      included other lymphoid neoplasms. We used the Bucher method for conducting adjusted 
      indirect comparisons within a meta-analysis. We identified 6 RCTs of pharmacologic 
      treatment for relapsed/refractory CLL. The most common drugs investigated (alone or 
      in combination) were fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. When reported, median overall 
      survival ranged from 27.3 to 52.9 months, and overall response rate from 58% to 82%. 
      Although meta-analysis of efficacy results was considered, details are not presented 
      because only 3 studies qualified and the common comparator treatment was not 
      clinically relevant. The relatively small number of RCTs, few overlapping treatment 
      arms, and variability in end points studied make it difficult to formally compare 
      therapies for relapsed/refractory CLL. Significant variability in RCT features 
      presents a further challenge to meaningful comparisons. Additional well-designed 
      RCTs are needed to fully understand the relative efficacy and safety of older and 
      more recently developed therapies.

TI  - Comparison of the cost-effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants for the prevention 
      of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation in a UK setting.

AB  - PURPOSE: Three new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have recently become available in the 
      United Kingdom as an alternative to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and 
      systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation. This study examines the relative 
      cost-effectiveness of dabigatran (BID dosing of 150 mg or 110 mg based on patient 
      age), rivaroxaban, and apixaban from a UK payer perspective. METHODS: A previously 
      published model that follows up patients through treatment of atrial fibrillation 
      during a lifetime was adapted to allow comparison of the 3 NOACs and warfarin. Acute 
      thromboembolic and bleeding events, as well as long-term consequences of stroke, 
      intracranial hemorrhage, and acute myocardial infarction, were tracked. Relative 
      efficacy was calculated from a formal indirect treatment comparison using data from 
      the 3 key trials (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy, 
      Rivaroxaban Once-daily oral direct factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K 
      antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation, and 
      Apixaban for the Prevention of Stroke in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation) of the 
      NOACs. Data from the rivaroxaban trial were adjusted for the difference in 
      international normalized ratio control among warfarin patients versus the other 2 
      trials. Model outputs included total costs, event rates, and quality-adjusted 
      life-years. FINDINGS: Among the patients taking NOACs, those taking dabigatran had 
      the highest total QALYs (7.68 QALYs), followed by apixaban (7.63 QALYs) and 
      rivaroxaban (7.47 QALYs). Patients taking dabigatran had the lowest total lifetime 
      costs (£23,342), followed by apixaban (£24,014) and rivaroxaban (£25,220). The 
      differences between dabigatran and apixaban were modest but consistent in 
      sensitivity analyses, with the directionality only changing at the limits of the CIs 
      for the relative risks of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage or when 
      assuming that both treatment discontinuation and post-event disability rates differ 
      by drug. IMPLICATIONS: Dabigatran was found to be economically dominant over 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban in the UK setting. These economic findings are based on 
      relative clinical efficacy from an indirect treatment comparison and would benefit 
      from any data of direct comparisons of the NOACs in the future.

TI  - No evidence of disease activity: indirect comparisons of oral therapies for the 
      treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 1134-54
LID - 10.1007/s12325-014-0167-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: No head-to-head trials have compared the efficacy of the oral 
      therapies, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide, in multiple sclerosis. 
      Statistical modeling approaches, which control for differences in patient 
      characteristics, can improve indirect comparisons of the efficacy of these 
      therapies. METHODS: No evidence of disease activity (NEDA) was evaluated as the 
      proportion of patients free from relapses and 3-month confirmed disability 
      progression (clinical composite), free from gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions and new 
      or newly enlarged T2 lesions (magnetic resonance imaging composite), or free from 
      all disease measures (overall composite). For each measure, the efficacy of 
      fingolimod was estimated by analyzing individual patient data from fingolimod phase 
      3 trials using methodologies from studies of other oral therapies. These data were 
      then used to build binomial regression models, which adjusted for differences in 
      baseline characteristics between the studies. Models predicted the indirect relative 
      risk of achieving NEDA status for fingolimod versus dimethyl fumarate or 
      teriflunomide in an average patient from their respective phase 3 trials. RESULTS: 
      The estimated relative risks of achieving NEDA status for fingolimod versus placebo 
      in a pooled fingolimod trial population were numerically greater (i.e., fingolimod 
      more efficacious) than the estimated relative risks for dimethyl fumarate or 
      teriflunomide versus placebo in each respective trial population. In indirect 
      comparisons, the predicted relative risks for all composite measures were better for 
      fingolimod than comparator when tested against the trial populations of those 
      treated with dimethyl fumarate (relative risk, clinical: 1.21 [95% confidence 
      interval 1.06-1.39]; overall: 1.67 [1.08-2.57]), teriflunomide 7 mg (clinical: 1.22 
      [1.02-1.46]; overall: 2.01 [1.38-2.93]) and teriflunomide 14 mg (clinical: 1.14 
      [0.96-1.36]; overall: 1.61 [1.12-2.31]). CONCLUSION: Our modeling approach suggests 
      that fingolimod therapy results in a higher probability of NEDA than dimethyl 
      fumarate and teriflunomide therapy when phase 3 trial data are indirectly compared 
      and differences between trials are adjusted for.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of group-based mindfulness-based stress reduction and 
      cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment and management of chronic pain 
      disorders: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis with indirect 
      comparisons.
PG  - 134
LID - 10.1186/2046-4053-3-134 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain disorders impact the physical, psychological, social, and 
      financial well-being of between 10%-30% of Canadians. The primary aims of 
      psychological interventions targeting chronic pain disorders are to reduce patients' 
      pain-related disability and to improve their quality of life. Cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) is the prevailing treatment for chronic pain, however 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has displayed promise as an alternative 
      treatment option. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to 
      compare MBSR to CBT in their relative ability to reduce pain-related disability and 
      intensity, to alleviate emotional distress, and to improve global functioning in 
      chronic pain patients. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review with 
      meta-analyses to compare MBSR to CBT in the treatment of chronic pain disorders in 
      adults. We will report our review according to the recommendations provided by the 
      PRISMA statement. Randomized studies will be included and the literature search will 
      comprise Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 
      Embase Classic+Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library on Wiley, including CENTRAL, 
      Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, and HTA. Study selection and data 
      extraction will be conducted by independent investigators and in duplicate. Outcomes 
      of interest will include pain interference, pain intensity, emotional functioning, 
      and patient global impression of change. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used 
      to assess risk of bias of included studies. As we anticipate that scales used to 
      measure participant responses will be related but varied from study to study, 
      standardized mean differences will be used to compare effect sizes between treatment 
      modalities. Given the possibility of little or no head-to-head evidence comparing 
      MBSR with CBT, we will use indirect treatment comparison methodology to assess the 
      relative effectiveness of these interventions. DISCUSSION: The findings from this 
      study will assist patients and treatment providers to make informed decisions 
      regarding evidence-based treatment selection for chronic pain disorders. SYSTEMATIC

AB  - EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES As a result of reading this article, physicians should be 
      able to: 1. Recognize the high risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 
      patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. 2. Distinguish the different 
      pharmacological mechanisms of VTE prophylaxis drugs. 3. Delineate the advantages and 
      disadvantages of each VTE prophylaxis drug. 4. Recognize that rivaroxaban is as 
      efficacious as apixaban but can increase the risk of hemorrhage. Patients undergoing 
      major orthopedic surgery are at high risk for developing postoperative venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE). The authors analyzed the available evidence on the efficacy 
      and safety of dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban vs low-molecular-weight heparins 
      (LMWHs) as VTE prophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery. Outcomes evaluated included 
      total VTE, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), death, and major 
      bleeding. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are more efficacious than dabigatran and are as 
      safe as dabigatran. Rivaroxaban is as efficacious as apixaban but can increase the 
      risk of hemorrhage.

TI  - One-year and long-term molecular response to nilotinib and dasatinib for newly 
      diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia: a matching-adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 315-22
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2014.977992 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nilotinib and dasatinib have shown superior rates of molecular response 
      (MR) compared to imatinib for the treatment of newly diagnosed chronic myeloid 
      leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP). This study indirectly compares MR in patients 
      taking nilotinib 300 mg bid with that in those taking dasatinib 100 mg qd by 12 
      months and through 48 months. METHODS: Patients in ENESTnd were re-weighted to match 
      published baseline characteristics reported for DASISION using a propensity score 
      model. After matching, differences in rates of major MR (MMR, measured as a 3 log 
      reduction on the International Scale [IS]), MR(4.0) (4 log reduction on IS), and 
      MR(4.5) (4.5 log reduction on IS) relative to imatinib were indirectly compared 
      between nilotinib and dasatinib. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to indirectly compare 
      MR outcomes between nilotinib and dasatinib through 48 months of follow-up, while 
      rate differences were used to compare progression to AP/BC between nilotinib and 
      dasatinib by 48 months. RESULTS: After matching, rates of MR by 12 months were 
      higher with nilotinib vs dasatinib by 11.7% for MMR (p = 0.045), 8.2% for MR(4.0) 
      (p = 0.029), and 8.5% for MR(4.5) (p < 0.001). Higher rates of MMR (HR = 1.44, 
      p = 0.018) and MR(4.0) (HR = 1.58, p = 0.013) achievement were maintained with 
      nilotinib compared to dasatinib through 48 months of follow-up. No statistically 
      significant differences were observed for MR(4.5) through 48 months or progression 
      to AP/BC by 48 months. LIMITATIONS: LIMITATIONS include comparisons based solely on 
      indirect evidence and HRs for MR(4.0) and MR(4.5) from the DASISION trial being 
      extracted from cumulative incidence curves. CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison 
      suggests that nilotinib is associated with higher rates of achieving MMR, MR(4.0), 
      and MR(4.5) by 12 months compared to dasatinib for the treatment of newly diagnosed 
      CML-CP. In addition, higher rates of MR achievement with nilotinib were also 
      maintained through 48 months of follow-up.

      in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with suboptimal glycaemic control with 
      oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Hence, the current analysis indirectly compared 
      available evidence on the risk of hypoglycaemia and weight change between 
      lixisenatide and NPH-insulin based on randomized controlled trial (RCT) data with 
      exenatide, insulin glargine and placebo as common references. METHODS: A systematic 
      search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane database and clinical registries identified 
      English- and German-language articles published from January 1980 to October 2012 
      reporting data from RCTs. Only publications of trials that reported outcomes from 24 
      to 30 weeks comparing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or basal insulin 
      versus another antidiabetic agent or placebo were included. Hypoglycaemia, patients 
      at glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) target and discontinuations due to adverse events 
      (AEs) were treated as binary variables, with risk ratios and odds ratios (ORs) 
      calculated. HbA1c and body weight were treated as continuous variables with 
      difference in mean change from baseline (MD) calculated. Meta-analyses were 
      performed with random effects models and indirect comparisons were performed 
      according to Bucher's method. RESULTS: Seven RCTs (n=3,301 patients) comparing the 
      efficacy and safety of lixisenatide, exenatide, insulin glargine and NPH-insulin 
      with different antidiabetic treatments in adult patients with T2DM were included in 
      the final analysis. In the adjusted indirect comparison, there was a significant 
      difference in symptomatic hypoglycaemia (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = [0.17, 0.85]) and in 
      confirmed hypoglycaemia (OR = 0.46; 95% CI = [0.22, 0.96]) favouring lixisenatide 
      over NPH-insulin and comparable changes in HbA1c from baseline (MD = 0.07%; 95% CI = 
      [-0.26%, 0.41%]). In contrast to NPH-insulin, there was a significant reduction in 
      body weight with lixisenatide (MD = -3.62 kg; 95% CI = [-5.86 kg, -1.38 kg]) at 
      study completion. The number of discontinuations due to AEs numerically favoured 
      NPH-insulin over lixisenatide (OR = 2.64; 95% CI = [0.25, 27.96]), with a broad 
      confidence interval. CONCLUSIONS: Lixisenatide treatment was associated with a lower 
      risk of hypoglycaemia and a greater weight loss compared with NPH-insulin. Glycaemic 
      control with lixisenatide treatment was comparable with NPH-insulin. These data 
      suggest that lixisenatide is a beneficial treatment option for T2DM patients with 
      inadequate glycaemic control on OADs, and is associated with reduced risk of 
      hypoglycaemia and weight gain.

AB  - Randomized control trials and its meta-analysis has occupied the pinnacle in levels 
      of evidence available for research. However, there were several limitations of these 
      trials. Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a recent tool for evidence-based medicine 
      that draws strength from direct and indirect evidence generated from randomized 
      control trials. It facilitates comparisons across multiple treatment options, direct 
      comparisons of which have not been attempted till date due to multitude of reasons. 
      These indirect treatment comparisons of randomized controlled trials are based on 
      similarity and consistency assumptions that follow Bayesian or frequentist 
      statistics. Most NMAuntil date use Microsoft Windows WinBUGs Software for analysis 
      which relies on Bayesian statistics. Methodology of NMA is expected to undergo 
      further refinements and become robust with usage. Power and precision of indirect 
      comparisons in NMA is a concern as it is dependent on effective number of trials, 
      sample size and complete statistical information. However, NMA can synthesize 
      results of considerable relevance to experts and policy makers.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of pharmacologic interventions in preventing relapse of Crohn's 
      disease after surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are several drugs that might decrease the risk of relapse 
      of Crohn's disease (CD) after surgery, but it is unclear whether one is superior to 
      others. We estimated the comparative efficacy of different pharmacologic 
      interventions for postoperative prophylaxis of CD, through a network meta-analysis 
      of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the 
      literature through March 2014. We identified randomized controlled trials that 
      compared the abilities of mesalamine, antibiotics, budesonide, immunomodulators, 
      anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF) (started within 3 months of surgery), and/or 
      placebo or no intervention to prevent clinical and/or endoscopic relapse of CD in 
      adults after surgical resection. We used Bayesian network meta-analysis to combine 
      direct and indirect evidence and estimate the relative effects of treatment. 
      RESULTS: We identified 21 trials comprising 2006 participants comparing 7 treatment 
      strategies. In a network meta-analysis, compared with placebo, mesalamine (relative 
      risk [RR], 0.60; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.37-0.88), antibiotics (RR, 0.26; 95% 
      CrI, 0.08-0.61), immunomodulator monotherapy (RR, 0.36; 95% CrI, 0.17-0.63), 
      immunomodulator with antibiotics (RR, 0.11; 95% CrI, 0.02-0.51), and anti-TNF 
      monotherapy (RR, 0.04; 95% CrI, 0.00-0.14), but not budesonide (RR, 0.93; 95% CrI, 
      0.40-1.84), reduced the risk of clinical relapse. Likewise, compared with placebo, 
      antibiotics (RR, 0.41; 95% CrI, 0.15-0.92), immunomodulator monotherapy (RR, 0.33; 
      95% CrI, 0.13-0.68), immunomodulator with antibiotics (RR, 0.16; 95% CrI, 
      0.04-0.48), and anti-TNF monotherapy (RR, 0.01; 95% CrI, 0.00-0.05), but neither 
      mesalamine (RR, 0.67; 95% CrI, 0.39-1.08) nor budesonide (RR, 0.86; 95% CrI, 
      0.61-1.22), reduced the risk of endoscopic relapse. Anti-TNF monotherapy was the 
      most effective pharmacologic intervention for postoperative prophylaxis, with large 
      effect sizes relative to all other strategies (clinical relapse: RR, 0.02-0.20; 
      endoscopic relapse: RR, 0.005-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Based on Bayesian network 
      meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons, anti-TNF 
      monotherapy appears to be the most effective strategy for postoperative prophylaxis 
      for CD.

TI  - [Cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared to other new oral anticoagulants in 
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation].
PG  - 43-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is associated with development of thromboembolic 
      events. New oral anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran) are 
      recommended for antithrombotic therapy in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) with moderate and high risk of stroke. OBJECTIVES: The objective 
      of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness ratio of apixaban compared to 
      dabigatran and rivaroxaban in patients with NVAF from the Russian Federation 
      national health care system perspective. METHODS: This analysis used a Markov model 
      that allowed estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for 
      apixaban compared to rivaroxaban and dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg over lifetime 
      horizon for patients with NVAF. The model enclosed cardiovascular event rates based 
      on the results of the indirect treatment comparison that combined data from the 
      randomized clinical trials comparing clinical effectiveness and safety of apixaban, 
      rivaroxaban and dabigatran with warfarin (ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, RE-LY). The 
      following cardiovascular events were considered: ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, 
      systemic embolism, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant 
      non-major bleeds and myocardial infarction. Direct medical costs were determined 
      based on the rates of the compulsory national medical insurance system. The price of 
      the new oral anticoagulants was taken as a weighted average tender price for the 
      year 2013. In the model both costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life years and 
      life-years) were discounted at 3.5%. Cost-effectiveness threshold was set at 1.4 
      million rubles per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and corresponded to the 
      three times GDP per capita in 2013 in the Russian Federation. RESULTS: In the base 
      case analysis it was demonstrated that apixaban compared to dabigatran 110 mg and 
      150 mg and rivaroxaban provided additional 0.101, 0.060 and 0.072 life years as well 
      as additional 0.063; 0.038 and 0.041 QALYs respectively. Over lifetime horizon 
      apixaban compared to dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg and rivaroxaban required 
      additional treatment costs equal to 22.78; 31.18 and 6.70 thousands rubles, 
      respectively. With that estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for apixaban 
      compared to dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg and rivaroxaban was 362.60, 805.54 and 
      162.45 thousands rubles per QALY correspondingly. CONCLUSION: Apixaban provided 
      increased life expectancy compared to other new anticoagulants and may be considered 
      as a cost-effective alternative to dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg and rivaroxaban from 
      the Russian Federation national health care system perspective.

BTI - Core Needle and Open Surgical Biopsy for Diagnosis of Breast Lesions: An Update to 
      the 2009 Report
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Core needle biopsy and open surgical biopsy are the most frequently used 
      procedures for diagnosis of suspicious breast lesions. An AHRQ evidence report on 
      the comparative effectiveness and adverse events of breast biopsy methods was 
      completed in 2009. The availability of additional studies and the uncertainties 
      surrounding newer biopsy techniques prompted an update of that report. STUDY 
      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We searched nine electronic databases (last search on December 
      16, 2013) for English-language full-text reports of prospective or retrospective 
      cohort studies of women not previously diagnosed with breast cancer who were 
      undergoing biopsy for diagnosis of a breast lesion. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS 
      METHODS: A single investigator extracted quantitative and qualitative data from each 
      study; a second reviewer verified extracted data. We assessed the strength and 
      applicability of the evidence. We performed Bayesian meta-analyses to estimate 
      summary test performance and performed indirect comparisons to assess the relative 
      effectiveness of alternative core needle biopsy methods. Statistical models 
      accounted for between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty studies of 
      moderate to high risk of bias provided information on the test performance of 
      alternative core needle biopsy techniques. We found one new study investigating the 
      test performance of open biopsy. For women at average risk of cancer, both 
      ultrasound- and stereotactically guided biopsies had average sensitivities higher 
      than 0.97 and average specificities ranging from 0.92 to 0.99; freehand biopsy 
      methods had average sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.98. However, evidence 
      on the test performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy (6 
      studies) was insufficient to draw conclusions. Test performance did not differ 
      between women at average and high baseline risk of cancer, but results were 
      imprecise. Test performance of automated and vacuum-assisted devices (when using the 
      same imaging guidance) was fairly similar (absolute differences in sensitivity and 
      specificity ≤ 0.1). One hundred and forty-one studies contributed information on 
      potential harms of different core needle biopsy techniques. Overall, core needle 
      biopsy had a lower risk of complications than open surgical biopsy; however 
      information on the latter was sparse. The absolute incidence of adverse events was 
      low and the incidence of severe complications was less than 1 percent for all 
      techniques. Vacuum-assisted procedures appeared to be associated with increased 
      bleeding and hematoma formation; biopsies performed with patients seated upright 
      appeared to be associated with increased risk of vasovagal reactions. Harms were 
      reported inconsistently, raising concerns about selective outcome reporting. We 
      found 10 case reports of patients developing tumors at the site of prior core needle 
      biopsies. We found information on only a few patient-relevant and resource-related 
      outcomes. Based on 42 studies, core needle biopsy obviated the need for surgical 
      procedures in about 75 percent of women. Meta-analysis of 10 studies reporting the 
      number of surgical procedures required after biopsy suggested that the odds of 
      requiring only one procedure were almost 15 times as high among women receiving core 
      needle biopsy, as compared to those receiving open surgical biopsy. However, this 
      result may be confounded by indication. LIMITATIONS: Patient-level data were 
      unavailable and information about study- or population-level characteristics was too 
      limited to allow the identification of modifiers of test performance, adverse 
      events, or clinical outcomes. Studies reported adverse events incompletely, and did 
      not provide details of their outcome ascertainment methods. CONCLUSIONS: A large 
      body of evidence suggests that ultrasound and stereotactically guided core needle 
      biopsy procedures have sensitivity and specificity close to that of open biopsy 
      procedures, and are associated with fewer adverse events. The strength of the 
      evidence on the test performance of these methods is deemed moderate because studies 
      are at medium to high risk of bias, but provide precise and fairly consistent 
      results. Freehand procedures have lower sensitivity than imaging-guided methods. The 
      strength of evidence on the comparative test performance of automated and 
      vacuum-assisted devices (when using the same imaging guidance) is deemed low, 
      because of concerns about the risk of bias of included studies and the reliance on 
      indirect comparisons. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions for 
      MRI-guided biopsy or women at high baseline risk of cancer. There is low strength of 
      evidence that vacuum-assisted procedures have a higher risk of bleeding than 
      automated methods. There is moderate strength of evidence that women diagnosed with 
      breast cancer by core needle biopsy are more likely to have their cancer treated 
      with a single surgical procedure, compared with women diagnosed by open surgical 
      biopsy.

TI  - Once-daily long-acting beta-agonists for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an 
      indirect comparison of olodaterol and indacaterol.
PG  - 813-24
LID - 10.2147/COPD.S59673 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In the absence of head-to-head clinical trials comparing the once-daily, 
      long-acting beta2-agonists olodaterol and indacaterol for the treatment of chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an indirect treatment comparison by systematic 
      review and synthesis of the available clinical evidence was conducted. METHODS: A 
      systematic literature review of randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients 
      with COPD was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olodaterol and 
      indacaterol. Network meta-analysis and adjusted indirect comparison methods were 
      employed to evaluate treatment efficacy, using outcomes based on trough forced 
      expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Transition Dyspnea Index, St George's 
      Respiratory Questionnaire total score and response, rescue medication use, and 
      proportion of patients with exacerbations. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were identified 
      for meta-analysis (eight, olodaterol; ten, indacaterol). Olodaterol trials included 
      patients of all severities, whilst indacaterol trials excluded patients with very 
      severe COPD. Concomitant maintenance bronchodilator use was allowed in most 
      olodaterol trials, but not in indacaterol trials. When similarly designed 
      trials/data were analyzed for change from baseline in trough FEV1 (liters), the 
      following mean differences (95% confidence interval) were observed: trials excluding 
      concomitant bronchodilator: indacaterol 75 mcg versus olodaterol 5 mcg, -0.005 
      (-0.077 to 0.067), and indacaterol 150 mcg versus olodaterol 5 mcg, 0.020 (-0.036 to 
      0.077); trials with concomitant tiotropium: indacaterol 150 mcg versus olodaterol 5 
      mcg, 0.000 (-0.043 to 0.042). In sensitivity analyses of the full network, results 
      for change from baseline in trough FEV1 favored indacaterol, but this dataset 
      suffered from trial design heterogeneity. For the other endpoints investigated, no 
      statistically significant differences were found when analyzed in the full network. 
      CONCLUSION: When compared under similar trial conditions, olodaterol and indacaterol 
      have similar efficacy in patients with COPD. This research highlights the importance 
      of considering the concomitant COPD medication when evaluating treatment effects in 
      COPD.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin and metronidazole in 
      Clostridium difficile infections: a meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparison.
PG  - 2892-900
LID - 10.1093/jac/dku261 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of fidaxomicin treatment, which has a limited 
      effect on the normal gut flora, compared with vancomycin and metronidazole treatment 
      in Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs). METHODS: A systematic literature review 
      was conducted in July to August 2011 and updated in July 2013. For fidaxomicin 
      versus vancomycin, efficacy was evaluated using meta-analysis of data from two Phase 
      III direct comparative studies (n = 1164). As there were no studies comparing 
      fidaxomicin and metronidazole, an indirect comparison was made using data from three 
      vancomycin versus metronidazole studies (n = 345), using the methodology of Bucher 
      et al. (J Clin Epidemiol 1997; 50: 683-91). This provides an OR for the indirect 
      comparison of fidaxomicin versus metronidazole when direct evidence of fidaxomicin 
      versus vancomycin and vancomycin versus metronidazole is available. RESULTS: 
      Clinical cure rates were similar for fidaxomicin and vancomycin; the OR (95% CI) was 
      1.17 (0.82, 1.66). Recurrence [0.47 (0.34, 0.65)] was significantly lower and 
      sustained cure rates [1.75 (1.35, 2.27)] significantly higher for fidaxomicin than 
      vancomycin. Similar results were obtained in patient subgroups with severe CDI and 
      with non-severe CDI. From the indirect comparison, the likelihood of recurrence 
      [0.42 (0.18, 0.96)] and sustained cure [2.55 (1.44, 4.51)] were significantly 
      improved for fidaxomicin versus metronidazole. Again, similar results were obtained 
      in those with severe and non-severe CDI. CONCLUSIONS: Fidaxomicin provides improved 
      sustained cure rates in patients with CDI compared with vancomycin. An indirect 
      comparison indicates that the same is also true for fidaxomicin versus 
      metronidazole. In view of these data, fidaxomicin may be considered as first-line 
      therapy for CDI.

TI  - Dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban for extended venous thromboembolism treatment: 
      network meta-analysis.
PG  - 301-8
AB  - AIM: Many new oral anticoagulants (NOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) are 
      currently available to treat thromboembolic disease. There are no head-to-head 
      trials comparing these agents. To assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs for 
      prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), we performed a network 
      meta-analysis. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane-controlled trial register 
      were searched, without language restriction, to identify trials. Studies were 
      evaluated according to a priori inclusion criteria and appraised using established 
      internal validity criteria. Adjusted indirect comparisons between agents were 
      performed using well-established methods. RESULTS: Three trials meeting inclusion 
      criteria were identified. Direct comparison between apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily 
      (BID) versus apixaban 5 mg BID showed no difference for any outcome. Clinically 
      relevant non-major bleeding occurred less with both apixaban 2.5 mg BID (OR 0.23, 
      95% CI 0.08-0.62, P=0.004) and apixaban 5 mg BID [OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.82, 
      P=0.019] compared to rivaroxaban 20 mg daily. Apixaban 2.5 mg BID showed less 
      clinically relevant non-major bleeding than dabigatran 150 mg BID [OR 0.4, 95% CI 
      0.16-0.9, P=0.04], but not apixaban 5 mg BID. There were no differences between 
      rivaroxaban 20 mg daily and dabigatran 150 mg BID. No differences in risk for 
      recurrent VTE, major bleeding, or mortality were observed for any comparison between 
      any pair of NOACs. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in risk for 
      recurrent VTE, major bleeding, or all-cause mortality between the NOACs. However, 
      apixaban 2.5 mg BID was associated with less clinically significant non-major 
      bleeding than either rivaroxaban 20 mg daily or dabigatran 150 mg BID.

TI  - Indirect comparisons of efficacy and safety between seven newer targeted agents for 
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma: A network meta-analysis of randomised clinical 
      trials.
PG  - 858-864
AB  - This network meta-analysis aimed to compare the clinical efficacy and safety among 7 
      newer targeted agents for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). 
      All randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of targeted therapeutic drugs for mRCC were 
      included. The study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were performed 
      independently by two reviewers. The analysis evaluated efficacy outcomes 
      [improvement in the median progression-free survival (PFS)] and safety outcomes 
      (number of withdrawals due to adverse events). The network analysis included direct 
      and indirect analyses. The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the 
      Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method. 
      We identified 7 articles eligible for inclusion in the study. The direct comparison 
      of the targeted agents indicated better efficacy in terms of longer PFS, but worse 
      safety (more withdrawals due to adverse events). The indirect analysis demonstrated 
      that axitinib was significantly more effective compared to panzopanib; sunitinib was 
      superior to sorafenib and temsirolimus regarding efficacy outcome, without any 
      statistically significant difference in the safety outcome. The results of the 
      quality assessment indicated moderate scores using the GRADE method. In conclusion, 
      the result of this network analysis suggested that sunitinib and axitinib may be 
      more clinically efficient and axitinib is associated with a lower risk of adverse 
      events compared to sorafenib, pazopanib and temsirolimus.

TI  - Adjusted indirect treatment comparison of the bioavailability of WHO-prequalified 
      first-line generic antituberculosis medicines.
PG  - 580-8
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2014.144 [doi]
AB  - Approval of generic medicines is based on bioequivalence with the innovator product, 
      but it is not unusual for generics to be interchanged with each other. This study 
      investigated the differences in bioavailability between World Health 
      Organization-prequalified antituberculosis generics by means of indirect comparisons 
      to ensure interchangeability between these diverse generics. Data on 22 products 
      containing isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, or ethambutol in single- or 
      fixed-dose combination were included. The indirect comparison between generics shows 
      that the differences, expressed as 90% confidence intervals, are always less than 
      30%. Furthermore, assurances regarding interchangeability of two generic products 
      are reduced when either the point estimate ratios in the original studies are 
      shifted from unity by more than 5% or when the width of the 90% confidence interval 
      is large. From a bioequivalence perspective, not only are the generics bioequivalent 
      with the reference but also all these generics can be interchanged without 
      safety/efficacy concerns.

TI  - Chemotherapy regimens for advanced pancreatic cancer: a systematic review and 
      network meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced pancreatic cancer confers poor prognosis and treatment 
      advancement has been slow. Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have 
      demonstrated survival benefits for combination therapy compared to gemcitabine 
      alone. However, the comparative benefits and harms of available combination 
      chemotherapy treatments are not clear. We therefore conducted a systematic review 
      and Bayesian network meta-analysis to assess the comparative safety and efficacy of 
      chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: 
      MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Registry of Clinical trials and abstracts 
      from major scientific meetings were searched for RCTs published from 2002 to 2013. 
      Key outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and safety 
      including grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue 
      and sensory neuropathy. Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted to calculate 
      survival and safety outcomes using gemcitabine (GEM) as the reference comparator. 
      Effect estimates and 95% credible intervals were calculated for each comparison. 
      Mean ranks and the probability of being best were obtained for each treatment 
      analyzed in the network meta-analysis. RESULTS: The search identified 23 studies 
      involving 19 different treatment regimens and 9,989 patients. FOLFIRINOX, 
      GEM/cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU (PEFG), GEM/NAB-paclitaxel (NAB-P), 
      GEM/erlotinib+/-bevacizumab, GEM/capecitabine, and GEM/oxaliplatin were associated 
      with statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS relative to gemcitabine 
      alone and several other treatments. They were amongst the top ranked for survival 
      outcomes amongst other treatments included. No significant differences were found 
      for other combination chemotherapy treatments. Effect estimates from indirect 
      comparisons matched closely to estimates derived from pairwise comparisons. Overall, 
      combination therapies had greater risk for evaluated grade 3-4 toxicities over 
      gemcitabine alone. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head comparisons, we 
      performed a mixed-treatment analysis to achieve high-quality information on the 
      effectiveness and safety of each treatment. This study suggests that some 
      combination therapies may offer greater benefits in the treatment of advanced 
      pancreatic cancer than others. To more fully elucidate the comparative benefits and 
      harms of different combination chemotherapy regimens, rigorously conducted 
      comparative studies, or network meta-analysis of patient-level data are required.

TI  - Bazedoxifene versus oral bisphosphonates for the prevention of nonvertebral 
      fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at higher risk of fracture: a 
      network meta-analysis.
PG  - 424-32
LID - S1098-3015(14)00016-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2014.01.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of bazedoxifene and oral bisphosphonates for the 
      prevention of nonvertebral fractures (NVFs) in women with higher risk of 
      postmenopausal osteoporosis (i.e., the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool [FRAX] score ≥ 
      20%), based on currently available evidence from randomized controlled trials. 
      METHODS: Randomized controlled trials evaluating the NVF relative risk reduction 
      (RRR) with oral bisphosphonates or bazedoxifene were identified by a systematic 
      literature review and combined by means of a network meta-analysis. A subgroup of 
      patients with a FRAX score of 20% or more in the bazedoxifene phase III osteoporosis 
      study was selected as the population of interest on the basis of the bazedoxifene 
      label. In one analysis (analysis 1), the placebo response of the subgroup with a 
      FRAX score of 20% or more was the benchmark to select comparable bisphosphonate 
      trials. Additional analyses incorporated the aggregate data from the bisphosphonate 
      trials with all the FRAX subgroups (analysis 2) or with the individual patient data 
      from the bazedoxifene trial (analysis 3). RESULTS: Nine identified bisphosphonate 
      trials (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate; N = 23,440 patients) with a similar 
      placebo response as observed for the subgroup of high risk patients in the 
      bazedoxifene trial were included in analysis 1. The results of the network 
      meta-analysis of this study set suggest that bazedoxifene is expected to have an RRR 
      of 0.43 (95% credible interval [CrI] -0.19 to 0.72) versus alendronate, 0.58 (95% 
      CrI 0.05-0.81) versus ibandronate, and 0.39 (95% CrI -0.29 to 0.70) versus 
      risedronate. Analyses in which treatment effects with bisphosphonates were projected 
      to a population with a FRAX score of 20% or more with meta-regression approaches 
      (analysis 2 and analysis 3) provide similar findings. CONCLUSION: Based on an 
      indirect comparison of randomized trials, bazedoxifene is expected to have at least 
      a comparable RRR of NVF as alendronate, ibandronate, and risedronate in women with 
      higher risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of study identification methods and network size 
      on the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of recommended pharmacological 
      venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) prophylaxis for adult patients undergoing 
      elective total knee replacement surgery in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A stepwise 
      literature search specifically designed to identify indirect evidence was conducted 
      to extend the original clinical review from the latest National Institute for Health 
      and Care Excellence (NICE) VTE technology appraisal. Different network sizes or 
      network orders, based on the successive searches, informed three network 
      meta-analyses (NMAs), which were compared with a replicated base case. The resulting 
      comparative estimates were inputted in an economic model to investigate the effect 
      of network size on cost-effectiveness probabilities. RESULTS: Searches increased the 
      number of indirect comparisons between VTE interventions, progressively widening the 
      relevant network of studies for NMA. Precision around mean relative treatment 
      effects was increased as the network was extended from the base case to first-order 
      NMA, but further extensions had limited effect. Cost-effectiveness analysis results 
      were largely insensitive to variation in clinical inputs from the different NMA 
      orders. CONCLUSIONS: No standard methodology is currently recommended by NICE to 
      identify the most relevant network of studies for NMA. Our study showed that 
      optimizing the identification of studies for NMA can extend the evidence base for 
      analysis and reduce the uncertainty in relative effectiveness estimates. Although in 
      our example network extensions did not affect the acceptability of available 
      treatments in VTE prevention based on cost-effectiveness results, it may in other 
      applications.

TI  - Medication effectiveness with the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors among 
      Texas Medicaid patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 657-67
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adalimumab (Humira [ADA]), etanercept (Enbrel [ETN]), and infliximab 
      (Remicade [IFX]) are tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors indicated for the 
      treatment of a variety of disorders. While their effectiveness has not been directly 
      compared in a clinical trial, results from the majority of the indirect treatment 
      comparisons suggest comparable efficacy and safety profiles. However, these TNF 
      inhibitor agents differ in administration method and dosing flexibility, which may 
      result in differences in medication use profiles (e.g., adherence, persistence, 
      discontinuation, dose escalation, and switching to a new biologic rheumatoid 
      arthritis drug) and effectiveness in clinical practice.  OBJECTIVE: To estimate the 
      effectiveness of ADA, ETN, and IFX in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using 
      a validated, claims-based algorithm designed for large retrospective databases. 
      METHODS: Adult (aged 18-63 years) patients diagnosed with RA, and receiving ADA, 
      ETN, or IFX, and insured by Texas Medicaid were included. The index date was the 
      date of the first prescription claim for ADA or ETN or infusion record for IFX with 
      no claim or infusion record of a biologic drug in the preceding 6 months (i.e., 
      biologic naïve). The study time frame was from July 2003 to August 2011, and 
      prescription and medical claims for each subject were analyzed over an 18-month 
      period (6 months pre- and 12 months post-index). Based on a RA medication 
      effectiveness algorithm (Curtis et al. 2011), a RA medication was classified as 
      effective if each of the following 6 criteria were met: (1) high medication 
      adherence (i.e., medication possession ratio [MPR] ≥ 80%, defined as the sum of 
      days' supply for all fills or infusions divided by the number of days in the study 
      period); (2) no switching to (or addition of) new biologic RA drugs; (3) no addition 
      of new nonbiologic RA drugs; (4) no increase in dose or frequency of administration 
      of the RA medication currently evaluated; (5) no more than 1 glucocorticoid (GC) 
      joint injection; and (6) no increase in dose of a concurrent oral GC. Propensity 
      score (PS) matching was employed, and paired tests (i.e., McNemar's) and 
      multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis were used to compare groups. 
      Demographic (i.e., age, gender, race) and clinical (i.e., use of nonbiologic 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], pain medication use, GC medication 
      use, RA-related and non-RA-related health care visits [i.e., ambulatory and 
      inpatient visits], number of nonstudy RA medications, and comorbidity index) 
      characteristics, including total health care utilization cost at baseline, served as 
      study covariates. RESULTS: After PS matching, 822 patients (n = 274 per group) were 
      included. The majority of the sample (69.2%) was between 45-63 years, female (88%), 
      and Hispanic (53.7%). Results for each TNF inhibitor differed significantly for 2 of 
      the 6 effectiveness criteria (i.e., medication adherence and dose escalation). A 
      significantly higher proportion of patients on IFX were adherent compared with 
      patients on ETN or ADA (38.3% vs. 16.4% and 21.2%, P  less than  0.0001 for both). 
      Adherence rates between ETN and ADA were not significantly different. A 
      significantly higher (P  less than  0.0001) proportion of patients on ETN had no 
      dose escalation compared with patients on ADA or IFX (98.2% vs. 88.7% and 80.3%, P  
      less than  0.0001). Dose escalation rate was also significantly lower (P = 0.0106) 
      for ADA compared with IFX. The multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis 
      indicated no significant difference in overall effectiveness using the claims-based 
      algorithm among the 3 TNF inhibitors nor any significant relationship between 
      effectiveness and the study covariates.  CONCLUSION: The study results suggest that 
      when using a medication effectiveness algorithm, IFX, ETN, and ADA have comparable 
      effectiveness in patients with RA. Patient adherence to therapy may be higher if 
      given IFX, and patients who receive ETN are less likely to have a dose escalation.

TI  - Uterine-sparing minimally invasive interventions in women with uterine fibroids: a 
      systematic review and indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis.
PG  - 858-67
LID - 10.1111/aogs.12441 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of uterine-sparing interventions for women 
      with symptomatic uterine fibroids who wish to preserve their uterus. DESIGN: 
      Systematic review and indirect comparison meta-analysis. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      CENTRAL, conference proceedings, trial registers and reference lists were searched 
      up to October 2013 for randomized controlled trials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome 
      measures were patient satisfaction, re-intervention and complications rates, 
      reproductive outcomes, and hospitalization and recovery times. RESULTS: Five trials, 
      involving 436 women were included; two compared uterine artery embolization with 
      myomectomy and three compared uterine artery embolization with laparoscopic uterine 
      artery occlusion. Indirect treatment comparison showed that myomectomy and uterine 
      artery embolization resulted in higher rates of patient satisfaction (odds ratio 
      2.56, 95% credible interval 0.56-11.75 and 2.7, 95% credible interval 1.1-7.14, 
      respectively) and lower rates of clinical failure (odds ratio 0.29, 95% credible 
      interval 0.06-1.46 and 0.37, 95% credible interval 0.13-0.93, respectively) than 
      laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion. Myomectomy resulted in lower re-intervention 
      rate than uterine artery embolization (odds ratio 0.08, 95% credible interval 
      0.02-0.27) and laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion (odds ratio 0.08, 95% credible 
      interval 0.01-0.37) even though the latter techniques had an advantage over 
      myomectomy because of shorter hospitalization and quicker recovery. There was no 
      evidence of difference between the three techniques in ovarian failure and 
      complications rates. The evidence for reproductive outcomes is poor. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study's results suggest that laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion is less effective 
      than uterine artery embolization and myomectomy in treatment of symptomatic 
      fibroids. The choice between uterine artery embolization and myomectomy should be 
      based on individuals' expectations and fully informed discussion.

TI  - Preservative-free latanoprost eye drops in patients with primary open-angle 
      glaucoma/ocular hypertension.
PG  - 521-8
LID - 10.1007/s40261-014-0203-4 [doi]
AB  - Latanoprost is an ester prodrug prostaglandin F2α analogue that is a selective 
      agonist of endogenous prostanoid FP receptors and that reduces intraocular pressure 
      (IOP) by increasing the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humour. Preservative-free 
      (PF) latanoprost [Monoprost(®)] is a new formulation of latanoprost that is approved 
      for use in the EU in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)/ocular 
      hypertension. This article reviews the clinical pharmacology of this new 
      formulation, focussing on its efficacy and tolerability in this indication. PF 
      latanoprost was efficacious in reducing IOP in a randomized, investigator-masked, 
      multinational trial in patients with POAG/ocular hypertension (n = 404). At days 15, 
      42 and 84 of follow-up, PF latanoprost was noninferior to benzalkonium 
      chloride-preserved (BAK) latanoprost in terms of reductions in IOP. In this trial, 
      at days 42 and 84 the proportions of patients with conjunctival hyperaemia were 
      significantly lower with PF latanoprost than with BAK latanoprost. Patient 
      subjective ratings of ocular symptoms were also significantly lower with PF 
      latanoprost than with BAK latanoprost. In the absence of head-to-head comparisons 
      with other anti-glaucoma drugs, an adjusted, indirect comparison meta-analysis was 
      performed using data from 21 randomized clinical trials in patients with POAG/ocular 
      hypertension. Based on this analysis, PF latanoprost had similar efficacy to 
      different formulations of three comparator prostaglandin analogues in reducing the 
      patient's IOP and was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing 
      hyperaemia/ocular redness than these comparators. PF latanoprost offers a useful 
      alternative to the available preserved prostaglandin analogues for the treatment of 
      POAG/ocular hypertension.

TI  - Investigation of continuous effect modifiers in a meta-analysis on higher versus 
      lower PEEP in patients requiring mechanical ventilation--protocol of the ICEM study.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/2046-4053-3-46 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Categorizing an inherently continuous predictor in prognostic analyses 
      raises several critical methodological issues: dependence of the statistical 
      significance on the number and position of the chosen cut-point(s), loss of 
      statistical power, and faulty interpretation of the results if a non-linear 
      association is incorrectly assumed to be linear. This also applies to a therapeutic 
      context where investigators of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are interested in 
      interactions between treatment assignment and one or more continuous predictors. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: Our goal is to apply the multivariable fractional polynomial 
      interaction (MFPI) approach to investigate interactions between continuous patient 
      baseline variables and the allocated treatment in an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of three RCTs (N = 2,299) from the intensive care field. For each 
      study, MFPI will provide a continuous treatment effect function. Functions from each 
      of the three studies will be averaged by a novel meta-analysis approach for 
      functions. We will plot treatment effect functions separately for each study and 
      also the averaged function. The averaged function with a related confidence interval 
      will provide a suitable basis to assess whether a continuous patient characteristic 
      modifies the treatment comparison and may be relevant for clinical decision-making. 
      The compared interventions will be a higher or lower positive end-expiratory 
      pressure (PEEP) ventilation strategy in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. 
      The continuous baseline variables body mass index, PaO2/FiO2, respiratory 
      compliance, and oxygenation index will be the investigated potential effect 
      modifiers. Clinical outcomes for this analysis will be in-hospital mortality, time 
      to death, time to unassisted breathing, and pneumothorax. DISCUSSION: This project 
      will be the first meta-analysis to combine continuous treatment effect functions 
      derived by the MFPI procedure separately in each of several RCTs. Such an approach 
      requires individual patient data (IPD). They are available from an earlier IPD 
      meta-analysis using different methods for analysis. This new analysis strategy 
      allows assessing whether treatment effects interact with continuous baseline patient 
      characteristics and avoids categorization-based subgroup analyses. These interaction 
      analyses of the present study will be exploratory in nature. However, they may help 
      to foster future research using the MFPI approach to improve interaction analyses of 
      continuous predictors in RCTs and IPD meta-analyses. This study is registered in 
      PROSPERO (CRD42012003129).

PG  - 881-96
LID - 10.1586/14787210.2014.917046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate and quantify the risk of serious opportunistic 
      infections after induction with polyclonal antibodies versus IL-2 receptor 
      antagonists (IL-2RAs) in randomized clinical trials. METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were 
      followed and random-effects models were performed. RESULTS: 70 randomized clinical 
      trials (10,106 patients) were selected: 36 polyclonal antibodies (n = 3377), and 34 
      IL-2RAs (n = 6729). Compared to controls, polyclonal antibodies showed higher risk 
      of serious opportunistic infections (OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.34-2.80; p < 0.0001); 
      IL-2RAs were associated with lower risk of serious opportunistic infections (OR: 
      0.80, 95% CI: 0.68-0.94; p = 0.009). Polyclonal antibodies were associated with 
      higher risk of bacterial (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.00-2.50; p = 0.049) and viral 
      infections (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.60-3.49; p < 0.0001), while IL-2RAs were associated 
      with lower risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56-0.97; p = 
      0.032). Adjusted indirect comparison: compared to polyclonal antibodies, IL-2RAs 
      were associated with lower risk of serious opportunistic infections (OR: 0.41, 95% 
      CI: 0.34-0.49; p < 0.0001), bacterial infections (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.39-0.67; p < 
      0.0001) and CMV disease (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.34-0.98; p = 0.043). Results remained 
      consistent across allografts. CONCLUSION: The risk of serious opportunistic 
      infections, bacterial infections and CMV disease were all significantly decreased 
      with IL-2RAs compared to polyclonal antibodies.

TI  - Incidence of Severe Nephrotoxicity With Cisplatin Based on Renal Function 
      Eligibility Criteria: Indirect Comparison Meta-analysis.
PG  - 497-506
LID - 10.1097/COC.0000000000000081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this meta-analysis was to indirectly compare incidence 
      of nephrotoxicity in trials using cisplatin (CIS) for treatment of solid tumors when 
      renal function was assessed using serum creatinine (SCr) or creatinine clearance 
      (CrCl) for eligibility criteria. METHODS: Randomized trials comparing CIS-containing 
      with non-CIS-containing chemotherapy regimens were identified in PubMed. Included 
      studies were performed from 1990 to 2010, used SCr or CrCl as an eligibility 
      criterion, and reported incidence of grade ≥3 nephrotoxicity for both treatment arms 
      using World Health Organization (WHO) or National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity 
      criteria. The relative risk (RR) of grade ≥3 nephrotoxicity associated with CIS 
      versus non-CIS regimens was examined. Subgroup analyses, adjusted indirect 
      comparison, and metaregression were used to compare SCr and CrCl. RESULTS: The 
      literature search identified 2359 studies, 42 studies met all the inclusion criteria 
      (N=9521 patients). SCr was used as an eligibility criterion in 20 studies (N=4704), 
      CrCl was used in 9 studies (N=1650), and either was used in 13 studies (N=3167). The 
      overall RR for developing nephrotoxicity with CIS versus non-CIS treatment was 1.75 
      (P=0.005). Subgroup analyses showed an increased risk when SCr was used (RR=2.60, 
      P=0.005) but not when CrCl was used (RR=1.50, P=0.19). Both the adjusted indirect 
      comparison and metaregression showed a nonsignificantly reduced risk of 
      nephrotoxicity when CrCl was used. CONCLUSIONS: CIS-based therapy was associated 
      with a significant increase in severe nephrotoxicity. The risk of severe 
      nephrotoxicity appears to be lower when CrCl was used to determine whether people 
      should be treated with CIS.

AB  - Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have long been fundamental tools for 
      evidence-based clinical practice. Initially, meta-analyses were proposed as a 
      technique that could improve the accuracy and the statistical power of previous 
      research from individual studies with small sample size. However, one of its main 
      limitations has been the fact of being able to compare no more than two treatments 
      in an analysis, even when the clinical research question necessitates that we 
      compare multiple interventions. Network meta-analysis (NMA) uses novel statistical 
      methods that incorporate information from both direct and indirect treatment 
      comparisons in a network of studies examining the effects of various competing 
      treatments, estimating comparisons between many treatments in a single analysis. 
      Despite its potential limitations, NMA applications in clinical epidemiology can be 
      of great value in situations where there are several treatments that have been 
      compared against a common comparator. Also, NMA can be relevant to a research or 
      clinical question when many treatments must be considered or when there is a mix of 
      both direct and indirect information in the body of evidence.

TI  - Indirect comparison of bazedoxifene vs oral bisphosphonates for the prevention of 
      vertebral fractures in postmenopausal osteoporotic women.
PG  - 1617-26
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2014.908279 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare the efficacy of bazedoxifene with oral bisphosphonates for 
      reduction of vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal osteoporotic (PMO) women and 
      in higher-risk patients based on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 
      METHODS: Eight RCTs assessing vertebral fracture risk reduction with oral 
      bisphosphonates (n = 7) or bazedoxifene (n = 1) were identified by a systematic 
      literature review. Individual study results were pooled in a network meta-analysis 
      (NMA) to indirectly compare treatment effects for overall PMO women and a 
      higher-risk subgroup (FRAX ≥ 20%). Three sets of NMA analyses were conducted: 
      aggregate data (AD) from the bisphosphonate RCTs and bazedoxifene RCT for the full 
      population or the FRAX ≥20% subgroup (NMA AD); bisphosphonate AD and bazedoxifene AD 
      from each FRAX subgroup adjusted for baseline risk (NMA AD meta-regression); and 
      bisphosphonate AD and bazedoxifene individual patient data (IPD) adjusted for 
      baseline risk/FRAX (NMA AD/IPD meta-regression). RESULTS: For the overall 
      population, bisphosphonates had lower fracture risks versus bazedoxifene although 
      there is considerable uncertainty in supporting one intervention over another. The 
      relative risk reduction (RRR) for bazedoxifene was -0.23 (95% CrI: -1.11, 0.27) 
      versus ibandronate, -0.17 (-0.76, 0.22) versus alendronate, and -0.06 (-0.62, 0.30) 
      versus risedronate. RESULTS from the meta-regression analyses were similar. For the 
      FRAX ≥20% population, estimated fracture rates with bazedoxifene were lower than 
      with bisphosphonates, but again the uncertainty limits strong interpretation. The 
      RRR for bazedoxifene was 0.51 (-0.31, 0.83) versus ibandronate, 0.53 (-0.18, 0.83) 
      versus alendronate, and 0.57 (-0.07, 0.85) versus risedronate. The meta-regression 
      analyses showed comparable findings. CONCLUSION: The analyses only considered 
      vertebral fractures for oral bisphosphonates versus bazedoxifene, and IPD was 
      available only for bazedoxifene. In light of this, bazedoxifene is comparable to 
      bisphosphonates in the overall PMO population and at least as effective as 
      bisphosphonates for preventing vertebral fractures among higher-risk PMO patients. 
      The findings suggest bazedoxifene performs better in higher-risk PMO than in the 
      overall PMO.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been compared to a 
      parenteral anticoagulant/oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the treatment of acute 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and adjusted 
      indirect comparison meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of NOACs for 
      this indication. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search through 
      November 2013 for randomized trials that evaluated treatment of acute VTE with a 
      NOAC including rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban. Trials had to report 
      at least one of the following outcomes of interest: mortality, recurrent VTE, 
      recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or major 
      bleeding. Included trials were evaluated for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 
      tool. We performed an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis to evaluate the 
      comparative efficacy and safety of NOACs, reporting relative risks (RRs) and 95% 
      confidence intervals for each outcome. RESULTS: Six trials (n=27,069) met inclusion 
      criteria, one each evaluating apixaban and edoxaban and two trials each evaluating 
      rivaroxaban and dabigatran. Risk of bias was low for all trials. NOACS did not 
      differ significantly in the risk of mortality, recurrent VTE, recurrent PE or 
      recurrent DVT. Dabigatran increased major bleeding risk compared to apixaban [RR 
      2.69 (1.19 to 6.07)] as did edoxaban compared to apixaban [RR 2.74 (1.40 to 5.39)]. 
      CONCLUSION: Although NOACs do not appear to differ in the efficacy of treating acute 
      VTE, data suggests apixaban to be the safer than some of its competitors.

AB  - Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials have long been important 
      synthesis tools for guiding evidence-based medicine. More recently, network 
      meta-analyses, an extension of traditional meta-analyses enabling the comparison of 
      multiple interventions, use new statistical methods to incorporate clinical evidence 
      from both direct and indirect treatment comparisons in a network of treatments and 
      associated trials. There is a need to provide education to ensure that core 
      methodological considerations underlying network meta-analyses are well understood 
      by readers and researchers to maximize their ability to appropriately interpret 
      findings and appraise validity. Network meta-analyses are highly informative for 
      assessing the comparative effects of multiple competing interventions in clinical 
      practice and are a valuable tool for health technology assessment and comparative 
      effectiveness research.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Some have suggested the quality of reporting of network meta-analyses 
      (a technique used to synthesize information to compare multiple interventions) is 
      sub-optimal. We sought to review information addressing this claim. OBJECTIVE: To 
      conduct an overview of existing evaluations of quality of reporting in network 
      meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons, and to compile a list of topics 
      which may require detailed reporting guidance to enhance future reporting quality. 
      METHODS: An electronic search of Medline and the Cochrane Registry of methodologic 
      studies (January 2004-August 2013) was performed by an information specialist. 
      Studies describing findings from quality of reporting assessments were sought. 
      Screening of abstracts and full texts was performed by two team members. Descriptors 
      related to all aspects of reporting a network meta-analysis were summarized. 
      RESULTS: We included eight reports exploring the quality of reporting of network 
      meta-analyses. From past reviews, authors found several aspects of network 
      meta-analyses were inadequately reported, including primary information about 
      literature searching, study selection, and risk of bias evaluations; statement of 
      the underlying assumptions for network meta-analysis, as well as efforts to verify 
      their validity; details of statistical models used for analyses (including 
      information for both Bayesian and Frequentist approaches); completeness of reporting 
      of findings; and approaches for summarizing probability measures as additional 
      important considerations. CONCLUSIONS: While few studies were identified, several 
      deficiencies in the current reporting of network meta-analyses were observed. These 
      findings reinforce the need to develop reporting guidance for network meta-analyses. 
      Findings from this review will be used to guide next steps in the development of 
      reporting guidance for network meta-analysis in the format of an extension of the 
      PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) 
      Statement.

TI  - Dyspnea and reversibility profile of P2Y₁₂ antagonists: systematic review of new 
      antiplatelet drugs.
PG  - 303-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dyspnea has been consecutively reported in some trials evaluating new 
      P2Y₁₂ inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review and quantify the global risk of 
      dyspnea of recent P2Y₁₂ inhibitor drugs, and evaluate its association with the 
      reversibility profile of P2Y₁₂ inhibitors. METHODS: A database search (March 2013) 
      retrieved randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing new antiplatelet drugs 
      (ticagrelor, prasugrel, cangrelor, elinogrel) with clopidogrel. The primary outcome 
      was the incidence of dyspnea. Placebo-controlled trials were excluded. Meta-analysis 
      was performed and estimates were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence 
      intervals (95% CIs). Dyspnea incidence was evaluated according to the reversibility 
      profile of P2Y₁₂ antagonists. RESULTS: We found eight RCTs including 41,289 
      patients. Prasugrel was not associated with an increased risk of dyspnea (RR 1.09, 
      95% CI 0.93-1.27), whereas ticagrelor (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.37-2.77), cangrelor (RR 
      2.42, 95% CI 1.36-4.33), and elinogrel (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.57-6.72) showed an 
      increased risk of dyspnea. Reversible inhibitors significantly increased the risk of 
      dyspnea compared with the irreversible inhibitor, prasugrel, through adjusted 
      indirect comparison (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.40-2.82). CONCLUSIONS: The reversible P2Y₁₂ 
      antagonists ticagrelor, cangrelor, and elinogrel have an increased incidence of 
      dyspnea in increasing order when compared with irreversible P2Y₁₂ inhibitors such as 
      clopidogrel or prasugrel.

AB  - Background. We wanted to verify retrospectively the proportion of patients with 
      psoriatic arthritis who were in remission after 1 year of continuous therapy with 
      either etanercept or adalimumab. Remission was defined as the absence of both 
      clinical and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) findings suggestive of joint 
      inflammation. Patients and Methods. The data of twenty-five patients with psoriatic 
      arthritis were available for the clinical and CEUS evaluations before and after 1 
      year of continuous therapy with etanercept or adalimumab. The count of swollen 
      (ACR66), tender (ACR68), and active inflamed joints (AJC) was used to measure the 
      severity of joint involvement. PASI was used to score the severity of psoriasis. 
      HAQ, DLQI, VAS pain, and VAS itching were administered to each patient before 
      starting therapy and every 3 months, up to 1 year. Results. Eight (32%) out of 
      twenty-five patients were in remission after 1 year of therapy with etanercept or 
      adalimumab. A significant reduction of all clinical variables analysed was seen 
      during the course of therapy. Conclusion. Although a significant proportion of 
      patients achieved remission of arthritis after 1 year of effective anti-TNF therapy, 
      the majority of them continued to have either clinical or CEUS findings suggestive 
      of persistence of joint inflammation.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analyses in multiple sclerosis: a review of modelling approaches.
PG  - 559-72
LID - 10.1007/s40273-014-0150-1 [doi]
AB  - The growing number of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for patients with multiple 
      sclerosis (MS) and the high acquisition costs of these DMTs are likely to increase 
      the demand for information on their cost effectiveness. To improve the comparability 
      and applicability of the findings from future cost-effectiveness analyses, it would 
      be useful to have a clear understanding of the methodological challenges of 
      modelling the cost effectiveness of DMTs in MS and the different approaches taken by 
      such studies to date. In contrast to previous review studies, this review focuses on 
      long-term time horizon (≥10 years) simulation-based cost-effectiveness analyses with 
      homogeneous contexts of analysis (i.e. those with similar study objectives, 
      comparators, and target populations) published over the past decade. By doing so, it 
      provides a clearer picture of how modelling approaches taken in the existing studies 
      truly differ across studies, and reveals major areas for improvement in conducting 
      future cost-effectiveness analyses of DMTs for patients with MS.

TI  - Analgesic efficacy of opioids in chronic pain: recent meta-analyses.
PG  - 324-33
LID - 10.1111/bph.12634 [doi]
AB  - Opioids are regularly administered in acute and cancer pain. In chronic non-cancer 
      pain (CNCP), however, their use is controversial. Previous meta-analyses and 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) lack methodological homogeneity and comparable 
      data. Here we analysed the maximum analgesic efficacies of opioids and non-opioids 
      compared with placebo, and of physiotherapy and psychotherapy compared with active 
      or waiting-list controls. We screened 3647 citations and included RCTs if treatment 
      duration was at least 3 weeks, data were sufficient for meta-analysis, and criteria 
      for high quality were met. Only 46 studies (10 742 patients) met the criteria. 
      Weighted and standardized mean differences (WMD, SMD) between pain intensities were 
      pooled to conduct separate meta-analyses for each treatment category. At the end of 
      treatment the WMD for pain reduction (100-point scale) was 12.0 for 'strong' 
      opioids, 10.6 for 'weak' opioids, 8.4 for non-opioids (each vs. placebo), 5.5 for 
      psychotherapy and 4.5 for physiotherapy (each vs. active controls). Dropout rates 
      were high in pharmacological studies. The 95% confidence intervals using the 
      outcomes of control groups did not indicate statistical differences between 
      efficacies of the five interventions. Because not enough eligible head-to-head 
      trials were available, our analysis is limited to adjusted indirect comparisons. The 
      heterogeneity of pre-post pain differences in control groups did not allow the 
      definition of a common comparator. In conclusion, although there were statistically 
      significant differences between maximum treatment efficacies, no intervention per se 
      produced clinically important improvements in average pain intensity. Thus, opioids 
      alone are inappropriate and multimodal treatment programmes may be required for 
      CNCP. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Opioids: New

AB  - Despite the great realized or potential value of network meta-analysis of randomized 
      controlled trial evidence to inform health care decision making, many decision 
      makers might not be familiar with these techniques. The Task Force developed a 
      consensus-based 26-item questionnaire to help decision makers assess the relevance 
      and credibility of indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis to help 
      inform health care decision making. The relevance domain of the questionnaire (4 
      questions) calls for assessments about the applicability of network meta-analysis 
      results to the setting of interest to the decision maker. The remaining 22 questions 
      belong to an overall credibility domain and pertain to assessments about whether the 
      network meta-analysis results provide a valid answer to the question they are 
      designed to answer by examining 1) the used evidence base, 2) analysis methods, 3) 
      reporting quality and transparency, 4) interpretation of findings, and 5) conflicts 
      of interest. The questionnaire aims to help readers of network meta-analysis opine 
      about their confidence in the credibility and applicability of the results of a 
      network meta-analysis, and help make decision makers aware of the subtleties 
      involved in the analysis of networks of randomized trial evidence. It is anticipated 
      that user feedback will permit periodic evaluation and modification of the 
      questionnaire.

TI  - Systematic evidence synthesis of treatments for ADHD in children and adolescents: 
      indirect treatment comparisons of lisdexamfetamine with methylphenidate and 
      atomoxetine.
PG  - 1673-85
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2014.904772 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Systematically review and synthesize the clinical evidence of treatments 
      for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by indirectly comparing 
      established treatments in the UK with a drug recently approved in Europe 
      (lisdexamfetamine [LDX]). POPULATION: children and adolescents. SETTING: Europe. 
      Comparators: methylphenidate (MPH), atomoxetine (ATX), and dexamphetamine (DEX). 
      Electronic databases and relevant conference proceedings were searched for 
      randomized, controlled clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety of at least 
      one of the comparators and LDX. Quality assessments for each included trial were 
      performed using criteria recommended by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. 
      Network meta-analysis methods for dichotomous outcomes were employed to evaluate 
      treatment efficacy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response, as defined by either a 
      reduction from baseline of at least 25% in the ADHD Rating Scale [ADHD-RS] total 
      score or, separately, as assessed on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement 
      [CGI-I] scale, and safety (all-cause withdrawals and withdrawal due to adverse 
      events). RESULTS: The systematic review found 32 trials for the meta-analysis, 
      including data on LDX, ATX, and different formulations of MPH. No trials for DEX 
      meeting the inclusion criteria were found. Sufficient data were identified for each 
      outcome: ADHD-RS, 16 trials; CGI-I, 20 trials; all-cause withdrawals, 28 trials; and 
      withdrawals due to adverse events, 27 trials. The relative probability of treatment 
      response for CGI-I (95% confidence intervals [CI]) for ATX versus LDX was 0.65 
      (0.53-0.78); for long-acting MPH versus LDX, 0.82 (0.69-0.97); for intermediate 
      release MPH versus LDX, 0.51 (0.40-0.65); and for short-acting MPH versus LDX, 0.62 
      (0.51-0.76). The relative probabilities of ADHD-RS treatment response also favored 
      LDX. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of ADHD, the synthesis of efficacy data showed 
      statistically significant better probabilities of response with LDX than for 
      formulations of MPH or ATX. The analysis of safety data proved inconclusive due to 
      low event rates. These results may be limited by the studies included, which only 
      investigated the short-term efficacy of medications in patients without comorbid 
      disorders.

TI  - Comparative coronary risks of apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran: a meta-analysis 
      and adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 707-17
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12376 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: There are concerns regarding increased risk of acute coronary syndrome with 
      dabigatran. We aimed to assess whether alternative treatment options such as 
      rivaroxaban or apixaban carry a similar risk as compared with dabigatran. METHODS: 
      We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials of apixaban, 
      dabigatran or rivaroxaban against control (placebo, heparin or vitamin K 
      antagonist). We pooled odds ratios (OR) for adverse coronary events (acute coronary 
      syndrome or myocardial infarction) using fixed effect meta-analysis and assessed 
      heterogeneity with I(2) . We conducted adjusted indirect comparisons to compare risk 
      of adverse coronary events with apixaban or rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Dabigatran was 
      associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse coronary events in pooled 
      analysis of nine trials (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.14, 1.86). There was no signal for 
      coronary risk with apixaban from nine trials (pooled OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or 
      rivaroxaban from nine trials (pooled OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72, 0.93). Overall, adjusted 
      indirect comparison suggested that both apixaban (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44, 0.85) and 
      rivaroxaban (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.39, 0.76) were associated with lower coronary risk 
      than dabigatran. Restricting the indirect comparison to a vitamin K antagonist as a 
      common control, yielded similar findings, OR 0.57 (95% CI 0.39, 0.85) for apixaban 
      vs. dabigatran and 0.53 (95% CI 0.37, 0.77) for rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the comparative safety of 
      apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran with regards to acute coronary adverse events.

TI  - What drives the comparative effectiveness of biologics vs. methotrexate in 
      rheumatoid arthritis? Meta-regression and graphical inspection of suspected clinical 
      factors.
PG  - 1264-73
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/ket492 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore which clinical factors and patient 
      characteristics are associated with the magnitude of comparative efficacy between 
      biologics vs. MTX in RA patients with inadequate response to MTX. METHODS: We 
      included randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of a biologic plus MTX 
      vs. MTX alone. We examined several clinical factors and patient characteristics 
      potentially associated with magnitude of response, measured as ACR20 (20% 
      improvement in ACR criteria) and ACR50 (16-26 weeks). We employed meta-regression 
      for formal estimates and statistical significance of effect modification. We 
      produced regression and forest plots to further inspect potential associations. 
      RESULTS: For ACR50, a 1-year increment on the average patient disease duration was 
      statistically significantly associated with a 16% relative increase in the pooled 
      odds ratio (OR) estimate (P = 0.003). A 1-year increment in patient age and a 1 
      mg/week increment in MTX dose were marginally statistically significantly associated 
      with a 9% (P = 0.056) and 22% (P = 0.092) relative increase in the OR. For ACR20, 
      the average number of swollen and tender joints was marginally statistically 
      associated with a 3% relative decrease. The associations for age and MTX dose 
      appeared to be partly driven by significant negative associations between these two 
      factors and the control group response. CONCLUSION: Our analyses identified key 
      variables associated with the magnitude of comparative effects for ACR outcomes. Our 
      findings provide valuable insights for future trial designs and systematic reviews 
      as well as decision-making and clinical practice.

TI  - Concomitant chemoradiotherapy versus altered fractionation radiotherapy in the 
      radiotherapeutic management of locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell 
      carcinoma: An adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis.
PG  - 670-6
LID - 10.1002/hed.23661 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment intensification by using chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or altered 
      fractionation radiotherapy (RT) improves outcomes in locoregionally advanced head 
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: Two comprehensive meta-analyses 
      with similar control arms (conventionally fractionated RT) were compared indirectly. 
      RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) of death with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
      overall comparison of altered fractionation RT with concomitant CRT was 1.13 (95% 
      CI, 0.97-1.29; p = .07) suggesting no significant difference between both 
      approaches. Compared to concomitant CRT, the HR for death was 1.01 (95% CI, 
      0.89-1.15; p = .82); 1.22 (95% CI, 0.94-1.59; p = .13); and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.07-1.39; 
      p = .002) for hyperfractionated RT; accelerated RT without total dose reduction; and 
      accelerated RT with total dose reduction, respectively. CONCLUSION: Concomitant CRT 
      and hyperfractionated RT are comparable to one another on indirect comparison in the 
      radiotherapeutic management of locoregionally advanced HNSCC. Any form of 
      acceleration (with or without total dose reduction) may not compensate fully for 
      lack of chemotherapy.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of different kinds of laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a 
      network meta analysis of 43 randomized controlled trials.
PG  - e90313
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0090313 [doi]
LID - e90313
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We conducted a network meta analysis (NMA) to compare 
      different kinds of laparoscopic cholecystectomy [LC] (single port [SPLC], two ports 
      [2PLC], three ports [3PLC], and four ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy [4PLC], and 
      four ports mini-laparoscopic cholecystectomy [mini-4PLC]). METHODS: PubMed, the 
      Cochrane library, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched to find randomized 
      controlled trials [RCTs]. Direct pair-wise meta analysis (DMA), indirect treatment 
      comparison meta analysis (ITC) and NMA were conducted to compare different kinds of 
      LC. RESULTS: We included 43 RCTs. The risk of bias of included studies was high. DMA 
      showed that SPLC was associated with more postoperative complications, longer 
      operative time, and higher cosmetic score than 4PLC, longer operative time and 
      higher cosmetic score than 3PLC, more postoperative complications than mini-4PLC. 
      Mini-4PLC was associated with longer operative time than 4PLC. ITC showed that 3PLC 
      was associated with shorter operative time than mini-4PLC, and lower postoperative 
      pain level than 2PLC. 2PLC was associated with fewer postoperative complications and 
      longer hospital stay than SPLC. NMA showed that SPLC was associated with more 
      postoperative complications than mini-4PLC, and longer operative time than 4PLC. 
      CONCLUSION: The rank probability plot suggested 4PLC might be the worst due to the 
      highest level of postoperative pain, longest hospital stay, and lowest level of 
      cosmetic score. The best one might be mini-4PLC because of highest level of cosmetic 
      score, and fewest postoperative complications, or SPLC because of lowest level of 
      postoperative pain and shortest hospital stay. But more studies are needed to 
      determine which will be better between mini-4PLC and SPLC.

TI  - Chemotherapy for patients with gastric cancer after complete resection: a network 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 584-92
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i2.584 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To conduct a network meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of different 
      chemotherapy regimens for patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: PubMed 
      (1966-2011.12), the Cochrane Library (2011 Issue 2) and EMBASE (1974-2011.12) were 
      searched with the terms "gastric cancer" and "chemotherapy", as well as the medical 
      subject headings. References from relevant articles and conferences were also 
      included. Patients who had previous gastric surgery, radiation before or after 
      surgery or chemotherapy before surgery were excluded. In this study, only randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) were considered, and the end-point was the overall 
      mortality. Direct comparisons were performed using traditional meta-analysis whereas 
      indirect comparisons were performed using network meta-analysis. RESULTS: In total, 
      31 RCTs with 7120 patients were included. Five chemotherapy regimens, fluorouracil 
      (FU) + BCNU, FU + methyl-CCNU (mCCNU), FU + cisplatin, FU + anthracyclines and FU + 
      mitomycin c (MMC) + cytarabine (Ara-c), were found to be less beneficial in terms of 
      overall mortality. In contrast, four chemotherapy regimens were effective for the 
      patients after surgery, including FU + MMC + adriamycin (FMA), FU + MMC (FM), 
      Tegafur and MMC, There was no significant difference in terms of overall mortality 
      among these regimens. The evidence for the FM regimen and MMC regimen was poor. 
      Additionally, the FMA regimen, which includes a variety of chemotherapy drugs and 
      causes many side effects, was not better than the Tegafur regimen. CONCLUSION: 
      Although the four chemotherapy regimens were effective in patients with gastric 
      cancer after surgery and the overall mortality revealed no significant difference 
      among them in the network meta-analysis, thorough analysis of the results recommends 
      Tegafur as the first-line adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients after complete 
      resection.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus other new oral anticoagulants for stroke 
      prevention in atrial fibrillation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apixaban (5 mg BID), dabigatran (available as 150 mg and 110 mg BID in 
      Europe), and rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) are 3 novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) 
      currently approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). 
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
      apixaban against other NOACs from the perspective of the United Kingdom National 
      Health Services. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the 
      pharmacoeconomic impact of apixaban versus other NOACs over a lifetime. Pair-wise 
      indirect treatment comparisons were conducted against other NOACs by using ARISTOTLE 
      (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial 
      Fibrillation), RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy), 
      and ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With 
      Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial 
      Fibrillation) trial results for the following end points: ischemic stroke, 
      hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant 
      nonmajor bleeds, myocardial infarction, and treatment discontinuations. Outcomes 
      were life-years, quality-adjusted life years gained, direct health care costs, and 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Apixaban was projected to increase 
      life expectancy versus other NOACs, including dabigatran (both doses) and 
      rivaroxaban. A small increase in therapeutic management costs was observed with 
      apixaban due to projected gains in life expectancy and lower discontinuation rates 
      anticipated on apixaban versus other NOACs through lifetime. The estimated 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £9611, £4497, and £5305 per 
      quality-adjusted life-year gained with apixaban compared with dabigatran 150 mg BID, 
      dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, respectively. Sensitivity 
      analyses indicated that results were robust over a wide range of inputs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although our analysis was limited by the absence of head-to-head 
      trials, based on the indirect comparison data available, our model projects that 
      apixaban may be a cost-effective alternative to dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran 
      110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for stroke prevention in AF patients 
      from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Services.

TI  - Meta-analysis of postoperative morbidity and perioperative mortality in patients 
      receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for resectable oesophageal 
      and gastro-oesophageal junctional cancers.
PG  - 321-38
LID - 10.1002/bjs.9418 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term survival benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and 
      chemoradiotherapy (NACR) for oesophageal carcinoma are well established. Both are 
      burdened, however, by toxicity that could contribute to perioperative morbidity and 
      mortality. METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and Embase were searched to 
      capture the incidence of any postoperative complications, cardiac complications, 
      respiratory complications, anastomotic leakage, postoperative 30-day mortality, 
      total postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality in randomized clinical 
      trials comparing NAC or NACR with surgery alone, or NAC versus NACR. Meta-analyses 
      comparing NAC and NACR were conducted by using adjusted indirect comparison. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-three relevant studies were identified. Comparing NAC or NACR with 
      surgery alone, there was no increase in morbidity or mortality attributable to 
      neoadjuvant therapy. Subgroup analysis of NACR for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
      suggested an increased risk of total postoperative mortality and treatment-related 
      mortality compared with surgery alone: risk ratio 1·95 (95 per cent confidence 
      interval 1·06 to 3·60; P = 0·032) and 1·97 (1·07 to 3·64; P = 0·030) respectively. A 
      combination of direct comparison and adjusted indirect comparison showed no 
      difference between NACR and NAC regarding morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION: 
      Neither NAC nor NACR for oesophageal carcinoma increases the risk of postoperative 
      morbidity or perioperative mortality compared with surgery alone. There was no clear 
      difference between NAC and NACR. Care should be taken with NACR in oesophageal SCC, 
      where an increased risk of postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality 
      was apparent.

      comparison meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of adalimumab and infliximab for the treatment of 
      moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using indirect treatment comparison 
      meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic review and Bayesian indirect treatment 
      comparison meta-analyses were performed for seven patient-important clinical 
      outcomes at 8 weeks and 52 weeks. Odds ratio (OR) estimates and associated 95% 
      credible intervals (CrIs) were produced. RESULTS: Five eligible RCTs informed 
      clinical remission, response, mucosal healing, quality of life, colectomy, serious 
      adverse events, and discontinuation due to adverse events at 8 weeks and 52 weeks. 
      At 8 weeks of induction therapy, clinical remission (OR=0.42, 95% CrI 0.17-0.97), 
      clinical response (OR=0.45, 95% CrI 0.23-0.89) and mucosal healing (OR=0.46, 95% CrI 
      0.25-0.86) statistically favored infliximab. However, after 52 weeks of maintenance 
      therapy OR estimates showed no significant difference between infliximab and 
      adalimumab. For serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, 
      adalimumab and infliximab were similar to placebo. Further, the indirect treatment 
      comparison of adalimumab and infliximab yielded odds ratios close to 1.00 with wide 
      credible intervals. CONCLUSION: The findings of this indirect treatment comparison 
      meta-analysis suggest that both infliximab and adalimumab are superior to placebo in 
      the treatment of moderate to moderately severe ulcerative colitis. While infliximab 
      is statistically more effective than adalimumab in the induction of remission, 
      response and mucosal healing at 8 weeks, infliximab and adalimumab are comparable in 
      efficacy at 52 weeks of maintenance treatment.

TI  - Indirect treatment comparison between fixed-dose-combinations of amlodipine/losartan 
      and amlodipine/valsartan in blood pressure control.
PG  - 163-72
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.12343 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study compared blood pressure (BP) changes after 8 weeks of therapy 
      between a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of amlodipine/losartan and 
      amlodipine/valsartan using a network meta-analysis because no trials directly 
      compared amlodipine/losartan with other FDCs. METHODS: A systematic search 
      identified six randomised controlled trials (amlodipine/losartan-3, 
      amlodipine/valsartan-3) of FDCs and their component monotherapies. Conventional 
      fixed-effects methods were used to conduct the comparisons. The primary and 
      secondary effect measures were the changes in sitting diastolic and systolic blood 
      pressure (sitDBP, sitSBP) at 8 weeks post-randomisation. RESULTS: The estimated 
      amlodipine/valsartan - amlodipine/losartan difference (95% confidence interval) in 
      sitDBP reduction was -1.27 mmHg, (-5.7, 2.2) for lower dosages and -0.45 mmHg, 
      (-3.7, 2.7) for higher dosages; for sitSBP, the values were -3.74 mmHg, (-9.0, 2.9) 
      for lower dosages and 0.2 mmHg, (-6.2, 6.0) for higher dosages. The confidence of a 
      greater reduction in BP (fixed difference = 0) on amlodipine/losartan 5/50 than on 
      amlodipine/valsartan 5/80 was 77% for sitDBP and 89% for sitSBP. The corresponding 
      confidence for the higher doses was 61% for sitDBP and 48% for sitSBP. The findings 
      support asserting with (fixed) 95% confidence that the BP reduction on 
      amlodipine/valsartan 5/80 exceeds the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 reduction by at most 
      1.6 mmHg for sitDBP, and at most 1.26 mmHg for sitSBP. The corresponding upper 
      bounds for the higher dosages were 2.31 mmHg (sitDBP) and 5.38 mmHg (sitSBP). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The BP lowering effect with amlodipine/losartan and 
      amlodipine/valsartan was comparable. Potential superiority of the reductions 
      realised with amlodipine/valsartan relative to amlodipine/losartan, are unlikely to 
      be clinically material.

TI  - Everolimus and sunitinib for advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/2162-3619-2-32 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus and sunitinib have been approved for the treatment advanced 
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, but have not been compared to each other in a 
      randomized trial and have not demonstrated prolonged overall survival compared to 
      placebo. This study aimed to indirectly compare overall and progression-free among 
      everolimus, sunitinib and placebo across separate randomized trials. METHODS: A 
      matching adjusted indirect comparison was conducted in which individual patient data 
      from the pivotal trial of everolimus (n = 410) were adjusted to match the inclusion 
      criteria and average baseline characteristics reported for the pivotal trial of 
      sunitinib (n = 171). Prior to matching, trial populations differed in baseline 
      performance status and prior treatments. After matching, these and all other 
      available baseline characteristics were balanced between trials. RESULTS: Compared 
      to the placebo arm in the sunitinib trial, everolimus was associated with 
      significantly prolonged overall survival (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.38-0.98, 
      p = 0.042).Compared to sunitinib, everolimus was associated with similar 
      progression-free (hazard ratio for death (HR) = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.46-1.53, p = 0.578) 
      and overall survival (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.49-1.31, p = 0.383). CONCLUSION: After 
      adjusting for observed cross-trial differences, everolimus treatment was associated 
      with longer overall survival than the placebo arm in the sunitinib trial for 
      advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

TI  - Bendamustine-rituximab: a cost-utility analysis in first-line treatment of indolent 
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in England and Wales.
PG  - 111-24
LID - 10.3111/13696998.2013.873044 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bendamustine-rituximab (B-R) 
      compared with CHOP-R (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, 
      rituximab) and CVP-R (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, rituximab) as 
      first-line treatment for patients with advanced indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
      (NHL). METHODS: A patient-level simulation was adapted from the model used by the 
      University of Sheffield School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) in a health 
      technology appraisal of rituximab for first-line treatment of follicular lymphoma. 
      This approach allowed modelling of the complex treatment pathways in indolent NHL. 
      Data from a Phase 3 randomized, open-label trial were used to compare B-R with 
      CHOP-R. The relative efficacy of CHOP-R and CVP-R was estimated using an indirect 
      treatment comparison similar to the original ScHARR approach. The analysis was 
      conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales, 
      using a lifetime time horizon. A number of one-way sensitivity and scenario analyses 
      were conducted, including one using recently published data comparing CVP-R with 
      CHOP-R. RESULTS: The deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
      £5249 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for B-R vs CHOP-R, and £8092 per QALY 
      for B-R vs CVP-R. The alternative scenario using direct data comparing CVP-R with 
      CHOP-R approximately halved the ICER for B-R vs CVP-R to £4733. Owing to its better 
      toxicity profile, B-R reduced the cost of treating adverse events by over £1000 per 
      patient vs CHOP-R. LIMITATIONS: The main limitations were: immaturity of overall 
      survival data from the Phase 3 trial; reliance on quality-of-life data from previous 
      health technology appraisals (as this was not collected in the trial); and a lack of 
      direct evidence or a network of connected evidence comparing B-R with CVP-R. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The ICERs for B-R vs CHOP-R and CVP-R were considerably below the 
      thresholds normally regarded as cost-effective in England and Wales (£20,000-30,000 
      per QALY).

TI  - Aliskiren/amlodipine vs. aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide in hypertension: indirect 
      meta-analysis of trials comparing the two combinations vs. monotherapy.
PG  - 268-78
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpt210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, is effective for reducing blood 
      pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension when combined with amlodipine or 
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). However, the efficacy and tolerability of the 2 
      combinations are unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials of aliskiren/amlodpine and aliskiren/HCTZ for hypertension. METHODS: The 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Novartis 
      clinical trial database were searched through December 2012 for reports of 
      randomized controlled trials of aliskiren/amlodpine and aliskiren/HCTZ vs. 
      monotherapy in patients with hypertension. The main outcome measures were reduction 
      in systolic BP and diastolic BP from baseline and rates of therapeutic response and 
      BP control. Tolerance of aliskiren/amlodipine and aliskiren/HCTZ was also analyzed. 
      Outcomes were initially pooled by standard random-effects methods, producing a 
      weighted mean difference (WMD) or risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs). The pooled estimates were then used for adjusted indirect comparisons. 
      RESULTS: We selected 19 reports of trials involving 13,614 participants. 
      Aliskiren/amlodpine and aliskiren/HCTZ were more effective than monotherapy in 
      controlling BP. Aliskiren/amlodipine was significantly more effective than 
      aliskiren/HCTZ in reducing systolic BP (WMD = -3.36 mm Hg; 95% CI = -4.64 to 2.07 mm 
      Hg) and diastolic BP (WMD = -3.49 mm Hg; 95% CI = -4.34 to 2.63 mm Hg). As compared 
      with aliskiren/HCTZ, alikiren/amlodipine was associated with higher rate of 
      therapeutic response (RR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.14-1.33) and BP control (RR = 1.24; 95% 
      CI = 1.11-1.39). Number of adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events were 
      similar with aliskiren/amlodipine and aliskiren/HCTZ. CONCLUSIONS: BP control is 
      better with aliskiren combined with amlodipine or HCTZ than with monotherapy, with 
      aliskiren/amlodipine being more effective than aliskiren/HCTZ.

TI  - Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of erlotinib versus gefitinib in first-line

      non-small-cell lung cancer patients in Hong Kong.
PG  - 178-86

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of erlotinib versus 
      gefitinib as first-line treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor-activating 
      mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients. DESIGN. Indirect treatment 
      comparison and a cost-effectiveness assessment. SETTING: Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Those 
      having epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive non-small-cell 
      lung cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Erlotinib versus gefitinib use was compared on the basis 
      of four relevant Asian phase-III randomised controlled trials: one for erlotinib 
      (OPTIMAL) and three for gefitinib (IPASS; NEJGSG; WJTOG). The cost-effectiveness 
      assessment model simulates the transition between the health states: 
      progression-free survival, progression, and death over a lifetime horizon. The World 
      Health Organization criterion (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <3 times of 
      gross domestic product/capita: <US$102 582; approximately <HK$798 078) was used to 
      rate cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The best fit of study characteristics and 
      prognostic patient characteristics were found between the OPTIMAL and IPASS trials. 
      Comparing progression-free survival hazard ratios of erlotinib versus gefitinib 
      using only these randomised controlled trials in an indirect treatment comparison 
      resulted in a statistically significant progression-free survival difference in 
      favour of erlotinib (indirect treatment comparison hazard ratio=0.33; 95% confidence 
      interval, 0.19-0.58; P=0.0001). The cost-effectiveness assessment model showed that 
      the cost per progression-free life year gained and per quality-adjusted life year 
      gained was at acceptable values of US$39 431 (approximately HK$306 773) and US$62 
      419 (approximately HK$485 619) for erlotinib versus gefitinib, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: The indirect treatment comparison of OPTIMAL versus IPASS shows that 
      erlotinib is significantly more efficacious than gefitinib. Furthermore, the 
      cost-effectiveness assessment indicates that the incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratios are well within an acceptable range in relation to the survival benefits 
      obtained. In conclusion, erlotinib is cost-effective compared to gefitinib for 
      first-line epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive 
      non-small-cell lung cancer patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and prior stroke are classified as 
      high risk in all risk stratification schemes. A systematic review and meta-analysis 
      was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of New Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) 
      to warfarin in patients with AF and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack 
      (TIA). METHODS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including total 14527 
      patients, comparing NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban) with warfarin were 
      included in the analysis. Primary efficacy endpoint was ischemic stroke, and primary 
      safety endpoint was intracranial bleeding. Random-effects models were used to pool 
      efficacy and safety data across RCTs. RevMan and Stata software were used for direct 
      and indirect comparisons, respectively. RESULTS: In patients with AF and previous 
      stroke or TIA, effects of NOACs were not statistically different from that of 
      warfarin, in reduction of stroke (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.73- 1.01), disabling and fatal stroke (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71-1.04), and all-cause 
      mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 -1.02). Randomization to NOACs was associated with a 
      significantly lower risk of intracranial bleeding (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.25-0.70). There 
      were no major differences in efficacy between apixaban, dabigatran (110 mg BID and 
      150 mg BID) and rivaroxaban. Major bleeding was significantly lower with apixaban 
      and dabigatran (110 mg BID) compared with dabigatran (150 mg BID) and rivaroxaban. 
      CONCLUSION: NOACs may not be more effective than warfarin in the secondary 
      prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with a prior history of cerebrovascular 
      ischemia, but have a lower risk of intracranial bleeding.

TI  - β-Adrenergic receptor antagonists and fracture risk: a meta-analysis of selectivity, 
      gender, and site-specific effects.
PG  - 121-9
LID - 10.1007/s00198-013-2498-z [doi]
AB  - By meta-analysis, the risk of fracture was 15% lower in patients treated with 
      β-adrenergic blockers compared to controls independent of gender, fracture site, and 
      dose. This might be attributable to β1-selective blockers. INTRODUCTION: The aim of 
      this study is to determine by meta-analysis whether β-adrenergic blockers (BBs) 
      reduce fracture risk and whether the effect, if demonstrable, is dependent upon 
      selectivity, dose, gender, or fracture site. METHODS: A literature search was 
      performed in electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and reference sections of 
      relevant articles to identify eligible studies. Adjusted estimates of fracture risk 
      effect size (ES) were pooled across studies using fixed or random-effects (RE) 
      meta-analysis as appropriate. Dose-related effects were evaluated using 
      meta-regression. To explore the relative efficacy of β1-selective blockers in 
      comparison to nonselective BBs, adjusted indirect comparison was performed. RESULTS: 
      A total of 16 studies (7 cohort and 9 case-control studies), involving 1,644,570 
      subjects, were identified. The risk of any fracture was found to be significantly 
      reduced in subjects receiving BBs as compared to control subjects (16 studies, RE 
      pooled ES = 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.93; I(2) = 87 %). In a sensitivity analysis limited 
      to those studies deemed to be most robust, the BB effect to reduce fracture risk was 
      sustained (four studies, pooled ES = 0.79, 95% CI 0.67-0.94; I(2) = 96%). The risk 
      of a hip fracture was lower in both women and men receiving BBs (women: pooled ES = 
      0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.91; I(2) = 1% and men: pooled ES = 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.90; I(2) 
      = 0%). Similar risk reductions were found for clinical vertebral and forearm 
      fractures, although statistical significance was not reached. The reduction in risk 
      did not appear to be dose-related (test for a linear trend p value 0.150). Using 
      adjusted indirect comparisons, it was estimated that β1-selective agents were 
      significantly more effective than nonselective BBs in reducing the risk of any 
      fracture (six studies, β1-selective blockers vs. nonselective BBs: RE pooled ES = 
      0.82, 95% CI = 0.69-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the risk of 
      fracture is approximately 15% lower in patients treated with BBs compared to 
      controls independent of gender, fracture site, and dose. This risk reduction might 
      be associated with the effects of β1-selective blockers.

TI  - Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of 
      prescription opioids, including abuse-deterrent formulations, in non-cancer pain 
      management.
PG  - 79-92
LID - 10.1111/pme.12233 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to compare safety and efficacy outcomes between 
      opioids formulated with technologies designed to deter or resist tampering (i.e., 
      abuse-deterrent formulations [ADFs]) and non-ADFs for commonly prescribed opioids 
      for treatment of non-cancer pain in adults. METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane Library 
      databases were searched for opioid publications between September 1, 2001 and August 
      31, 2011, and pivotal clinical trials from all years; abstracts from key pain 
      conferences (2010-2011) were also reviewed. One hundred and ninety-one publications 
      were initially identified, 68 of which met eligibility criteria and were 
      systematically reviewed; a subset of 16 involved a placebo group (13 non-ADFs vs 
      placebo, 3 ADFs vs placebo) and reported both efficacy and safety outcomes, and were 
      included for a meta-analysis. Summary estimates of standardized difference in mean 
      change of pain intensity (DMCPI), standardized difference in sum of pain intensity 
      difference (DSPID), and odds ratios (ORs) of each adverse event (AE) were computed 
      through random-effects estimates for ADFs (and non-ADFs) vs placebo. Indirect 
      treatment comparisons were conducted to compare ADFs and non-ADFs. RESULTS: Summary 
      estimates for standardized DMCPI and for standardized DSPID indicated that ADFs and 
      non-ADFs showed significantly greater efficacy than placebo in reducing pain 
      intensity. Indirect analyses assessing the efficacy outcomes between ADFs and 
      non-ADFs indicated that they were not significantly different (standardized DMCPI 
      [0.39 {95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00-0.76}]; standardized DSPID [-0.22 {95% CI 
      -0.74 to 0.30}]). ADFs and non-ADFs both were associated with higher odds of AEs 
      than placebo. Odds ratios from indirect analyses comparing AEs for ADFs vs non-ADFs 
      were not significant (nausea, 0.87 [0.24-3.12]; vomiting, 1.54 [0.40-5.97]; 
      dizziness/vertigo, 0.61 [0.21-1.76]; headache, 1.42 [0.57-3.53]; 
      somnolence/drowsiness, 0.47 [0.09-2.58]; constipation, 0.64 [0.28-1.49]; pruritus 
      0.41 [0.05-3.51]). CONCLUSION: ADFs and non-ADFs had comparable efficacy and safety 
      profiles, while both were more efficacious than placebo in reducing pain intensity.

TI  - Long-term clinical efficacy and safety of adding cilostazol to dual antiplatelet 
      therapy for patients undergoing PCI: a meta-analysis of randomized trials with 
      adjusted indirect comparisons.
PG  - 37-49
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2013.850067 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term clinical efficacy and safety of adding cilostazol 
      to aspirin plus clopidogrel (triple antiplatelet therapy, TAT) in patients 
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and explore its role in the era 
      of new generation adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-receptor antagonists. METHODS: PUBMED, 
      EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAT versus dual antiplatelet therapy 
      (DAT), followed by a manual search. Then, a meta-analysis of RCTs comparing TAT 
      versus standard DAT in patients undergoing PCI was performed. Furthermore, indirect 
      comparisons of TAT versus new generation ADP-receptor antagonist based DAT 
      (prasugrel or ticagrelor based DAT) were undertaken, with standard DAT as a common 
      comparator. The included end-points were major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), 
      target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), death, 
      myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, bleeding and other drug adverse 
      events. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs with a total of 31,789 patients were included. Compared 
      with standard DAT (n = 2551), TAT (n = 2545) significantly reduced the incidence of 
      MACE (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.47-0.68, P < 0.00001), TLR (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.34-0.75, 
      P = 0.0006) and TVR (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.46-0.75, P < 0.0001), and did not change 
      significantly in death (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.44-1.05, P = 0.08), MI (OR: 0.80, 95% 
      CI: 0.45-1.44, P = 0.46), stent thrombosis (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.27-1.36, P = 0.23), 
      major bleeding (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 0.52-3.85, P = 0.49) and overall bleeding (OR: 
      1.16, 95% CI: 0.79-1.69, P = 0.45). Compared with prasugrel (n = 6813) or ticagrelor 
      based DAT (n = 6732), TAT (n = 2545) further reduced the incidence of MACE (OR: 
      0.80, 95% CI: 0.72-0.90, P = 0.0012; OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75-0.92, P = 0.0003, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with standard DAT, the long-term use of TAT in 
      patients with PCI gives more benefits in reducing the incidence of MACE, TLR and TVR 
      without increasing bleeding. Furthermore, it might be superior to prasugrel or 
      ticagrelor based DAT in term of MACE, which needs to be confirmed by future studies 
      with direct comparisons.

TI  - A common reference-based indirect comparison meta-analysis of intravenous valproate 
      versus intravenous phenobarbitone for convulsive status epilepticus.
PG  - 314-23
LID - 10.1684/epd.2013.0601 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare intravenous valproate (IV-VPA) with intravenous phenobarbitone 
      (IV-PB) in the treatment of established generalised convulsive status epilepticus 
      (GCSE). Efficacy and safety were estimated using a common-reference based indirect 
      comparison meta-analysis (CRBMA) methodology. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) investigating the use of IV-VPA or IV-PB versus intravenous phenytoin 
      (IV-PHT) for GCSE were identified by a systematic search of the literature. A random 
      effects model was used to estimate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs) for efficacy 
      and safety of IV-VPA or IV-PB versus IV-PHT in a standard meta-analysis. Adjusted 
      indirect comparisons were then made between VPA and PB using the obtained results. 
      RESULTS: CRBMA showed that VPA does not lead to significantly higher seizure 
      cessation (OR 1.00; 95% CI: 0.36-2.76) compared to PB, although it exhibits fewer 
      adverse effects (OR 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04-0.71). Results of this CRBMA are consistent 
      with results of a recently published head-to-head comparison of IV-VPA and IV-PB. 
      CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate superiority of IV-VPA over 
      IV-PB for the treatment of GCSE in terms of efficacy. Some direct and indirect 
      comparisons suggest that VPA has a better safety profile than PB. However, the 
      limited numbers of underpowered RCTs included in this meta-analysis are not 
      sufficient to justify a change in clinical practice. More rigorous and appropriately 
      powered RCTs are therefore required to definitively determine the efficacy and 
      tolerability of VPA for the treatment of GCSE.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of guanfacine extended release versus atomoxetine for the 
      treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: 
      applying matching-adjusted indirect comparison methodology.
PG  - 943-53
LID - 10.1007/s40263-013-0102-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: No head-to-head clinical trials have been published comparing guanfacine 
      extended release (GXR) and atomoxetine (ATX): two nonstimulants approved for the 
      treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, other study 
      designs or methods could be used to indirectly compare these two medications. 
      Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) is a recent methodology that utilizes 
      individual patient data (IPD) from clinical trials for one treatment and published 
      aggregate data from another treatment to estimate the relative efficacy of both, 
      providing rapid, reliable comparative efficacy results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      study was to compare the efficacy of GXR and ATX for the treatment of ADHD using 
      MAIC. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify ATX and 
      GXR trials published through December 2012. Studies were selected for MAIC analyses 
      on the basis of having comparable trial characteristics and study designs. Summary 
      data from selected ATX trials and IPD from selected GXR trials were used. MAIC 
      methodology ensured comparable populations: target doses for the 'base case' 
      comparison were selected on the basis of maximum effective dosage ranges from the US 
      FDA-approved product labels (GXR 0.09-0.12 mg/kg/day, ATX 1.2 mg/kg/day for children 
      and adolescents weighing ≤70 kg). Individuals from GXR trials were selected if they 
      matched inclusion/exclusion criteria from selected ATX trials; selected GXR IPD were 
      then re-weighted to match the published ATX trial mean baseline characteristics and 
      placebo outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted, examining different dosage 
      ranges and repeating the analysis in a larger number of trials, allowing for larger 
      and more heterogeneous trial populations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome 
      measure was change in ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score. RESULTS: Using 
      MAIC in the base case comparison, significantly greater reductions in mean (standard 
      error; SE) ADHD-RS-IV total scores from baseline to end of study were observed in 
      patients treated with GXR relative to ATX [-7.0 (2.2); p < 0.01]. Significantly 
      greater reductions for GXR over ATX were also demonstrated for 
      hyperactivity/impulsivity [-3.8 (1.2); p < 0.01] and inattention [-3.2 (1.3); p < 
      0.05] subscales of the ADHD-RS-IV. Similar results were observed in MAIC sensitivity 
      analyses evaluating other dosage ranges and using more heterogeneous trial 
      populations (e.g., larger randomized sample, broader subject weight range, 
      additional trials). Mean (SE) decreases in ADHD-RS-IV total scores were greater for 
      GXR relative to ATX when including IPD for those administered GXR at lower than 
      target dosage (0.075-0.090 mg/kg/day) compared with ATX at target dosage (1.2 
      mg/kg/day), with a relative improvement of -6.0 (2.7) (p < 0.05). Reductions in 
      ADHD-RS-IV total scores were also greater for GXR in another MAIC examining GXR at 
      target dosage (0.09-0.12 mg/kg/day) and a broader range of ATX dosages (including 
      three additional trials evaluating ATX ≥1.2 mg/kg/day); relative improvement for GXR 
      versus ATX administered at target dosage or higher was -7.6 (1.4) (p < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: After adjusting for difference in baseline trial characteristics using 
      MAIC, GXR appears to be more efficacious than ATX for the treatment of ADHD. Results 
      were consistent in a variety of dosage range comparisons and within increasingly 
      heterogeneous trial populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish current guidance and practice in UK on presentation of 
      indirect comparison and mixed treatment comparison analyses; to provide 
      recommendations to improve indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison reporting 
      and to identify research priorities for improved presentation. METHODS: Existing 
      institutional guidance for conducting indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison 
      alongside current practice in health technology assessment was reviewed. Reports 
      published in UK by the Health Technology Assessment programme since 1997, which 
      utilized indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison methods, were reviewed with 
      respect to the presentation of study data, statistical models and results. 
      Recommendations for presentation were developed. RESULTS: Guidance exists that 
      provide the details necessary to conduct a successful indirect comparison/mixed 
      treatment comparison analysis but recommendations on presentation are limited. Of 
      205 health technology assessment reports that contained evidence synthesis for 
      effectiveness, 19 used indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison methods. These 
      reports utilized numerous presentational formats from which the following key 
      components were identified: network table/diagram for presenting data; model 
      description to allow reproducibility; and tables, forest plots, matrix tables and 
      summary forest plots for presenting a range of results. Recommendations were 
      developed to ensure that reporting is explicit, transparent and reproducible. 
      Approaches most understandable by non-technical decision makers, and areas where 
      future research is required, are outlined. CONCLUSIONS: There is no standard 
      presentational style used in UK for reporting indirect comparison/mixed treatment 
      comparison, and the use of graphical tools is limited. Standardization of reporting 
      and innovation in graphical representation of indirect comparison/mixed treatment 
      comparison results is required.

TI  - Paclitaxel-coated balloon or primary bare nitinol stent for revascularization of 
      femoropopliteal artery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials versus uncoated balloon 
      and an adjusted indirect comparison.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The performance of paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) or primary bare 
      nitinol stent (BNS) versus uncoated balloon angioplasty (UCB) for femoropopliteal 
      artery disease and the relative efficacy and safety of PCB versus BNS are still 
      debated. METHODS: A meta-analysis of trials in which patients were randomly assigned 
      to PCB versus UCB or BNS versus UCB was performed, as well as an indirect comparison 
      of PCB versus BNS, with UCB common comparator. The primary endpoint was target 
      lesion revascularization (TLR); secondary endpoints were restenosis, death and 
      amputation. RESULTS: In total, 1464 patients were assigned to revascularization with 
      PCB versus UCB (n = 441) or BNS versus UCB (n = 1023). Treatment with PCB versus UCB 
      reduced the risk of TLR (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.29 [0.15-0.56], p 
      < 0.001) and restenosis (0.31 [0.19-0.51], p < 0.001) without affecting mortality 
      (1.05 [0.41-2.71], p = 0.92) or amputation (0.68 [0.04-10.31], p = 0.78). BNS versus 
      UCB therapy reduced the risk of TLR (0.46 [0.27-0.80], p = 0.006) and restenosis 
      (0.51 [0.34-0.77], p = 0.02) without affecting mortality (2.08 [0.93-4.66], p = 
      0.07) or amputation (0.84 [0.30-2.35], p = 0.74). The indirect comparison found no 
      difference with PCB versus BNS in the risk of TLR (0.63 [0.26-1.48] p = 0.29), 
      restenosis (0.60 [0.32-1.15], p = 0.13) death (0.50 [0.05-4.82], p = 0.55) or 
      amputation (0.80 [0.04-15.63], p = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: In atherosclerotic disease of 
      femoropopliteal artery, both PCB and BNS therapy have superior antirestenotic 
      efficacy to UCB, without safety issues. At indirect comparison, PCB and BNS may have 
      comparable antirestenotic efficacy and safety.

TI  - Relative efficacy and safety of preservative-free latanoprost (T2345) for the 
      treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension: an adjusted Indirect 
      comparison meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.
PG  - e69-75
LID - 10.1097/IJG.0b013e3182a075e6 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of preservative-free 
      latanoprost (T2345) compared with other prostaglandin analogues (PGA) for the 
      treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension by adjusted indirect 
      comparison meta-analysis. METHODS: Randomized, controlled trials evaluating PGA for 
      the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension were identified by a 
      systematic literature review in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials 
      Register (up to December 2011) databases. The effect size for each treatment and 
      heterogeneity were assessed by classical pairwise meta-analysis (direct 
      comparisons). Adjusted indirect comparisons were performed by using Bucher method. 
      The main endpoints were intraocular pressure (IOP) measured at 3 months and 
      incidence of hyperemia. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the 
      meta-analysis. No statistically significant differences in IOP at 3 months were seen 
      between T2345 and travoprost [preserved with benzalkonium chloride (BAK), 
      polyquaternium-1 or sofzia], and other BAK-preserved PGA: bimatoprost 0.03%, 
      bimatoprost 0.01%, or latanoprost. T2345 was statistically significantly superior to 
      BAK-tafluprost (mean difference: 0.47 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval, 
      [-1.52;-0.28]). The risk of hyperemia was statistically significantly lower with 
      T2345 than with all the other PGA. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons never found 
      preservative-free latanoprost (T2345) to be statistically significantly inferior to 
      the other PGA in terms of efficacy on IOP and showed statistically significant 
      superiority over BAK-tafluprost. The risk of hyperemia was statistically 
      significantly lower with T2345 than with all the other PGA.

TI  - Mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis of aspirin, warfarin, and new 
      anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Warfarin and aspirin are used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). There are inherent challenges with both treatments, including 
      variable and inconsistent benefit and increased bleeding risks. The availability of 
      new anticoagulants offers some alternatives. OBJECTIVE: A mixed treatment comparison 
      meta-analysis to evaluate direct and indirect treatment data including aspirin, 
      warfarin apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban for the prevention of 
      primary or secondary stroke in patients with AF. METHODS: A comprehensive, 
      systematic literature search was conducted to identify randomized trials comparing 
      aspirin, warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in patients with 
      AF requiring treatment for stroke prevention. Open-label and blinded designs were 
      included if they evaluated any stroke or any bleeding event. Data on stroke and 
      bleeding events were abstracted, verified, evaluated, scored, and entered into 
      Aggregate Data Drug Information System version 1.16 to generate a mixed treatment 
      comparison meta-analysis. Direct and indirect comparisons were evaluated, and we 
      looked for inconsistency in closed loop structures. Data are reported as rate ratios 
      with 95% credible intervals. In addition, we reviewed variance statistics and 
      explored variance with node-splitting models. RESULTS: Our literature search yielded 
      30 articles, 21 of which were included. All treatments except aspirin reduced the 
      risk of any stroke compared with placebo. Warfarin (0.43 [0.33-0.57]), apixaban 
      (0.37 [0.27-0.54]), dabigatran (0.34 [0.21-0.57]), rivaroxaban (0.36 [0.22-0.60]), 
      and aspirin with clopidogrel (0.73 [0.53-0.99]) were more protective than aspirin 
      alone. Warfarin and the new anticoagulants were similar in the reduction of stroke, 
      vascular death, and mortality. There was no difference in major bleeding between any 
      treatment group. There were more nonmajor bleeding events when comparing warfarin 
      and apixaban (1.83 [1.05-4.03]); no other differences between warfarin and the other 
      new anticoagulants were found. CONCLUSIONS: This mixed treatment comparison 
      meta-analysis found similarity between warfarin and the new anticoagulants with the 
      exception of one comparison, in which warfarin was associated with more non-major 
      bleeding than apixaban. Thus, the new anticoagulants are therapeutically comparable 
      when warfarin is inappropriate.

AB  - Indirect treatment comparison (ITC) and multiple treatment comparison (MTC) 
      meta-analyses are increasingly being used to estimate the comparative effectiveness 
      of interventions when head-to-head data do not exist. ITC meta-analyses can be 
      conducted using simple methodology to compare two interventions. MTC meta-analyses 
      can be conducted using more complex methodology, often employing Bayesian 
      approaches, to compare multiple interventions. As the number of ITC and MTC 
      meta-analyses increase, it is common to find multiple analyses evaluating the same 
      interventions in similar therapeutic areas. Depending on the choice of the 
      methodological approach, the conclusions about relative treatment efficacy may 
      differ. Such situations create uncertainty for decision makers. An illustration of 
      this is provided by four ITC and MTC meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of 
      boceprevir and telaprevir for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. This paper 
      examines why these evaluations provide discordant results by examining specific 
      methodological issues that can strengthen or weaken inferences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy of different adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for stage 
      II-III gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy in Asian patients. METHODS: Associated 
      literatures were searched through electronic databases and hand-searching. 
      Prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing adjuvant chemotherapy after 
      D2 gastrectomy with surgery alone were included in the study. Overall survival and 
      disease-free survival were chosen as the endpoints. Relative hazard was analyzed by 
      Bucher adjusted indirect comparison. RESULTS: Two RCTs were selected, including 
      comparison between S-1 versus surgery alone and comparison between XELOX versus 
      surgery alone. There was no statistical difference in overall survival between the 
      two regimens (HR=0.94, 95%CI:0.62-1.44, P=0.79). The recurrence risk of S-1 was 
      slightly higher as compared to XELOX, but no statistical difference was found 
      (HR=1.11, 95%CI:0.80-1.53, P=0.54). CONCLUSION: The adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 
      is similar to XELOX for stage II-III gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy in Asian 
      patients.

TI  - Indirect comparison of randomised controlled trials: comparative efficacy of 
      dexlansoprazole vs. esomeprazole in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux 
      disease.
PG  - 190-201
LID - 10.1111/apt.12349 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dexlansoprazole is a new proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with a dual 
      delayed-release system. Both dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole are an enantiomer of 
      lansoprazole and omeprazole respectively. However, there is no head-to-head trial 
      data or indirect comparison analyses between dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole. AIM: 
      To compare the efficacy of dexlansoprazole with esomeprazole in healing erosive 
      oesophagitis (EO), the maintenance of healed EO and the treatment of non-erosive 
      reflux disease (NERD). METHODS: Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing 
      dexlansoprazole or esomeprazole with either placebo or another PPI were 
      systematically reviewed. Random-effect meta-analyses and adjusted indirect 
      comparisons were conducted to compare the treatment effect of dexlansoprazole and 
      esomeprazole using a common comparator. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: The indirect comparisons revealed 
      significant differences in symptom control of heartburn in patients with NERD at 4 
      weeks. Dexlansoprazole 30 mg was more effective than esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg 
      (RR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.15-3.51; RR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.39-3.38). However, there were no 
      statistically significant differences between the two drugs in EO healing and 
      maintenance of healed EO. Comparison of symptom control in healed EO was not able to 
      be made due to different definitions used in the RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted 
      indirect comparisons based on currently available RCT data suggested significantly 
      better treatment effect in symptom control of heartburn in patients with NERD for 
      dexlansoprazole against esomeprazole. No statistically significant differences were 
      found in other EO outcomes. However, these study findings need to be interpreted 
      with caution due to small number of studies and other limitations.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of oral pharmaceuticals for the treatment of chronic peripheral 
      neuropathic pain: meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparisons.
PG  - 706-19
LID - 10.1111/pme.12091 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neuropathic pain is generally chronic and challenging to treat. Studies 
      often ignore chronicity by reporting short-duration outcomes and fail to account for 
      medication tolerability. We assessed efficacy of oral medications on chronic 
      peripheral neuropathic pain. METHODS: Relevant published, English-language, 
      randomized controlled trials administering oral medications for peripheral 
      neuropathic pain were identified through MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 1, 2012), EMBASE (1980 
      to December 2012), the Cochrane Library Databases (through December 2012), and the 
      Oxford Pain Relief Database (through 2012). Included studies reported end point pain 
      or pain reduction from baseline on an 11-point scale (0-10); had active 
      treatment ≥ 12 weeks; reported an intention-to-treat analysis, and had 5-point 
      quality score ≥ 3. Abstracted information included patient characteristics, 
      neuropathic pain condition, drug and dosage arms, adverse events rates causing 
      dropout, and secondary measures (50% pain improvement, global improvement, and sleep 
      interference). Primary outcome meta-analysis, stratified by drug and dosage, was 
      followed by an indirect treatment comparison adjusting for study dropouts due to 
      adverse events. RESULTS: Seventeen studies comprised of 5,975 subjects, totaling 38 
      active trial arms evaluating 7 drugs, and 17 drug-dosing combinations met inclusion 
      criteria. Mean pain reduction over placebo ranked highest for duloxetine 120 mg 
      (1.17 95% CI 0.77, 1.58) and pregabalin 600 mg (1.11 95% CI 0.77, 1.45). The 
      Indirect treatment comparison showed largest effect size for duloxetine at 120 and 
      60 mg followed by pregabalin 600 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Pregabalin and duloxetine had the 
      largest beneficial effects for chronic peripheral neuropathic pain. In the absence 
      of head-to-head trials, meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparisons inform best 
      practice clinical decision-making.

TI  - Lipophilic versus hydrophilic statin therapy for heart failure: a protocol for an 
      adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/2046-4053-2-22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins are known to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in 
      primary and secondary prevention studies. Subsequently, a number of nonrandomised 
      studies have shown statins improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure 
      (HF). Small randomised controlled trials (RCT) also show improved cardiac function, 
      reduced inflammation and mortality with statins in HF. However, the findings of two 
      large RCTs do not support the evidence provided by previous studies and suggest 
      statins lack beneficial effects in HF. Two meta-analyses have shown statins do not 
      improve survival, whereas two others showed improved cardiac function and reduced 
      inflammation in HF. It appears lipophilic statins produce better survival and other 
      outcome benefits compared to hydrophilic statins. But the two types have not been 
      compared in direct comparison trials in HF. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis of lipophilic and hydrophilic statin therapy in 
      patients with HF. Our objectives are:1. To determine the effects of lipophilic 
      statins on (1) mortality, (2) hospitalisation for worsening HF, (3) cardiac function 
      and (4) inflammation.2. To determine the effects of hydrophilic statins on (1) 
      mortality, (2) hospitalisation for worsening HF, (3) cardiac function and (4) 
      inflammation.3. To compare the efficacy of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins on HF 
      outcomes with an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis.We will conduct an 
      electronic search of databases for RCTs that evaluate statins in patients with HF. 
      The reference lists of all identified studies will be reviewed. Two independent 
      reviewers will conduct the search. The inclusion criteria include:1. RCTs comparing 
      statins with placebo or no statin in patients with symptomatic HF.2. RCTs that 
      employed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle in data analysis.3. Symptomatic HF 
      patients of all aetiologies and on standard treatment.4. Statin of any dose as 
      intervention.5. Placebo or no statin arm as control.The exclusion criteria 
      include:1. RCTs involving cerivastatin in HF patients.2. RCTs with less than 4 weeks 
      of follow-up. DISCUSSION: We will perform an adjusted indirect comparison 
      meta-analysis of lipophilic versus hydrophilic statins in patients with HF using 
      placebo or no statin arm as common comparator.

TI  - Overview of methods for comparing the efficacies of drugs in the absence of 
      head-to-head clinical trial data.
PG  - 116-21
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12150 [doi]
AB  - In most therapeutic areas, multiple drug options are increasingly becoming 
      available, but there is often a lack of evidence from head-to-head clinical trials 
      that allows for direct comparison of the efficacy and/or safety of one drug vs. 
      another. This review provides an introduction to, and overview of, common methods 
      used for comparing drugs in the absence of head-to-head clinical trial evidence. 
      Naïve direct comparisons are in most instances inappropriate and should only be used 
      for exploratory purposes and when no other options are possible. Adjusted indirect 
      comparisons are currently the most commonly accepted method and use links through 
      one or more common comparators. Mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) use Bayesian 
      statistical models to incorporate all available data for a drug, even data that are 
      not relevant to the comparator drug. MTCs reduce uncertainty but have not yet been 
      widely accepted by researchers, nor drug regulatory and reimbursement authorities. 
      All indirect analyses are based on the same underlying assumption as meta-analyses, 
      namely that the study populations in the trials being compared are similar.

TI  - Direct and indirect comparison of the efficacy and safety of adalimumab, etanercept, 
      infliximab and golimumab in psoriatic arthritis.
PG  - 286-93
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12045 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Psoriatic arthritis is an autoimmune disease 
      characterized by chronic inflammation of the skin and joints. Anti-TNF drugs reduce 
      the severity of the disease in the long term. This study compares the efficacy and 
      safety of adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and golimumab in patients with 
      psoriatic arthritis. METHODS: Direct comparison was based on a literature search of 
      drug comparison studies, whereas indirect treatment comparison was based on phase 
      III clinical trials with biological agents, involving similar populations and 
      durations, and with the same outcome. ACR50 was taken as primary outcome for 
      comparison, whereas ACR20 and ACR70 were used as secondary outcomes. Indirect 
      comparisons were made using infliximab as the reference drug and the Bucher method. 
      In calculating δ (the maximum acceptable difference as a clinical criterion of 
      equivalence), use was made of half of the absolute risk reduction obtained in the 
      meta-analysis of the clinical trials included in the indirect comparison (ARR 32%; 
      δ: 16%). The four anti-TNF drugs were also compared in relation to the secondary 
      outcomes and adverse effects. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Reported direct and indirect 
      comparisons of the four drugs did not include golimumab, and did not yield 
      conclusive results. Four clinical trials - one for each drug studied - were 
      identified. The estimated differences for the primary outcome, ACR50, between 
      infliximab and the other drugs were adalimumab (ARR 4%, 95% CI -9·5 to 17·5), 
      etanercept (ARR 4%, 95% CI -10·5 to 18·5) and golimumab (ARR 9%, 95% CI -5·4 to 
      23·4). Likewise, there were no relevant differences between the drugs in relation to 
      the secondary efficacy outcomes, except for etanercept, which was less effective in 
      ACR70 response. For adverse reactions, there were also no significant differences 
      except for injection site, reactions which were more frequent with etanercept, with 
      a mean difference of 26% relative to infliximab. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: No 
      significant differences were found in ACR50 responses to the four drugs after 
      24 weeks. Injection-site reactions were more common with etanercept, but this was 
      insufficient to invalidate the inference that clinically the four drugs can be 
      regarded as clinically equivalent for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.

BTI - Ingenol Mebutate -- Benefit Assessment According to §35a Social Code Book V
AB  - The aim of this benefit assessment was to assess the added benefit of ingenol 
      mebutate gel (150 μg/g) for use on the face and scalp, and of ingenol mebutate gel 
      (500 μg/g) for use on the trunk and extremities in comparison with diclofenac / 
      hyaluronic acid gel (3%) as appropriate comparator therapy (ACT) in adult patients 
      with non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic (non-HK/HT) actinic keratosis. The 
      assessment was based on patient-relevant outcomes. The company did not identify any 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with direct comparisons of ingenol mebutate gel 
      and diclofenac / hyaluronic acid gel. It therefore aimed at determining the added 
      benefit on the basis of indirect comparisons. For both ingenol mebutate gel and 
      diclofenac / hyaluronic acid gel, the company identified studies comparing the 
      intervention therapy with a vehicle gel that did not contain ingenol mebutate gel or 
      diclofenac. The company assumed that the hyaluronic acid gel itself, which served as 
      vehicle in the diclofenac/hyaluronic acid studies, had an effect on actinic 
      keratosis, whereas the drug-free vehicle gel in the ingenol mebutate studies did 
      not. It therefore rejected an adjusted indirect comparison with vehicle gel as 
      intermediate comparator. Instead, it chose a method called "chaining of direct 
      comparisons" for the indirect comparison (comparison of ingenol mebutate gel versus 
      vehicle gel, vehicle gel versus hyaluronic acid gel, and hyaluronic acid gel versus 
      diclofenac / hyaluronic acid gel on the basis of the studies mentioned above). A 
      comparison of ingenol mebutate vehicle and hyaluronic acid gel conducted in RCTs 
      would have been necessary, however, to draw a valid conclusion on added benefit on 
      the basis of the method chosen by the company. The company did not identify such 
      studies. Groups with drug-free vehicle gel from different studies were compared in 
      one step of the method. This was an unadjusted indirect comparison, which rendered 
      randomization ineffective. Unadjusted indirect comparisons do not constitute a valid 
      method of analysis, however. Moreover, the company included 2 non-randomized 
      comparative studies on ingenol mebutate versus drug-free vehicle gel in the 
      assessment of the outcome "recurrence rate". The company did not identify any 
      studies with diclofenac/hyaluronic acid gel that recorded this outcome. Hence there 
      were no relevant data for the research question.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the additive action of ginger starch on the antifungal 
      activity of honey against Candida albicans (C. albicans). METHODS: C. albicans was 
      used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of four varieties of 
      Algerian honey. Lower concentrations of honey than the MIC were incubated with a set 
      of concentrations of starch and then added to media to determine the minimum 
      additive inhibitory concentration (MAIC). RESULTS: The MIC for the four varieties of 
      honey without starch against C. albicans ranged between 38% and 42% (v/v). When 
      starch was incubated with honey and then added to media, a MIC drop was noticed with 
      each variety. MAIC of the four varieties ranged between 32% honey (v/v) with 4% 
      starch and 36% honey (v/v) with 2% starch. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ginger starch 
      allows honey benefit and will constitute an alternative way against the resistance 
      to antifungal agents.

TI  - Subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy for seasonal allergic rhinitis: a 
      systematic review and indirect comparison.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe allergic rhinitis uncontrolled by pharmacotherapy can adversely 
      affect quality of life. Both subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual 
      immunotherapy (SLIT) have demonstrated effectiveness in this patient group; however, 
      it remains uncertain which route of administration is more effective. OBJECTIVES: We 
      sought to update existing systematic reviews on the clinical effectiveness of SCIT 
      and SLIT versus placebo, to undertake a systematic review of head-to-head trials, 
      and to compare the relative effectiveness of SCIT and SLIT in an adjusted indirect 
      comparison. METHODS: Standard systematic review methods aimed at minimizing bias 
      were used. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of SCIT or SLIT or 
      trials of SCIT versus SLIT were included. Meta-analysis and indirect comparison 
      meta-analysis with meta-regression were performed. RESULTS: Updated meta-analyses 
      confirmed statistically significant benefits for SCIT and SLIT compared with placebo 
      in adults and, to a lesser extent, in children. Only 1 head-to-head trial met the 
      inclusion criteria; both this and the indirect comparisons did not provide 
      conclusive results in favor of either SCIT or SLIT based on symptom-medication or 
      quality-of-life scores. There was a trend toward favoring SCIT for symptom and 
      medication scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is clear evidence of effectiveness of 
      both SCIT and SLIT, superiority of one mode of administration over the other could 
      not be consistently demonstrated through indirect comparison, and further research 
      is needed to establish the comparative effectiveness of SCIT versus SLIT.

TI  - Comparing Bayesian and frequentist approaches for multiple outcome mixed treatment 
      comparisons.
PG  - 702-14
LID - 10.1177/0272989X13481110 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bayesian statistical methods are increasingly popular as a tool for 
      meta-analysis of clinical trial data involving both direct and indirect treatment 
      comparisons. However, appropriate selection of prior distributions for unknown model 
      parameters and checking of consistency assumptions required for modeling remain 
      particularly challenging. We compared Bayesian and traditional frequentist 
      statistical methods for mixed treatment comparisons with multiple binary outcomes. 
      DATA: We searched major electronic bibliographic databases, Food and Drug 
      Administration reviews, trial registries, and research grant databases up to 
      December 2011 to find randomized studies published in English that examined drugs 
      for female urgency urinary incontinence (UI) on continence, improvement in UI, and 
      treatment discontinuation due to harm. METHODS: We describe and fit fixed and random 
      effects models in both Bayesian and frequentist statistical frameworks. In a 
      hierarchical model of 8 treatments, we separately analyze 1 safety and 2 efficacy 
      outcomes. We produce Bayesian and frequentist treatment ranks and odds ratios across 
      all drug v placebo comparisons, as well as Bayesian probabilities that each drug is 
      best overall through a weighted scoring rule that trades off efficacy and safety. 
      RESULTS: In our study, Bayesian and frequentist random effects models generally 
      suggest the same drugs as most attractive, although neither suggests any significant 
      differences between drugs. However, the Bayesian methods more consistently identify 
      one drug (propiverine) as best overall, produce interval estimates that are 
      generally better at capturing all sources of uncertainty in the data, and also 
      permit attractive "rankograms" that visually capture the probability that each drug 
      assumes each possible rank. CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian methods are more flexible and 
      their results more clinically interpretable, but they require more careful 
      development and specialized software.

TI  - Relative effects of two different enoxaparin regimens as comparators against newer 
      oral anticoagulants: meta-analysis and adjusted indirect comparison.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Two different regimens of enoxaparin (40 mg once daily or 30 mg bid) 
      have been used as control arms in trials of new oral anticoagulants. The choice of 
      enoxaparin comparator may influence the perceived relative efficacy and safety of 
      the newer agents, and we aimed to identify any significant differences between the 
      two enoxaparin regimens. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library 
      for randomized controlled trials that compared enoxaparin to oral anticoagulant 
      (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban) thromboprophylaxis in elective total knee or hip 
      arthroplasty. Total VTE and bleeding events were pooled using fixed-effects 
      meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessed with the I2 statistic. We conducted 
      adjusted indirect comparisons of bid vs once-daily enoxaparin regimes based on new 
      oral anticoagulants as common comparators. RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled 
      trials in hip and knee replacement surgery met the inclusion criteria. Adjusted 
      indirect comparison showed that bid enoxaparin was significantly more effective in 
      preventing VTE than enoxaparin once daily (relative risk [RR], 0.71; 95% CI, 
      0.61-0.83; P &lt; .00001). For major and clinically relevant hemorrhage, adjusted 
      indirect comparison showed that enoxaparin bid was nonsignificantly associated with 
      increased risk of bleeding (RR 1.27; 95% CI, 0.97-1.65; P = .08) above that of 
      enoxaparin once daily. Subgroup analysis limited to total knee arthroplasty trials 
      showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The use of once-daily enoxaparin regimen as 
      control in clinical trials will lead to more favorable estimates of relative 
      efficacy for the new oral anticoagulants than if enoxaparin 30 mg bid had been 
      chosen as a comparator.

BTI - Case Study Comparing Bayesian and Frequentist Approaches for Multiple Treatment 
      Comparisons
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bayesian statistical methods are increasingly popular as a tool for 
      meta-analysis of clinical trial data involving both direct and indirect treatment 
      comparisons. However, appropriate selection of prior distributions for unknown model 
      parameters and checking of consistency assumptions required for feasible modeling 
      remain particularly challenging. We compared Bayesian and traditional frequentist 
      statistical methods for multiple treatment comparisons in the context of 
      pharmacological treatments for female urinary incontinence (UI). DATA SOURCES: We 
      searched major electronic bibliographic databases, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      reviews, trial registries, and research grant databases up to November 2011 to find 
      randomized studies published in English that examined drugs for urgency UI on 
      continence, improvements in UI, and treatment discontinuation due to harms. REVIEW 
      METHODS: We fitted fixed and random effects models in frequentist and Bayesian 
      frameworks. In a hierarchical model of eight treatments, we separately analyzed one 
      safety and two efficacy outcomes. We produced Bayesian and frequentist treatment 
      ranks and odds ratios (and associated measures of uncertainty) across all bivariate 
      treatment comparisons. We also calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) to 
      achieve continence or avoid harms from pooled absolute risk differences. RESULTS: 
      While frequentist and Bayesian analyses produced broadly comparable odds ratios of 
      safety and efficacy, the Bayesian method's ability to deliver the probability that 
      any treatment is best, or among the top two such treatments, offered a more 
      meaningful clinical interpretation. In our study, two drugs emerged as attractive 
      because while neither had any significant chance of being among the least safe 
      drugs, both had greater than 50 percent chances of being among the top three drugs 
      in terms of Best12 probability for one of the efficacy endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Bayesian methods are more flexible and their results more clinically interpretable 
      but require more careful development and specialized software. KEY MESSAGES: Both 
      Bayesian and frequentist hierarchical models can be effective in multiple treatment 
      comparisons. Bayesian models sensibly shrink estimates towards each other, 
      encouraging more borrowing of statistical strength from the entire collection of 
      studies. Bayesian methods also lead to more clinically interpretable results 
      (through their ability to assign probabilities to events), as well as more sensible 
      rankings of the pharmacological treatments as compared to traditional NNT-based 
      methods. Further development of hierarchical Bayesian multiple treatment comparison 
      methods is warranted, especially for nonbinary data models, simultaneous 
      decisionmaking across multiple endpoints, assessing consistency, and incorporating 
      data sources of varying quality (e.g., clinical vs. observational data).

TI  - Biological treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis: indirect comparison.
PG  - 121-30
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12044 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease for which there is 
      an increasing range of treatment options. Biological agents (ustekinumab, 
      adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept) are indicated for moderate-to-severe 
      plaque-type psoriasis in adults who fail to respond to, have a contraindication to, 
      or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including cyclosporine, methotrexate 
      and PUVA Unfortunately, with new drugs, the pivotal trials leading to their 
      licensing are often placebo-controlled trials rather than comparative trials vs. 
      established therapies. Therefore, inference on comparative effectiveness of the 
      newer agents must be derived indirectly, through estimation of effects of the new 
      agents vs. a common comparator. The objective of this study is to compare the 
      relative efficacy of the biological agents through a systematic review of the 
      indirect clinical trial evidence. METHODS: A systematic literature search was 
      performed for clinical trials of biological agents in psoriasis. Pivotal, 
      randomized, double-blind, controlled (placebo) trials using intention-to-treat 
      analysis were selected for detailed analysis. Trials must include PASI 75 as a 
      primary end point. The indirect comparison was performed using the method of Bucher 
      adjusted with the ITC calculator (Indirect Treatment Comparisons of the Canadian 
      Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health), etanercept being the reference drug. 
      We defined delta value for therapeutic equivalence as a difference in the efficacy 
      of 25% among the different treatment options. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fourteen 
      studies (four for ustekinumab, three for adalimumab, three for infliximab and four 
      for etanercept) were included. The indirect comparison results reveal that 
      ustekinumab, adalimumab and infliximab were statistically superior to etanercept 
      with an absolute risk difference for PASI 75 of 12% (95% CI = 5·9-18%), 11% (95% 
      CI = 5·3-16·7%) and 24% (29·7-18·3%) respectively. However, in all situations, the 
      95% confidence interval does not achieve clinical relevance as no delta exceeds the 
      previously set value (25%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Ustekinumab, adalimumab, 
      infliximab and etanercept can be regarded as clinical equivalents for the treatment 
      of psoriasis. Choice between these agents therefore depends on their relative safety 
      profiles, individual contra-indications and cost effectiveness.

TI  - Matching-adjusted indirect comparison of adalimumab vs etanercept and infliximab for 
      the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.
PG  - 479-89
LID - 10.3111/13696998.2013.768530 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: No head-to-head trial has compared the efficacy of adalimumab vs 
      etanercept and infliximab for psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This study implements a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison technique to address that gap. METHODS: 
      Patient-level data from a placebo-controlled trial of adalimumab (ADEPT) were 
      re-weighted to match average baseline characteristics from pivotal published trials 
      of etanercept and infliximab. ADEPT patients were re-weighted by odds of enrollment 
      in comparator trials, estimated using logistic regression. Matched-on 
      characteristics included PsA duration, age, gender, severity, active psoriasis, and 
      concomitant treatment. After matching, placebo-adjusted treatment arms were compared 
      at weeks 12 (or 14) and 24. Outcomes included ACR20/50/70, PsARC, HAQ, and modified 
      TSS. PASI50/75/90 were compared for patients with active psoriasis. Cost per 
      responder (CPR) was assessed in the US and Germany using matching-adjusted 
      end-points and drug list prices. Statistical significance was assessed using 
      weighted t-tests. RESULTS: After matching, adalimumab-treated patients had greater 
      placebo-adjusted rates of ACR70 and PASI50/75/90 at week 24 compared with etanercept 
      (all p < 0.05). Adalimumab patients had a higher placebo-adjusted rate of ACR70 than 
      infliximab at week 14 (p = 0.034). Adalimumab treatment had lower CPR for ACR70 and 
      PASI50/75/90 compared with etanercept at week 24, in both the US and Germany (all 
      p < 0.02). Adalimumab had lower CPR than infliximab for all outcomes at week 24 (all 
      p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Adalimumab is associated with higher ACR70 and PASI50/75/90 
      response rates than etanercept at week 24 and a higher ACR70 response rate than 
      infliximab at week 14. Adalimumab has significant advantages over etanercept and 
      infliximab in CPR across multiple end-points. KEY LIMITATIONS: The matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison method cannot account for unobserved differences in patient 
      characteristics across trials, and only a head-to-head randomized clinical trial can 
      fully avoid the limitations of indirect comparisons. CPR findings are limited to the 
      US and German markets, and may not be generalizable to other markets with different 
      relative pricing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe rank reversal as a source of inconsistent interpretation 
      intrinsic to indirect comparison (Bucher HC, Guyatt GH, Griffith LE, Walter SD. The 
      results of direct and indirect treatment comparisons in meta-analysis of randomized 
      controlled trials. J Clin Epi 1997;50:683-91) of treatments and to propose best 
      practice. METHODS: We prove our main points with intuition, examples, graphs, and 
      mathematical proofs. We also provide software and discuss implications for research 
      and policy. RESULTS: When comparing treatments by indirect means and sorting them by 
      effect size, three common measures of comparison (risk ratio, risk difference, and 
      odds ratio) may lead to vastly different rankings. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of risk 
      measure matters when making indirect comparisons of treatments. The choice should 
      depend primarily on the study design and the conceptual framework for that study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite many interventions that have been tried, controversy remains 
      regarding the efficacy of interventions for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), so 
      we aimed to evaluate the best evidence from recent meta-analyses. METHODS: We 
      searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for interventions which have been 
      used for CIN. We included only the most recent meta-analysis of each intervention. 
      We extracted data on the methodology, quality and results of each meta-analysis. We 
      performed narrative synthesis and adjusted indirect comparison of interventions that 
      were shown to be statistically significant compared with a placebo. RESULTS: We 
      included 7 systematic reviews and meta-analyses involving 9 different interventions 
      for CIN, with a total of 15 976 participants. A significantly decreased risk of CIN 
      was reported in meta-analysis of the following interventions: N-acetylcysteine [odds 
      ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.88, I(2)=64%], theophylline 
      [relative risk (RR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.26-0.89, I(2)=44%], statins (RR 0.51, 95% CI 
      0.34-0.77, I(2)=0%) and sodium bicarbonate (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.86, I(2)=49%). 
      Furosemide was shown to increase the risk of CIN (RR 3.27, 95% CI 1.48-7.26, 
      I(2)=0%). Other interventions such as renal replacement therapy, 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dopamine and fenoldapam failed to show any 
      significant difference from the control group. CONCLUSION: Although there is some 
      evidence to suggest that N-acetylcysteine, theophylline, sodium bicarbonate and 
      statins may reduce incidence of CIN, limitations in the study quality and 
      heterogeneity preclude any firm recommendations. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: 
      N-acetylcysteine, theophylline, sodium bicarbonate and statins show some promise as 
      potentially efficacious agents for preventing CIN, but more high-quality studies are 
      needed before they can be recommended for use in routine practice.

AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to investigate the relative bioavailability 
      between the generic tacrolimus products that are presently authorized in Spain by 
      adjusted indirect comparison. This was based on demonstration of bioequivalence with 
      the reference product (Prograf, Astellas Pharma), which makes these generic 
      tacrolimus products prescribable, switchable and therapeutically equivalent to the 
      reference product; yet, according to Spanish legislation, only prescribers can 
      switch tacrolimus-containing products. METHODS: Data from independent bioequivalence 
      studies that compare each generic product with the reference product were combined 
      by adjusted indirect comparisons to investigate the relative bioavailability between 
      generic drug products, since there is no direct bioequivalence study comparing 
      generics to each other. RESULTS: Eight generic tacrolimus products in the form of 
      capsules are presently authorized in Spain, but only five are marketed. These eight 
      products represent only three different generic product developments. One product is 
      authorized with four different names/companies, while another is authorized under 
      three different names/companies. The adjusted indirect comparisons between generic 
      products show bioequivalence within the conventional 80-125 % confidence interval 
      acceptance criteria for area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax). 
      CONCLUSION: Not only are the generic products bioequivalent with the reference 
      product, but also with each other.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Indirect comparison methods have been increasingly used to assess the 
      effectiveness of different interventions comparatively. This study evaluated a Trial 
      Similarity and Evidence Consistency Assessment (TSECA) framework for assessing key 
      assumptions underlying the validity of indirect comparisons. STUDY DESIGN AND 
      SETTING: We applied the TSECA framework to 94 Cochrane Systematic Reviews that 
      provided data to compare two interventions by both direct and indirect comparisons. 
      Using the TSECA framework, two reviewers independently assessed and scored trial 
      similarity and evidence consistency. A detailed case study provided further insight 
      into the usefulness and limitations of the framework proposed. RESULTS: Trial 
      similarity and evidence consistency scores obtained using the assessment framework 
      were not associated with statistically significant inconsistency between direct and 
      indirect estimates. The case study illustrated that the assessment framework could 
      be used to identify potentially important differences in participants, 
      interventions, and outcome measures between different sets of trials in the indirect 
      comparison. CONCLUSION: Although the overall trial similarity and evidence 
      consistency scores are unlikely to be sufficiently accurate for predicting 
      inconsistency between direct and indirect estimates, the assessment framework 
      proposed in this study can be a useful tool for identifying between-trial 
      differences that may threaten the validity of indirect treatment comparisons.

TI  - Impact of evergreening on patients and health insurance: a meta analysis and 
      reimbursement cost analysis of citalopram/escitalopram antidepressants.
PG  - 142
LID - 10.1186/1741-7015-10-142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: "Evergreening" refers to the numerous strategies whereby owners of 
      pharmaceutical products use patent laws and minor drug modifications to extend their 
      monopoly privileges on the drug. We aimed to evaluate the impact of evergreening 
      through the case study of the antidepressant citalopram and its chiral switch form 
      escitalopram by evaluating treatment efficacy and acceptability for patients, as 
      well as health insurance costs for society. METHODS: To assess efficacy and 
      acceptability, we performed meta-analyses for efficacy and acceptability. We 
      compared direct evidence (meta-analysis of results of head-to-head trials) and 
      indirect evidence (adjusted indirect comparison of results of placebo-controlled 
      trials). To assess health insurance costs, we analyzed individual reimbursement data 
      from a representative sample of the French National Health Insurance Inter-regime 
      Information System (SNIIR-AM) from 2003 to 2010, which allowed for projecting these 
      results to the whole SNIIR-AM population (53 million people). RESULTS: In the 
      meta-analysis of seven head-to-head trials (2,174 patients), efficacy was 
      significantly better for escitalopram than citalopram (combined odds ratio (OR) 1.60 
      (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.46)). However, for the adjusted indirect 
      comparison of 10 citalopram and 12 escitalopram placebo-controlled trials, 2,984 and 
      3,777 patients respectively, efficacy was similar for the two drug forms (combined 
      indirect OR 1.03 (0.82 to 1.30)). Because of the discrepancy, we could not combine 
      direct and indirect data (test of inconsistency, P = 0.07). A similar discrepancy 
      was found for treatment acceptability. The overall reimbursement cost burden for the 
      citalopram, escitalopram and its generic forms was 120.6 million Euros in 2010, with 
      96.8 million Euros for escitalopram. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefit of 
      escitalopram versus citalopram remains uncertain. In our case of evergreening, 
      escitalopram represented a substantially high proportion of the overall 
      reimbursement cost burden as compared with citalopram and the generic forms.

TI  - A framework for organizing and selecting quantitative approaches for benefit-harm 
      assessment.
PG  - 173
LID - 10.1186/1471-2288-12-173 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several quantitative approaches for benefit-harm assessment of health 
      care interventions exist but it is unclear how the approaches differ. Our aim was to 
      review existing quantitative approaches for benefit-harm assessment and to develop 
      an organizing framework that clarifies differences and aids selection of 
      quantitative approaches for a particular benefit-harm assessment. METHODS: We 
      performed a review of the literature to identify quantitative approaches for 
      benefit-harm assessment. Our team, consisting of clinicians, epidemiologists, and 
      statisticians, discussed the approaches and identified their key characteristics. We 
      developed a framework that helps investigators select quantitative approaches for 
      benefit-harm assessment that are appropriate for a particular decisionmaking 
      context. RESULTS: Our framework for selecting quantitative approaches requires a 
      concise definition of the treatment comparison and population of interest, 
      identification of key benefit and harm outcomes, and determination of the need for a 
      measure that puts all outcomes on a single scale (which we call a benefit and harm 
      comparison metric). We identified 16 quantitative approaches for benefit-harm 
      assessment. These approaches can be categorized into those that consider single or 
      multiple key benefit and harm outcomes, and those that use a benefit-harm comparison 
      metric or not. Most approaches use aggregate data and can be used in the context of 
      single studies or systematic reviews. Although the majority of approaches provides a 
      benefit and harm comparison metric, only four approaches provide measures of 
      uncertainty around the benefit and harm comparison metric (such as a 95 percent 
      confidence interval). None of the approaches considers the actual joint distribution 
      of benefit and harm outcomes, but one approach considers competing risks when 
      calculating profile-specific event rates. Nine approaches explicitly allow 
      incorporating patient preferences. CONCLUSION: The choice of quantitative approaches 
      depends on the specific question and goal of the benefit-harm assessment as well as 
      on the nature and availability of data. In some situations, investigators may 
      identify only one appropriate approach. In situations where the question and 
      available data justify more than one approach, investigators may want to use 
      multiple approaches and compare the consistency of results. When more evidence on 
      relative advantages of approaches accumulates from such comparisons, it will be 
      possible to make more specific recommendations on the choice of approaches.

      venous thromboembolism. DESIGN: Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis. 
      Data were extracted independently by two investigators. An adjusted indirect 
      comparison was performed to compare between novel oral anticoagulants. DATA SOURCES: 
      Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to April 2012). Hand searching 
      of relevant scientific works and contact with experts. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised 
      controlled trials of novel oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists 
      for acute venous thromboembolism. Selected outcomes were recurrent events, major 
      bleeding, and all cause mortality. RESULTS: Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, 
      involving 16,701 patients evaluated for efficacy and 16,611 for safety. Data were 
      stratified according to different novel oral anticoagulants. For recurrent acute 
      venous thromboembolism, there were no significant differences in events rates 
      between any of the anticoagulants and conventional treatment (rivaroxaban (four 
      studies): relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.31; dabigatran (two 
      studies): 1.09, 0.76 to 1.57; ximelagatran (two studies): 1.06, 0.62 to 1.80; and 
      apixaban (one study): 0.98, 0.20 to 4.79). Rivaroxaban reduced the risk of major 
      bleeding compared with conventional treatment (0.57, 0.39 to 0.84), whereas other 
      novel oral anticoagulants did not (0.76 (0.49 to 1.18) for dabigatran; 0.54 (0.28 to 
      1.03) for ximelagatran; 2.95 (0.12 to 71.82) for apixaban). For all cause mortality 
      there were no significant differences between the novel oral anticoagulants and 
      conventional treatment (0.96 (0.72 to 1.27) for rivaroxaban; 1.00 (0.67 to 1.50) for 
      dabigatran; 0.67 (0.42 to 1.08) for ximelagatran; 6.89 (0.36 to 132.06) for 
      apixaban). The adjusted indirect comparison between rivaroxaban and dabigatran did 
      not show superiority of either drug over the others for major bleeding (0.75, 0.41 
      to 1.34) or the other endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with vitamin K antagonists, 
      the novel oral anticoagulants had a similar risk of recurrence of acute venous 
      thromboembolism and all cause mortality, though rivaroxaban was associated with a 
      reduced risk of bleeding.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To do an indirect comparison analysis of apixaban against dabigatran 
      etexilate (2 doses) and rivaroxaban (1 dose), as well as of rivaroxaban against 
      dabigatranetexilate (2 doses), for their relative efficacy and safety against each 
      other, with particular focus on the secondary prevention population for stroke 
      prevention in atrial fibrillation. A secondary objective was to do the same analysis 
      in the primary prevention cohort. DESIGN: Indirect treatment comparisons of phase 
      III clinical trials of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, with a focus on the 
      secondary prevention cohorts. A secondary analysis was done on the primary 
      prevention cohort. DATA SOURCES: Medline and Central (up to June 2012), clinical 
      trials registers, conference proceedings, and websites of regulatory agencies. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials of rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or apixaban 
      compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: In the 
      secondary prevention (previous stroke) subgroup, when apixaban was compared with 
      dabigatran (110 mg and 150 mg twice daily) for efficacy and safety endpoints, the 
      only significant difference seen was less myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 0.39, 
      95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.95) with apixaban compared with dabigatran 150 mg 
      twice daily. No significant differences were seen in efficacy and most safety 
      endpoints between apixaban or dabigatran 150 mg twice daily versus rivaroxaban. Less 
      haemorrhagic stroke (hazard ratio 0.15, 0.03 to 0.66), vascular death (0.64, 0.42 to 
      0.99), major bleeding (0.68, 0.47 to 0.99), and intracranial bleeding (0.27, 0.10 to 
      0.73) were seen with dabigatran 110 mg twice daily versus rivaroxaban. In the 
      primary prevention (no previous stroke) subgroup, apixaban was superior to 
      dabigatran 110 mg twice daily for disabling or fatal stroke (hazard ratio 0.59, 0.36 
      to 0.97). Compared with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, apixaban was associated with 
      more stroke (hazard ratio 1.45, 1.01 to 2.08) and with less major bleeding (0.75, 
      0.60 to 0.94), gastrointestinal bleeding (0.61, 0.42 to 0.89), and other location 
      bleeding (0.74, 0.58 to 0.94). Compared with rivaroxaban, dabigatran 110 mg twice 
      daily was associated with more myocardial infarction events. No significant 
      differences were seen for the main efficacy and safety endpoints between dabigatran 
      150 mg twice daily and rivaroxaban, or in efficacy endpoints between apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban. Apixaban was associated with less major bleeding (hazard ratio 0.61, 
      0.48 to 0.78) than rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS: For secondary prevention, apixaban, 
      rivaroxaban, and dabigatran had broadly similar efficacy for the main endpoints, 
      although the endpoints of haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death, major bleeding, and 
      intracranial bleeding were less common with dabigatran 110 mg twice daily than with 
      rivaroxaban. For primary prevention, the three drugs showed some differences in 
      relation to efficacy and bleeding. These results are hypothesis generating and 
      should be confirmed in a head to head randomised trial.

TI  - Cost effectiveness of guanfacine extended-release versus atomoxetine for the 
      treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: application of a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 381-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: About 7% of children and adolescents are diagnosed with 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the US. Patients with ADHD who 
      are intolerant of or do not have an optimal response to stimulants often use 
      non-stimulants as alternative therapies. Guanfacine extended-release (GXR) and 
      atomoxetine (ATX) are the only non-stimulants approved by the US Food and Drug 
      Administration for once-daily use in the treatment of children and adolescents with 
      ADHD in the US. ATX has been on the market since 2002 while GXR was recently 
      approved in 2009. To date, there is no comparative effectiveness or 
      cost-effectiveness study comparing the two drugs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study 
      was to assess the cost effectiveness of GXR versus ATX for the treatment of ADHD in 
      children and adolescents, using the comparative efficacy results from a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). METHODS: The MAIC method was used to 
      compare the efficacy between GXR (target dose and lower doses) and ATX (target dose) 
      in the absence of head-to-head clinical trials. Individual patients in the GXR 
      trials were weighted such that the summary baseline characteristics and the efficacy 
      of the placebo arm of the GXR trials matched exactly with those from published ATX 
      trials. After weighting, the efficacy (i.e. change in the ADHD rating scale, fourth 
      edition [ADHD-RS-IV] total score from baseline) was compared between each GXR dosing 
      group and the ATX group. The results from the MAIC analyses were used to populate a 
      1-year Markov model that is used to compare the cost effectiveness of GXR versus ATX 
      from a US third-party payer perspective. Effectiveness outcomes for each treatment 
      group were estimated as the proportion of responders, defined as patients with ≥25% 
      reduction in ADHD-RS-IV total score from baseline, and average quality-adjusted life 
      years (QALYs). Utilities associated with response/non-response and disutilities due 
      to adverse events were applied in the model. Costs included drug and medical service 
      costs and were inflated to 2011 US dollars ($US). Incremental cost/QALY and 
      incremental cost/responder were estimated. Univariate sensitivity analyses were 
      conducted by varying all model parameters, including costs, utilities, and response 
      rate. RESULTS: The target dose of GXR was 0.12 mg/kg/day. In match-adjusted 
      populations with balanced baseline characteristics, patients receiving GXR at the 
      dose of 0.09-0.12(p = 0.0016) [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] and 0.075-0.09 mg/kg/day 
      (p = 0.0248) had better efficacy, while those receiving GXR at the dose of 
      0.046-0.075 mg/kg/day had comparable efficacy (p = 0.0699), compared with patients 
      receiving ATX at the target dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day. In the base case of the 
      cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), GXR had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 
      $US10 637/QALY and $US853/responder, compared with ATX (incremental costs: $US74; 
      incremental effectiveness: 0.007 QALYs and 86 responders per 1000 patients treated). 
      Results of all univariate sensitivity analyses showed that the model results were 
      robust to changes in model inputs. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first 
      application of the novel comparative efficacy method of MAIC to a CEA model. The 
      MAIC results indicate that GXR (0.075-0.12 mg/kg/day) was more effective than ATX 
      (1.2 mg/kg/day) in the trial population. The CEA results indicate that GXR is cost 
      effective compared with ATX for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents.

TI  - Mixed treatment comparison of the treatment discontinuations of biologic 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in adults with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 1491-505
LID - 10.1345/aph.1R203 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Introduction of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) 
      has considerably changed treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over the 
      past decade. Very little information is available on comparative discontinuation 
      rates of the biologics. OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment discontinuations for 9 
      biologic DMARDs in adults with RA. METHODS: We searched electronic databases through 
      May 2012 to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with RA that 
      compared biologic DMARDs with placebo or another biologic DMARD. The primary outcome 
      was treatment discontinuation during the blinded phase of the trials, measured as 
      overall withdrawals, withdrawals resulting from lack of efficacy, and withdrawals 
      resulting from adverse events. Random-effects meta-analysis estimated the effect 
      size for individual agents, and adjusted indirect comparisons were made between 
      biologics using mixed treatment comparisons (MTC) meta-analysis. RESULTS: Forty-four 
      trials were included in the analysis. In comparison with placebo, biologics were 
      less likely to be withdrawn because of lack of efficacy (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.17 to 
      0.27) and more likely to be withdrawn because of an adverse event (OR 1.41, 95% CI 
      1.16 to 1.70). Based on the MTC, certolizumab had the most favorable overall 
      withdrawal profile, followed by etanercept and rituximab. Certolizumab had lower 
      relative withdrawal rates resulting from lack of efficacy than adalimumab, anakinra, 
      and infliximab. Anakinra had higher relative withdrawal rates resulting from lack of 
      efficacy than most other biologics. Certolizumab and infliximab had more, while 
      etanercept had fewer, withdrawals because of adverse events than most other drugs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on MTC using data from RCTs, differences in discontinuation rates 
      were observed, generally favoring certolizumab, etanercept, and rituximab over other 
      biologic DMARDs. These potential differences need to be further explored in 
      head-to-head trials or well-conducted observational studies.

TI  - Statistical approaches to indirectly compare bioequivalence between generics: a 
      comparison of methodologies employing artemether/lumefantrine 20/120 mg tablets as 
      prequalified by WHO.
PG  - 1611-8
LID - 10.1007/s00228-012-1396-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare different methods of adjusted 
      indirect comparisons that can be used to investigate the relative bioavailability of 
      different generic products. To achieve this goal, generic artemether/lumefantrine 
      20/120 mg tablets that have been prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
      were selected as model products for study. METHODS: Data from three bioequivalence 
      studies conducted independently that compared three generics with the same reference 
      product were used to indirectly determine the relative bioavailability between the 
      generics themselves. RESULTS: The different methods of indirect comparison examined 
      in this study provide consistent results. Methods based on the assumption of a large 
      sample size give slightly narrower 90 % confidence intervals. Therefore, the use of 
      methods based on the t test is recommended. Given the precision of the area under 
      the time-concentration curve (AUC) data, it is possible to conclude that the extent 
      of exposure of artemether and lumefantrine is bioequivalent between the different 
      generics studied. However, given the precision of the drug peak concentration 
      (C(max)) data, it is not possible to demonstrate equivalence within the conventional 
      acceptance range for all comparisons; it is possible to conclude bioequivalence 
      within the widened acceptance range 75-133 %. CONCLUSIONS: From a clinical 
      viewpoint, not only are these prequalified generics bioequivalent and 
      interchangeable with the reference product (Coartem, Novartis), but also the 
      existing indirect evidence makes it possible to conclude that these WHO prequalified 
      products are bioequivalent between themselves with respect to the AUC. The lack of 
      the necessary precision to demonstrate bioequivalence between generics with respect 
      to the C(max) within the conventional acceptance range does not preclude considering 
      them as interchangeable, if necessary, since C(max) is considered to be of less 
      clinical relevance for the relevant therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the absence of head-to-head randomized trials, indirect comparisons of 
      treatments across separate trials can be performed. However, these analyses may be 
      biased by cross-trial differences in patient populations, sensitivity to modeling 
      assumptions, and differences in the definitions of outcome measures. The objective 
      of this study was to demonstrate how incorporating individual patient data (IPD) 
      from trials of one treatment into indirect comparisons can address several 
      limitations that arise in analyses based only on aggregate data. METHODS: 
      Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) use IPD from trials of one treatment 
      to match baseline summary statistics reported from trials of another treatment. 
      After matching, by using an approach similar to propensity score weighting, 
      treatment outcomes are compared across balanced trial populations. This method is 
      illustrated by reviewing published MAICs in different therapeutic areas. A novel 
      analysis in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder further demonstrates the 
      applicability of the method. The strengths and limitations of MAICs are discussed in 
      comparison to those of indirect comparisons that use only published aggregate data. 
      RESULTS: Example applications were selected to illustrate how indirect comparisons 
      based only on aggregate data can be limited by cross-trial differences in patient 
      populations, differences in the definitions of outcome measures, and sensitivity to 
      modeling assumptions. The use of IPD and MAIC is shown to address these limitations 
      in the selected examples by reducing or removing the observed cross-trial 
      differences. An important assumption of MAIC, as in any comparison of nonrandomized 
      treatment groups, is that there are no unobserved cross-trial differences that could 
      confound the comparison of outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect treatment comparisons can 
      be limited by cross-trial differences. By combining IPD with published aggregate 
      data, MAIC can reduce observed cross-trial differences and provide decision makers 
      with timely comparative evidence.

TI  - Combining individual patient data and aggregate data in mixed treatment comparison 
      meta-analysis: Individual patient data may be beneficial if only for a subset of 
      trials.
PG  - 914-30
LID - 10.1002/sim.5584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis is the gold standard. 
      Aggregate data (AD) and IPD can be combined using conventional pairwise 
      meta-analysis when IPD cannot be obtained for all relevant studies. We extend the 
      methodology to combine IPD and AD in a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) 
      meta-analysis. METHODS: The proposed random-effects MTC models combine IPD and AD 
      for a dichotomous outcome. We study the benefits of acquiring IPD for a subset of 
      trials when assessing the underlying consistency assumption by including 
      treatment-by-covariate interactions in the model. We describe three different model 
      specifications that make increasingly stronger assumptions regarding the 
      interactions. We illustrate the methodology through application to real data sets to 
      compare drugs for treating malaria by using the outcome unadjusted treatment success 
      at day 28. We compare results from AD alone, IPD alone and all data. RESULTS: When 
      IPD contributed (i.e. either using IPD alone or combining IPD and AD), the chains 
      converged, and we identified statistically significant regression coefficients for 
      the interactions. Using IPD alone, we were able to compare only three of the six 
      treatments of interest. When models were fitted to AD, the treatment effects and 
      regression coefficients for the interactions were far more imprecise, and the chains 
      did not converge. CONCLUSIONS: The models combining IPD and AD encapsulated all 
      available evidence. When exploring interactions, it can be beneficial to obtain IPD 
      for a subset of trials and to combine IPD with additional AD.

      treatment comparisons.
PG  - 138
LID - 10.1186/1471-2288-12-138 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Indirect treatment comparison (ITC) and mixed treatment comparisons 
      (MTC) have been increasingly used in network meta-analyses. This simulation study 
      comprehensively investigated statistical properties and performances of commonly 
      used ITC and MTC methods, including simple ITC (the Bucher method), frequentist and 
      Bayesian MTC methods. METHODS: A simple network of three sets of two-arm trials with 
      a closed loop was simulated. Different simulation scenarios were based on different 
      number of trials, assumed treatment effects, extent of heterogeneity, bias and 
      inconsistency. The performance of the ITC and MTC methods was measured by the type I 
      error, statistical power, observed bias and mean squared error (MSE). RESULTS: When 
      there are no biases in primary studies, all ITC and MTC methods investigated are on 
      average unbiased. Depending on the extent and direction of biases in different sets 
      of studies, ITC and MTC methods may be more or less biased than direct treatment 
      comparisons (DTC). Of the methods investigated, the simple ITC method has the 
      largest mean squared error (MSE). The DTC is superior to the ITC in terms of 
      statistical power and MSE. Under the simulated circumstances in which there are no 
      systematic biases and inconsistencies, the performances of MTC methods are generally 
      better than the performance of the corresponding DTC methods. For inconsistency 
      detection in network meta-analysis, the methods evaluated are on average unbiased. 
      The statistical power of commonly used methods for detecting inconsistency is very 
      low. CONCLUSIONS: The available methods for indirect and mixed treatment comparisons 
      have different advantages and limitations, depending on whether data analysed 
      satisfies underlying assumptions. To choose the most valid statistical methods for 
      research synthesis, an appropriate assessment of primary studies included in 
      evidence network is required.

TI  - Two zotarolimus-eluting stent generations: a meta-analysis of 12 randomised trials 
      versus other limus-eluting stents and an adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 1632-40
LID - 10.1136/heartjnl-2012-302519 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of two zotarolimus-eluting stent 
      generations versus other limus-eluting stents (LES), and to compare Resolute 
      zotarolimus-eluting stents (R-ZES) with Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stents (E-ZES). 
      BACKGROUND: The performance of zotarolimus-eluting stents versus other LES, and the 
      possible improvements of R-ZES versus E-ZES still remain to be defined. METHODS: We 
      undertook a meta-analysis of trials in which patients were randomly assigned to 
      percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with R-ZES versus LES, or with E-ZES 
      versus LES, as well as an indirect comparison of R-ZES versus E-ZES, with LES as 
      common comparator. The primary efficacy endpoint was ischaemia-driven target vessel 
      revascularisation (ID-TVR); the primary safety endpoints were myocardial infarction 
      (MI), cardiac death and cumulative definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST). RESULTS: 
      Overall, 13'709 patients were assigned to PCI with R-ZES versus LES (n=7185) or with 
      E-ZES versus LES (n=6524). The risk of ID-TVR (OR (95% CI)=1.06 (0.90 to 1.25), 
      p=0.47), MI (1.00 (0.81 to 1.25), p=0.97), cardiac death (0.99 (0.69 to 1.42), 
      p=0.96) and ST (1.18 (0.68 to 2.03), p=0.56) did not differ between R-ZES and LES. 
      Patients receiving E-ZES were more likely to undergo ID-TVR as compared with those 
      receiving LES (1.95 (1.40 to 2.73), p<0.0001). The risk of MI (0.91 (0.54 to 1.54), 
      p=0.73), cardiac death (1.02 (0.54 to 1.91), p=0.96) and ST (1.10 (0.50 to 2.44), 
      p=0.81) was similar between E-ZES and LES. At indirect comparison, PCI with R-ZES 
      versus E-ZES reduced the risk of ID-TVR (0.54 (0.37 to 0.78), p=0.001), without 
      increasing MI (1.09 (0.62 to 1.93), p=0.74), cardiac death (0.97 (0.46 to 2.00), 
      p=0.93) and ST (1.07 (0.40 to 2.80), p=0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The antirestenotic 
      efficacy of Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents is superior to Endeavor 
      zotarolimus-eluting stents and similar to other limus-eluting stents. Endeavor 
      zotarolimus-eluting stents increase the risk of reinterventions as compared with 
      other limus-eluting stents. First and second-generation zotarolimus-eluting stents 
      have similar thrombogenicity compared with other limus-eluting stents.

TI  - The cost effectiveness of newer epilepsy treatments: a review of the literature on 
      partial-onset seizures.
PG  - 903-23
LID - 10.2165/11597110-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, 
      affecting more than 3 million people in Europe. This paper reviews the published 
      evidence regarding the cost effectiveness of second-generation antiepileptic drugs 
      (AEDs). METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed, using the databases 
      Academic Search Complete, Econlit, EMBASE and MEDLINE. Health economic evaluations 
      of newer (second-generation) AEDs, published as full-length journal articles, were 
      searched for. We focused on evaluations of newer AEDs as treatment for partial-onset 
      seizures. 470 studies were initially identified and 19 were finally included. 
      Information regarding (i) AEDs studied, (ii) cost effectiveness, and (iii) a variety 
      of health economic modelling specifics was extracted from each study. Then, the 
      included studies were summarized and a quality assessment was performed, according 
      to the British Medical Journal's guidelines for economic studies. RESULTS: The 
      results were as follows: (i) the cost per additional QALY for newer AEDs used as 
      adjunctive treatment, compared with standard therapy, ranged between $US19 139 
      (levetiracetam) and $US57 210 (pregabalin) [year 2010 values]; no cost-effectiveness 
      evidence was identified for felbamate, eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine or tiagabine; 
      and (ii) all studies met at least 60% of the British Medical Journal's guidelines 
      criteria, and seven studies were found to satisfy more than 80% of the criteria. 
      Guidelines criteria not met involve inadequate reporting of input data and modelling 
      details, including validation and availability of models used for cost-effectiveness 
      calculations. CONCLUSIONS: Although failure to meet good practice guidelines 
      influences the reliability of the presented evidence adversely, a sufficient number 
      of the included studies were found to comply enough with the guidelines in order for 
      the qualitative content of the cost-effectiveness results - that some of the newer 
      AEDs are cost effective - to be reliable. In fact, this conclusion is likely to be 
      relatively robust, since the effect of improved seizure control on labour market 
      performance was not included in the base-case results in any of the included studies 
      and improved seizure control need only to have a moderate effect on sickness 
      absenteeism in order for the corresponding treatment to be cost effective even when 
      willingness to pay for an additional QALY is low. However, the cost effectiveness of 
      newer AEDs has only been studied for a small number of settings, and hence future 
      studies incorporating additional settings are needed.

TI  - Systematic review and adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis of oral 
      anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 711-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban are 
      alternatives to warfarin for preventing events in patients with atrial fibrillation. 
      Direct comparative studies between agents are unavailable. Our objective was to 
      conduct an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis between new oral agents in 
      atrial fibrillation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central 
      through February 2012 for randomized, controlled trials in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation evaluating apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban versus warfarin. For 
      dabigatran, only data from the Food and Drug Administration-approved dose were 
      included. Outcomes included the composite of stroke or systemic embolism, any 
      stroke, and major bleeding among, others. Outcomes were initially pooled using 
      standard random-effects methods, producing risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals. 
      Adjusted indirect comparisons using these pooled estimates were then performed. A 
      total of 44 733 patients from 4 studies were analyzed. Most analyses yielded no 
      differences between agents. Dabigatran lowered risk of composite outcome (risk 
      ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-1.00), ischemic stroke (0.67; 0.48-0.93), 
      and hemorrhagic stroke (0.45; 0.45-0.99) versus rivaroxaban. No differences in all 
      strokes or mortality were seen. Apixaban lowered the risk of major bleeding (0.74; 
      0.60-0.91) and gastrointestinal bleeding (0.58; 0.41-0.82) versus dabigatran and 
      major bleeding versus rivaroxaban (0.68; 0.55-0.83), but increased systemic emboli 
      versus rivaroxaban (3.86; 1.17-12.75). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in 
      efficacy and safety parameters may exist between oral anticoagulant agents in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. Apixaban lowers the risk of major and 
      gastrointestinal bleeding versus dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Dabigatran lowers the 
      composite of stroke or systemic emboli, and ischemic stroke versus rivaroxaban. 
      Head-to-head clinical trials are required to confirm these findings.

TI  - Dabigatran versus rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in 
      atrial fibrillation in Canada. Comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness.
PG  - 672-82
AB  - Canadian patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in whom anticoagulation is 
      appropriate have two new choices for anticoagulation for prevention of stroke and 
      systemic embolism--dabigatran etexilate (dabigatran) and rivaroxaban. Based on the 
      RE-LY and ROCKET AF trial results, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of 
      dabigatran (twice daily dosing of 150 mg or 110 mg based on patient age) versus 
      rivaroxaban from a Canadian payer perspective. A formal indirect treatment 
      comparison (ITC) of dabigatran versus rivaroxaban was performed, using dabigatran 
      clinical event rates from RE-LY for the safety-on-treatment population, adjusted to 
      the ROCKET AF population. A previously described Markov model was modified to 
      simulate anticoagulation treatment using ITC results as inputs. Model outputs 
      included total costs, event rates, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The ITC 
      found when compared to rivaroxaban, dabigatran had a lower risk of intracranial 
      haemorrhage (ICH) (relative risk [RR] = 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 - 
      0.67) and stroke (RR = 0.62; 95%CI 0.45-0.87). Over a lifetime horizon, the model 
      found dabigatran-treated patients experienced fewer ICHs (0.33 dabigatran vs. 0.71 
      rivaroxaban) and ischaemic strokes (3.40 vs. 3.96) per 100 patient-years, and 
      accrued more QALYs (6.17 vs. 6.01). Dabigatran-treated patients had lower acute care 
      and long-term follow-up costs per patient ($52,314 vs. $53,638) which more than 
      offset differences in drug costs ($7,299 vs. $6,128). In probabilistic analysis, 
      dabigatran had high probability of being the most cost-effective therapy at common 
      thresholds of willingness-to-pay (93% at a $20,000/QALY threshold). This study found 
      dabigatran is economically dominant versus rivaroxaban for prevention of stroke and 
      systemic embolism among Canadian AF patients.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of everolimus vs sunitinib in treating patients with advanced,

PG  - 55-64
LID - 10.3111/13696998.2012.720319 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus (Afinitor) and sunitinib (Sutent) were recently approved to 
      treat patients with advanced, progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). 
      (Afinitor is a registered trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East 
      Hanover, NJ, USA; Sutent is a registered trademark of Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, 
      USA.) This analysis examined the projected cost-effectiveness of everolimus vs 
      sunitinib in this setting from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A semi-Markov model 
      was developed to simulate a cohort of patients with advanced, progressive pNET and 
      to estimate the cost per life-year gained (LYG) and per quality-adjusted life-year 
      (QALY) gained when treating with everolimus vs sunitinib. Efficacy data were based 
      on a weight-adjusted indirect comparison of the agents using phase 3 trial data. 
      Model health states included: stable disease with no adverse events, stable disease 
      with adverse events, disease progression, and death. Therapy costs were based on 
      wholesale acquisition cost. Other costs such as physician visits, tests, 
      hospitalizations, and adverse event costs were obtained from literature and/or 
      primary research. Utility inputs were based on primary research. Sensitivity 
      analyses were conducted to test the model's robustness. RESULTS: In the base-case 
      analysis, everolimus was associated with an incremental 0.448 LYG (0.304 QALYs) at 
      an incremental cost of $12,673, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
      (ICER) of $28,281/LYG ($41,702/QALY gained). The ICER fell within the cost per QALY 
      range for many widely used oncology drugs. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that, 
      overall, there is a trend that everolimus is cost-effective compared to sunitinib in 
      this setting. LIMITATIONS: Results of the indirect analysis were not statistically 
      significant (p > 0.05). Assumptions that treatment patterns are the same across 
      therapies may not represent real-world practice. CONCLUSIONS: While the analysis is 
      limited by its reliance on an indirect comparison of two phase 3 studies, everolimus 
      is expected to be cost-effective relative to sunitinib in advanced, progressive 
      pNET.

TI  - A conditional error function approach for subgroup selection in adaptive clinical 
      trials.
PG  - 4309-20
LID - 10.1002/sim.5541 [doi]
AB  - Growing interest in personalised medicine and targeted therapies is leading to an 
      increase in the importance of subgroup analyses. If it is planned to view treatment 
      comparisons in both a predefined subgroup and the full population as co-primary 
      analyses, it is important that the statistical analysis controls the familywise type 
      I error rate. Spiessens and Debois (Cont. Clin. Trials, 2010, 31, 647-656) recently 
      proposed an approach specific for this setting, which incorporates an assumption 
      about the correlation based on the known sizes of the different groups, and showed 
      that this is more powerful than generic multiple comparisons procedures such as the 
      Bonferroni correction. If recruitment is slow relative to the length of time taken 
      to observe the outcome, it may be efficient to conduct an interim analysis. In this 
      paper, we propose a new method for an adaptive clinical trial with co-primary 
      analyses in a predefined subgroup and the full population based on the conditional 
      error function principle. The methodology is generic in that we assume test 
      statistics can be taken to be normally distributed rather than making any specific 
      distributional assumptions about individual patient data. In a simulation study, we 
      demonstrate that the new method is more powerful than previously suggested analysis 
      strategies. Furthermore, we show how the method can be extended to situations when 
      the selection is not based on the final but on an early outcome. We use a case study 
      in a targeted therapy in oncology to illustrate the use of the proposed methodology 
      with non-normal outcomes.

TI  - Results of indirect and mixed treatment comparison of fracture efficacy for 
      osteoporosis treatments: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 209-17
LID - 10.1007/s00198-012-2068-9 [doi]
AB  - Network meta-analysis techniques (meta-analysis, adjusted indirect comparison, and 
      mixed treatment comparison [MTC]) allow for treatment comparisons in the absence of 
      head-to-head trials. In this study, conditional estimates of relative treatment 
      efficacy derived through these techniques show important differences in the fracture 
      risk reduction profiles of marketed pharmacologic therapies for postmenopausal 
      osteoporosis. INTRODUCTION: This study illustrates how network meta-analysis 
      techniques (meta-analysis, adjusted indirect comparison, and MTC) can provide 
      comparisons of the relative efficacy of postmenopausal osteoporosis therapies in the 
      absence of comprehensive head-to-head trials. METHODS: Source articles were 
      identified in MEDLINE; EMBASE; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      (CENTRAL) via Wiley Interscience; and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature (CINAHL) between April 28, 2009 and November 4, 2009. Two reviewers 
      identified English-language articles reporting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      with on-label dosing of marketed osteoporosis agents and fracture endpoints. Trial 
      design, population characteristics, intervention and comparator, fracture outcomes, 
      and adverse events were abstracted for analysis. Primary analyses included data from 
      RCTs with fracture endpoints. Sensitivity analyses also included studies with 
      fractures reported through adverse event reports. Meta-analysis compared fracture 
      outcomes for pharmacological therapies vs. placebo (fixed and random effects 
      models); adjusted indirect comparisons and MTC assessed fracture risk in 
      postmenopausal women treated with denosumab vs. other agents. RESULTS: Using data 
      from 34 studies, random effects meta-analysis showed that all agents except 
      etidronate significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared with 
      placebo; denosumab, risedronate, and zoledronic acid significantly reduced the risk 
      for nonvertebral and hip fracture, while alendronate, strontium ranelate, and 
      teriparatide significantly reduced the risk for nonvertebral fractures. MTC showed 
      denosumab to be more effective than strontium ranelate, raloxifene, alendronate, and 
      risedronate in preventing new vertebral fractures. CONCLUSIONS: The conditional 
      estimates of relative treatment efficacy indicate that there are important 
      differences in fracture risk reduction profiles for marketed pharmacological 
      therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis.

AB  - Comparative effectiveness research is expected to play an important role in future 
      clinical and policy decision making in the US; however, the application of 
      comparative effectiveness methodologies to child health requires special attention 
      to aspects of health and healthcare that are specific to children. These special 
      considerations include the role of parent/caregiver as joint decision maker and 
      co-participant in many types of interventions, how the effectiveness of an 
      intervention varies by age and developmental stage, and the difficulties in 
      translating short-term data from childhood into projected effectiveness over the 
      lifespan. Each aspect of comparative effectiveness, such as conducting new studies, 
      synthesizing existing evidence, emphasizing real-world settings, considering 
      multiple decision makers, and measuring patient-relevant outcomes, will require 
      expanded definitions when considered in the context of child health. This paper 
      discusses how comparative effectiveness methods and concepts will differ when 
      applied to child health and suggests a potential role for decision analysis as a 
      method to synthesize data and project long-term outcomes. The initiation of 
      comparative effectiveness studies for children represents an exciting opportunity to 
      provide evidence that can guide clinical and policy decisions for child health.

      fibrillation.
PG  - 480-6
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.112.965988 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dabigatran, an oral thrombin inhibitor, and rivaroxaban and apixaban, 
      oral factor Xa inhibitors, have been found to be safe and effective in reducing 
      stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. We sought to compare the efficacy 
      and safety of the 3 new agents based on data from their published 
      warfarin-controlled randomized trials, using the method of adjusted indirect 
      comparisons. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included findings from 44 535 patients enrolled 
      in 3 trials of the efficacy of dabigatran (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term 
      Anticoagulation Therapy [RELY]), apixaban (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and 
      Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE]), and rivaroxaban 
      (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K 
      Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation 
      [ROCKET-AF]), each compared with warfarin. The primary efficacy end point was stroke 
      or systemic embolism; the safety end point we studied was major hemorrhage. To 
      address a lack of comparability between trial populations caused by the restriction 
      of ROCKET-AF to high-risk patients, we conducted a subgroup analysis in patients 
      with a CHADS(2) score ≥3. We found no statistically significant efficacy differences 
      among the 3 drugs, although apixaban and dabigatran were numerically superior to 
      rivaroxaban. Apixaban produced significantly fewer major hemorrhages than dabigatran 
      and rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS: An indirect comparison of new anticoagulants based on 
      existing trial data indicates that in patients with a CHADS(2) score ≥3 dabigatran 
      150 mg, apixaban 5 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 mg resulted in statistically similar rates 
      of stroke and systemic embolism, but apixaban had a lower risk of major hemorrhage 
      compared with dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Until head-to-head trials or large-scale 
      observational studies that reflect routine use of these agents are available, such 
      adjusted indirect comparisons based on trial data are one tool to guide initial 
      therapeutic choices.

TI  - Assessing the consistency assumption by exploring treatment by covariate 
      interactions in mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis: individual patient-level 
      covariates versus aggregate trial-level covariates.
PG  - 3840-57
LID - 10.1002/sim.5470 [doi]
AB  - Mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis allows several treatments to be 
      compared in a single analysis while utilising direct and indirect evidence. 
      Treatment by covariate interactions can be included in MTC models to explore how the 
      covariate modifies the treatment effects. If interactions exist, the assumptions 
      underlying MTCs may be invalidated. For conventional pair-wise meta-analysis, 
      important benefits regarding the investigation of such interactions, gained from 
      using individual patient data (IPD) rather than aggregate data (AD), have been 
      described. We aim to compare IPD MTC models including patient-level covariates with 
      AD MTC models including study-level covariates. IPD and AD random-effects MTC models 
      for dichotomous outcomes are specified. Three assumptions are made regarding the 
      interactions (i.e. independent, exchangeable and common interactions). The models 
      are applied to a dataset to compare four drugs for treating malaria (i.e. 
      amodiaquine-artesunate, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ), 
      artemether-lumefantrine and chlorproguanil-dapsone plus artesunate) using the 
      outcome unadjusted treatment success at day 28. The treatment effects and regression 
      coefficients for interactions from the IPD models were more precise than those from 
      AD models. Using IPD, assuming independent or exchangeable interactions, the 
      regression coefficient for chlorproguanil-dapsone plus artesunate versus DHAPQ was 
      statistically significant and assuming common interactions, the common coefficient 
      was significant; whereas using AD, no coefficients were significant. Using IPD, 
      DHAPQ was the best drug; whereas using AD, the best drug varied. Using AD models, 
      there was no evidence that the consistency assumption was invalid; whereas, the 
      assumption was questionable based on the IPD models. The AD analyses were 
      misleading.

TI  - Adjusted indirect comparison of new oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in 
      atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 949-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vit-K antagonists are the therapy of choice to prevent thromboembolic 
      events due to atrial fibrillation since many years. New oral anticoagulants (NOA) 
      showed encouraging results vs. warfarin but there are no data directly comparing 
      different NOA. We performed an adjusted indirect meta-analysis. METHODS: Randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) were searched. Efficacy end points were the cumulative rate 
      of thomboembolic stroke (TES) and systemic embolism (SE). Main safety end point was 
      the rate of hemorrhagic stroke (HS). RESULTS: Three RCTs (50578 patients) were 
      included. Overall, NOA were comparable to warfarin according to the cumulative risk 
      of TES and SE, as well as for TES alone. NOA were associated with a reduced rate of 
      SE [OR 0.64 (0.44, 0.94], P=0.02]. Compared to warfarin, NOA were associated with a 
      significantly reduced risk of HS [OR 0.43 (0.34, 0.55), P<0.001, NNT to avoid a HS 
      153] and all cause death [OR 0.90 [0.84, 0.96], P=0.03, NNT to save one fatality 
      43]. Head to head comparison showed that in terms of cumulative rate of TES/SE, as 
      well as of TES, none of the NOA was significantly superior to the others (all 
      Ps>0.05). Rivaroxaban showed superiority in the prevention of SE. Dabigatran 150 
      mg/twice daily was associated with the largest reduction in the risk of HS vs. 
      warfarin and vs. other NOA. Overall mortality was quite comparable across NOA. 
      CONCLUSION: Overall superiority of NOA over warfarin is largely influenced by the 
      reduction of HS. Dabigatran 150 mg/twice daily seems to have the best risk/benefit 
      profile.

AB  - Mixed treatment comparisons (MTC) extend the traditional pair-wise meta-analytic 
      framework to synthesize information on more than two interventions. Although most 
      MTCs use aggregate data (AD), a proportion of the evidence base might be available 
      at the individual level (IPD). We develop a series of novel Bayesian statistical MTC 
      models to allow for the simultaneous synthesis of IPD and AD, potentially 
      incorporating study and individual level covariates. The effectiveness of different 
      interventions to increase the provision of functioning smoke alarms in households 
      with children was used as a motivating dataset. This included 20 studies (11 AD and 
      9 IPD), including 11 500 participants. Incorporating the IPD into the network 
      allowed the inclusion of information on subject level covariates, which produced 
      markedly more accurate treatment-covariate interaction estimates than an analysis 
      solely on the AD from all studies. Including evidence at the IPD level in the MTC is 
      desirable when exploring participant level covariates; even when IPD is available 
      only for a fraction of the studies. Such modelling may not only reduce 
      inconsistencies within networks of trials but also assist the estimation of 
      intervention subgroup effects to guide more individualised treatment decisions.

AB  - Movement of individuals influences individual reproductive success, fitness, genetic 
      diversity and relationships among individuals within populations and gene exchange 
      among populations. Competition between males or females for mating opportunities 
      and/or local resources predicts a female bias in taxa with monogamous mating systems 
      and a male-biased dispersal in polygynous species. In birds and mammals, the 
      patterns of dispersal between sexes are well explored, while dispersal patterns in 
      protandrous hermaphroditic fish species have not been studied. We collected 549 
      adult individuals of Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) from four locations in the 
      South China Sea. To assess the difference in patterns of dispersal between sexes, we 
      genotyped all individuals with 18 microsatellites. Significant genetic 
      differentiation was detected among and within sampling locations. The parameters of 
      population structure (F(ST)), relatedness (r) and the mean assignment index (mAIC), 
      in combination with data on tagging-recapture, supplied strong evidences for 
      female-biased dispersal in the Asian seabass. This result contradicts our initial 
      hypothesis of no sex difference in dispersal. We suggest that inbreeding avoidance 
      of females, female mate choice under the condition of low mate competition among 
      males, and male resource competition create a female-biased dispersal. The bigger 
      body size of females may be a cause of the female-biased movement. Studies of 
      dispersal using data from DNA markers and tagging-recapture in hermaphroditic fish 
      species could enhance our understanding of patterns of dispersal in fish.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse clinical outcomes with new oral anticoagulants for prophylaxis 
      against venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement. DESIGN: 
      Systematic review, meta-analysis, and indirect treatment comparisons. DATA SOURCES: 
      Medline and CENTRAL (up to April 2011), clinical trials registers, conference 
      proceedings, and websites of regulatory agencies. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised 
      controlled trials of rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or apixaban compared with enoxaparin 
      for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement. 
      Two investigators independently extracted data. Relative risks of symptomatic venous 
      thromboembolism, clinically relevant bleeding, deaths, and a net clinical endpoint 
      (composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and death) were 
      estimated using a random effect meta-analysis. RevMan and ITC software were used for 
      direct and indirect comparisons, respectively. RESULTS: 16 trials in 38,747 patients 
      were included. Compared with enoxaparin, the risk of symptomatic venous 
      thromboembolism was lower with rivaroxaban (relative risk 0.48, 95% confidence 
      interval 0.31 to 0.75) and similar with dabigatran (0.71, 0.23 to 2.12) and apixaban 
      (0.82, 0.41 to 1.64). Compared with enoxaparin, the relative risk of clinically 
      relevant bleeding was higher with rivaroxaban (1.25, 1.05 to 1.49), similar with 
      dabigatran (1.12, 0.94 to 1.35), and lower with apixaban (0.82, 0.69 to 0.98). The 
      treatments did not differ on the net clinical endpoint in direct or indirect 
      comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: A higher efficacy of new anticoagulants was generally 
      associated with a higher bleeding tendency. The new anticoagulants did not differ 
      significantly for efficacy and safety.

AB  - Treatment of the central nervous system (CNS) is an essential therapy component for 
      childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Individual patient data from 47 trials 
      addressing 16 CNS treatment comparisons were analyzed. Event-free survival (EFS) was 
      similar for radiotherapy versus intrathecal (IT), and radiotherapy plus IT versus IV 
      methotrexate (IV MTX) plus IT. Triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) gave similar EFS but 
      poorer survival than intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX), but additional IV MTX 
      improved both outcomes. One trial resulted in similar EFS and survival with IV MTX 
      plus IT MTX versus TIT alone. Radiotherapy can generally be replaced by IT therapy. 
      TIT should be used with effective systemic therapy such as IV MTX.

TI  - Clinical and cost effectiveness of bevacizumab + FOLFIRI combination versus FOLFIRI 
      alone as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in South Korea.
PG  - 1408-19
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2012.05.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab has been extensively investigated in combination with 
      various standard chemotherapies in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer 
      (mCRC). However, a comparison to irinotecan + infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin 
      (FOLFIRI) is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To explore clinical effectiveness and 
      cost-effectiveness of adding bevacizumab to a regimen of FOLFIRI for the first-line 
      treatment of mCRC in the Republic of Korea by conducting an indirect treatment 
      comparison. METHODS: A health-economic model was developed to investigate the 
      possible health outcomes (life-years gained [LYG]), direct costs, and incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding bevacizumab to a FOLFIRI regimen. Data on 
      progression-free and overall survival were derived from randomized clinical trials 
      and were used in the indirect treatment comparison. The annual discount rate for 
      costs and outcomes was 5%. A lifetime horizon of 8 years was used. Sensitivity 
      analyses were carried out on all pivotal model assumptions. RESULTS: Incremental 
      mean overall survival among patients treated with bevacizumab + FOLFIRI varied 
      between 8.6 and 15.7 months compared with patients treated with FOLFIRI alone. The 
      deterministic base-case result was 1.177 LYG. The discounted ICERs ranged from μ31.8 
      to μ39.5 million/LYG, with the base-case result being μ34.5 million/LYG. Treatment 
      effect had the most impact on the outcomes in this model. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      there is no formal threshold for ICER per LYG in Korea, funding may be considered 
      for bevacizumab + FOLFIRI, particularly if the severity and end-of-life nature of 
      mCRC is taken into account.

      Well-Being Scale Self-Administered (QWB-SA), SF-6D(SF-36) or SF-6D(SF-12). In 
      addition to providing an overview of how different preference-based measures have 
      been adopted in SCI research to-date, a focus of evaluation was to collate and 
      appraise evidence for measurement properties and identify knowledge gaps. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-two articles were identified. No studies have used preference-based measures 
      in their conventional form, that is, to calculate quality-adjusted life years using 
      patient-level data. Eleven papers reported mean utility scores (across six different 
      instruments). Directly comparable data exists for only one SCI-specific sample, 
      which showed variation across EQ-5D (0.63), HUI-2 (0.81) and HUI-3 (0.68) index 
      scores. Indirect comparisons suggested differences between QWB-SA and SF-6D index 
      scores within tetraplegic and paraplegic patient groups. Only the QWB-SA and SF-6D 
      have undergone (partial) psychometric evaluation, with the respective authors 
      concluding that the measures have potential for SCI research. CONCLUSIONS: Despite 
      'cost-effectiveness' being an increasingly important consideration for decision 
      makers in all areas of health care, there is a distinct lack of conceptual or 
      empirical research regarding the appropriateness of alternative preference-based 
      HRQoL measures for SCI populations. Given the support for economic evaluation within 
      a cost-utility framework and the paucity of psychometric evidence regarding current 
      instruments, further research is needed.

TI  - Efficacy of once-daily indacaterol relative to alternative bronchodilators in COPD: 
      a patient-level mixed treatment comparison.
PG  - 524-33
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2012.01.009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Indacaterol was evaluated versus placebo, formoterol, and salmeterol in 
      randomized controlled trials. No direct comparisons, however, are available for 
      indacaterol 150 μg with formoterol or indacaterol 300 μg with salmeterol. 
      Indacaterol trial evidence was synthesized to provide coherent estimates of 
      indacaterol 150 μg and indacaterol 300 μg relative to formoterol, salmeterol, and 
      tiotropium. METHODS: Four randomized controlled trials were combined with Bayesian 
      mixed treatment comparisons by using individual patient-level data. End points of 
      interest were trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), St. George's 
      Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and response (≥ 4 points), and 
      Transition Dyspnea Index total score and response (≥ 1 point). RESULTS: Indacaterol 
      150 μg demonstrated a higher FEV(1) than did formoterol at 12 weeks and 6 months 
      (0.10 L difference; 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.06-0.14), as did indacaterol 300 
      μg versus salmeterol (0.06 L difference at 12 weeks; CrI = 0.02-0.10; 0.06 L at 6 
      months; CrI = 0.02-0.11). Regarding SGRQ, indacaterol 150 μg demonstrated a 
      comparable proportion of responders versus formoterol, as did indacaterol 300 μg 
      versus salmeterol. In comparison to tiotropium, indacaterol 150 μg demonstrated a 
      greater proportion of responders (odds ratio = 1.52 at 12 weeks; CrI 1.15-2.00). For 
      Transition Dyspnea Index, indacaterol 150 μg and formoterol showed a similar 
      response. Indacaterol 300 μg was more efficacious than salmeterol (odds ratio = 1.65 
      at 12 weeks; CrI 1.16-2.34). Overall, indacaterol 150 μg showed the greatest 
      efficacy for SGRQ and indacaterol 300 μg for FEV(1) and Transition Dyspnea Index. 
      CONCLUSION: Indacaterol is expected to be comparable to formoterol, salmeterol, and 
      tiotropium, providing higher FEV(1) than formoterol and salmeterol and greater 
      improvement in the SGRQ total score than tiotropium. Indacaterol 150 μg provided 
      comparable improvement in dyspnea, while indacaterol 300 μg demonstrated the 
      greatest response overall.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness research using matching-adjusted indirect comparison: an 
      application to treatment with guanfacine extended release or atomoxetine in children 
      with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and comorbid oppositional defiant 
      disorder.
PG  - 130-7

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To illustrate a matching-adjusted indirect comparison by comparing the 
      efficacy of guanfacine extended release (GXR) and atomoxetine (ATX) in reducing 
      oppositional symptoms in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and 
      comorbid oppositional defiant disorder. METHODS: Individual patient data were used 
      from a GXR trial; only published summary data were used from ATX trials. In a 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparison, individual patients from the GXR trial were 
      weighted such that their mean baseline characteristics matched those published for 
      ATX trials. Placebo-arm outcomes were then compared to further assess balance 
      between the matched populations. Changes in the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised 
      Short Form Oppositional Subscale from baseline to endpoint among GXR-treated and 
      ATX-treated patients were then compared. RESULTS: Before matching, the GXR (n = 143) 
      and ATX (n = 98) trial populations had significant differences in baseline 
      characteristics and placebo-arm outcomes. After matching, baseline characteristics 
      were well balanced across trials, and placebo-arm outcomes became nearly identical. 
      Comparing active treatment arms across the matched populations, GXR was associated 
      with a significantly greater reduction in mean Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised 
      Short form oppositional subscale compared with ATX {-5.0 [95% confidence interval 
      (CI): -6.6 to -3.4] vs. -2.4 [CI: -3.7 to -1.1], p = 0.01, effect size = 0.58}. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head randomized trials, matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparisons can provide timely and reliable comparative evidence for 
      decision makers and can be applied even when very few trials are available for the 
      treatments of interest.

LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) are widely used in African 
      countries, including Cameroon. Between 2005 and 2007, five randomized studies 
      comparing different treatment arms among artesunate-amodiaquine and other ACT were 
      conducted in Cameroonian children aged two to 60 months who had uncomplicated 
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In these studies, the categorical criterion proposed 
      by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess the relative effectiveness of 
      anti-malarial drugs was repeatedly evaluated on Days 14, 21 and 28 after treatment 
      initiation. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of different 
      treatments on this repeated ordinal outcome, hence using the fully available 
      information. METHODS: The quantitative synthesis was based on individual patient 
      data. Due to the incomplete block design concerning treatment arms between different 
      trials, a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis approach was adopted. The 
      repeated ordinal outcome was modelled through a latent variable, as a proportional 
      odds mixed model with trial, period and treatment arms as covariates. The model was 
      further complexified to account for the variance heterogeneity, and the individual 
      log-residual variance was modelled as a linear mixed model, as well. The effects of 
      individual covariates at inclusion, such as parasitaemia, fever, gender and weight, 
      were also tested. Model parameters were estimated using a Bayesian approach via the 
      WinBUGS software. After selecting the best model using Deviance Information 
      Criterion (DIC), mixed treatment comparisons were based on the estimated treatment 
      effects. RESULTS: Modeling the residual variance improved the model ability to 
      adjust the data. The results showed that, compared to artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), 
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHPP) was significantly more efficacious. 
      Artesunate-chlorproguanil-dapsone (ASCD) was less efficacious than 
      artesunate-sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (ASSP), artemether-lumefantrine (AMLM) and 
      DHPP, the difference with the latter being significant. No difference in efficacy 
      was found between ASAQ and AMLM. CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons 
      of a network of connected randomized trials with repeated measurements of the 
      primary categorical outcome allowed to take into account both the individual- and 
      between- studies sources of heterogeneity. The results of the present study complete 
      the previous quantitative review based on a binary outcome at a fixed time point, 
      suggesting that DHPP represents an alternative for the treatment of uncomplicated P. 
      falciparum malaria in Cameroonian children.

TI  - The role of adalimumab in rheumatic and autoimmune disorders: comparison with other 
      biologic agents.
PG  - 33-47
AB  - Adalimumab (ADA) is a biologic medication that dampens inflammatory pathways by 
      binding to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. The US Food and Drug 
      Administration has approved ADA as a medication for use in rheumatoid arthritis, 
      psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and 
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This year marks 10 years of clinical experience with 
      ADA. Long-term extension studies of some of the initial clinical trials, as well as 
      data from large patient registries, are demonstrating ongoing benefit for 
      responders. Potential side effects such as increased risk of infection, lymphoma, 
      congestive heart failure, and demyelination continue to be examined, as the 
      available data are not unanimous in showing an increase in incidence. In balancing 
      both the advantages and the disadvantages of using ADA, the drug's overall 
      effectiveness and its availability for use in patients with hepatic or renal 
      comorbidities are weighed against the high cost. ADA is expected to have a leading 
      role in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions for 
      years to come. Future studies will need to address the optimal sequence of 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics to use, combinations of 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, and head-to-head comparisons of 
      biologics in clinical trials. For those who go into clinical remission on an 
      anti-tumor necrosis factor medication, unanswered questions remain about identifying 
      the patients who can maintain the remission off all drugs, or at least off injected 
      medication. Given the cost of biologic drugs, even studies that increase the 
      interval between drug doses in well-controlled patients could provide financial 
      benefits.

TI  - Risk of Clostridium difficile infection with acid suppressing drugs and antibiotics: 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1011-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.108 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Several studies have raised concern regarding the possible association 
      between proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We 
      aimed to perform a systematic review of incident and recurrent CDI in PPI users, and 
      to evaluate the relative impact of concurrent antibiotic use, or switching acid 
      suppression to histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs). METHODS: We searched 
      MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to December 2011 for controlled observational 
      studies that reported on the risk of CDI with and without PPI use. We performed 
      random effects meta-analysis and assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) 
      statistic. RESULTS: We included 42 observational studies (30 case-control, 12 
      cohort) totalling 313,000 participants overall. Pooled analysis of 39 studies showed 
      a statistically significant association between PPI use and risk of developing CDI, 
      odds ratio (OR) 1.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-2.85, P<0.001, I(2)=85%) 
      compared with non-users. A pooled analysis of three studies showed a significant 
      associated risk of recurrent CDI associated with PPIs, OR 2.51 (95% CI 1.16-5.44, 
      P=0.005, I(2)=78%). Subgroup analysis failed to fully clarify the source of the 
      substantial statistical heterogeneity. Adjusted indirect comparison demonstrated 
      that use of H2RAs as an alternative carried a lower-risk OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.53-0.97) 
      compared with PPIs. Conversely, concomitant use of PPI and antibiotics conferred a 
      greater-risk OR 1.96 (95% CI 1.03-3.70) above that of PPIs alone. For PPI and 
      antibiotics, the Rothman's synergy index was 1.36 and attributable proportion of 
      risk from interaction 0.19, indicating an increased risk from interaction beyond the 
      effects of each drug alone. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the substantial statistical and 
      clinical heterogeneity, our findings indicate a probable association between PPI use 
      and incident and recurrent CDI. This risk is further increased by concomitant use of 
      antibiotics and PPI, whereas H2RAs may be less harmful.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections: 
      network meta-analysis of randomized trials.
PG  - 659-70
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cms029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacies and adverse effects of different antibiotics for 
      uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) have been studied by standard 
      meta-analytic methods using pairwise direct comparisons of antimicrobial treatments: 
      the effects of one treatment are compared to those of either another treatment or 
      placebo. However, for clinical decisions, we need to know the effectiveness of each 
      possible treatment in comparison with all relevant alternatives, not with just one. 
      OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacies and adverse effects of all relevant 
      antibiotics for UTI treatment simultaneously by performing a network meta-analysis 
      using direct and indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: Using logistic regression 
      analysis, we performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) published after 1999 that compared different oral antibiotic or placebo 
      regimens for UTI treatment in general practice or outpatient settings. We looked at 
      five binary outcomes: early clinical, early bacteriological, late clinical and late 
      bacteriological outcomes, as well as adverse effects. Consequently, a ranking of the 
      antibiotic regimens could be composed. RESULTS: Using a network structure, we could 
      compare and rank nine treatments from 10 studies. Overall, ciprofloxacin and 
      gatifloxacin appeared the most effective treatments, and amoxicillin-clavulanate 
      appeared the least effective treatment. In terms of adverse effects, there were no 
      significant differences. DISCUSSION: Network meta-analysis shows some clear efficacy 
      differences between different antibiotic treatments for UTI in women. It provides a 
      useful tool for clinical decision making in everyday practice. Moreover, the method 
      can be used for meta-analyses of RCTs across primary care and beyond.

TI  - Indirect treatment comparison of abatacept with methotrexate versus other biologic 
      agents for active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy in the United 
      kingdom.
PG  - 1198-206
LID - 10.3899/jrheum.111345 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of abatacept and alternative biologic 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
      (RA) and an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) in the United Kingdom. 
      METHODS: A systematic literature search identified 11 individual studies 
      investigating the efficacy of abatacept, infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, 
      certolizumab pegol, and golimumab in adult patients with RA that did not respond to 
      MTX. The clinical trials included in this analysis were similar in trial design, 
      baseline patient characteristics, and background therapy (i.e., MTX). The key 
      clinical endpoints of interest were the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) change 
      from baseline (CFB) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses at 6 
      months (24-28 weeks). Results were analyzed using Bayesian network metaanalysis 
      methods, and were expressed as differences in HAQ CFB and ACR20/50/70 relative 
      risks, with 95% credible limits (CrL). RESULTS: Analysis of HAQ CFB at 6 months 
      showed that abatacept is more efficacious than placebo [mean difference in HAQ CFB: 
      -0.30 (95% CrL -0.42; -0.16)] and comparable to all other biologic agents, in 
      patients receiving MTX as background treatment. Abatacept is also expected to result 
      in a higher proportion of ACR responders compared to placebo, with relative risks 
      ranging from 1.90 (95% CrL 1.24; 2.57) for ACR20 to 3.72 (95% CrL 1.50; 10.52) for 
      ACR70, and to result in comparable proportions of ACR responders as other biologic 
      agents, at 6 months. CONCLUSION: Abatacept is expected to result in improvement in 
      functional status comparable to other recommended biologic agents in patients with 
      RA who are unresponsive to MTX in the UK.

TI  - Trabectedin for the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer.
PG  - 69-75
LID - 10.3310/hta15suppl1/08 [doi]
AB  - The paper presents a summary of the evidence review group (ERG) report into the 
      clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of trabectedin for the treatment of 
      relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, based upon a review of the 
      manufacturer's submission to the National Institute for Health and Clinical 
      Excellence (NICE) as part of the single technology appraisal process. The submission 
      addressed only part of the decision problem and did not provide evidence to compare 
      trabectedin (Yondelis®, PharmaMar) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride 
      (PLDH) (Caelyx®, Schering-Plough) with key comparators. The submission's direct 
      comparison evidence came from one reasonable-quality randomised controlled trial 
      (RCT) of trabectedin and PLDH versus PLDH alone (ET743-OVA-301). The results of the 
      RCT were subdivided into the entire platinum-sensitive population (> 6-month relapse 
      after initial platinum-based chemotherapy) and partially platinum-sensitive (≥ 6- to 
      12-month relapse) and fully platinum-sensitive (> 12-month relapse) populations. The 
      outcomes included were overall survival, progression-free survival measured by three 
      types of assessor, response rates, adverse effects of treatment, health-related 
      quality of life and cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained. A mixed 
      treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis comparing trabectedin and PLDH with 
      single-agent PLDH within the entire platinum-sensitive population, with paclitaxel 
      or with topotecan also formed part of the submission. The RCT data showed that 
      trabectedin plus PLDH compared with PLDH monotherapy had a significant effect on 
      overall survival only within the partially platinum-sensitive subgroup. PFS results 
      reported by the independent radiologists showed significant effects in favour of the 
      trabectedin and PLDH arm for the entire and partially platinum-sensitive populations 
      only. Rates of grade 3 and 4 adverse events were mostly higher in the trabectedin 
      and PLDH arm than in the PLDH alone arm. There were several issues regarding the 
      undertaking of the MTC, and thus the data were not considered robust. Furthermore, 
      the ERG did not believe the MTC to be necessary to answer the decision problem. The 
      manufacturer submitted a de novo cost-effectiveness model. The main analysis 
      compared trabectedin in combination with PLDH versus paclitaxel, topotecan and PLDH 
      (each as monotherapy) in the entire platinum-sensitive population, using results 
      estimated from the MTC. Additional analyses were presented comparing trabectedin in 
      combination with PLDH versus PLDH monotherapy using direct evidence from the OVA-301 
      trial for the fully, partially and entire platinum-sensitive populations. The cost 
      per QALY gained for trabectedin in combination with PLDH versus PLDH monotherapy was 
      estimated to be £ 70,076 in the main analysis. In the additional analyses, the cost 
      per QALY gained for trabectedin in combination with PLDH versus PLDH monotherapy was 
      £ 94,832, £ 43,996 and £ 31,092 for the entire, partially and fully 
      platinum-sensitive populations, respectively. Additional work was undertaken by the 
      ERG using patient-level data and amending some assumptions to provide a better 
      statistical fit to the Kaplan-Meier data than the exponential distribution assumed 
      by the manufacturer. The ERG base-case estimate of the cost per QALY of trabectedin 
      in combination with PLDH ranged from £46,503 to £54,607 in the partially 
      platinum-sensitive population. At the time of writing, trabectedin in combination 
      with PLDH for the treatment of women with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer 
      is not recommended by NICE in the final appraisal determination.

TI  - Annualized relapse rate of first-line treatments for multiple sclerosis: a 
      meta-analysis, including indirect comparisons versus fingolimod.
PG  - 767-80
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2012.681637 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of treatments in 
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) derived their findings from either 
      placebo-controlled studies only or separately from head-to-head and comparative 
      studies. The purpose of this study is to compare annualized relapse rates (ARR) of 
      fingolimod versus all of the commonly used first-line treatments in RRMS using 
      evidence from both placebo-controlled and head-to-head studies. In absence of the 
      head-to-head data between fingolimod and the other treatments, these comparisons 
      were formed using meta-analysis techniques for indirect treatment comparisons. 
      METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      and the Cochrane Library with no limitations applied on publication language or 
      dates. Included studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating one or more of 
      fingolimod, interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, or glatiramer acetate in RRMS 
      populations. Primary outcome was ARR. Data extraction included author, year, 
      treatment, dosage, mean age, percentage females, duration of disease, Expanded 
      Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at baseline, relapses in 2 years prior to 
      baseline, trial duration, relapse-related outcome, and definition of relapse. The 
      indirect treatment comparisons were performed using a mixed-treatment comparison 
      framework. ARR was analyzed as a Poisson outcome. RESULTS: The relative ARRs, for 
      each treatment versus fingolimod, estimated from our meta-analyses were 1.43 
      (glatiramer acetate 20 mg), 1.51 (interferon beta-1b 250 mcg), 1.55 (interferon 
      beta-1a 44 mcg), 1.67 (interferon beta-1a 22 mcg), 1.93 (interferon beta-1a 30 mcg), 
      and 2.32 (placebo). None of the 95% confidence intervals for these estimates 
      overlapped unity, implying statistical significance of these findings. LIMITATIONS: 
      The key limitations of this study are the persisting heterogeneity even after 
      adjusting for covariates and the variability in outcome definition across the 
      included trials. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that fingolimod significantly 
      reduces relapse frequency in patients with RRMS compared with current first-line 
      disease-modifying therapies.

BTI - Heterogeneity: Subgroups, Meta-Regression, Bias And Bias-Adjustment
AB  - This Technical Support Document focuses on heterogeneity in relative treatment 
      effects. Heterogeneity indicates the presence of effect-modifiers. A distinction is 
      usually made between true variability in treatment effects due to variation between 
      patient populations or settings, and biases related to the way in which trials were 
      conducted. Variability in relative treatment effects threatens the external validity 
      of trial evidence, and limits the ability to generalise from the results, 
      imperfections in trial conduct represent threats to internal validity. In either 
      case it is emphasised that, although we continue to focus attention on evidence from 
      trials, the study of effect-modifying covariates is in every way a form of 
      observational study, because patients cannot be randomised to covariate values. This 
      document provides guidance on methods for outlier detection, meta-regression and 
      bias adjustment, in pair-wise meta-analysis, indirect comparisons and network 
      meta-analysis, using illustrative examples. Guidance is given on the implications of 
      heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness analysis. We argue that the predictive 
      distribution of a treatment effect in a “new” trial may, in many cases, be more 
      relevant to decision making than the distribution of the mean effect. Investigators 
      should consider the relative contribution of true variability and random variation 
      due to biases, when considering their response to heterogeneity. Where subgroup 
      effects are suspected, it is suggested that a single analysis including an 
      interaction term is superior to running separate analyses for each subgroup. Three 
      types of meta-regression models are discussed for use in network meta-analysis where 
      trial-level effect-modifying covariates are present or suspected: (1) Separate 
      unrelated interaction terms for each treatment; (2) Exchangeable and related 
      interaction terms; (3) A single common interaction term. We argue that the single 
      interaction term is the one most likely to be useful in a decision making context. 
      Illustrative examples of Bayesian metaregression against a continuous covariate and 
      meta-regression against “baseline” risk are provided and the results are 
      interpreted. Annotated WinBUGS code is set out in an Appendix. Meta-regression with 
      individual patient data is capable of estimating effect modifiers with far greater 
      precision, because of the much greater spread of covariate values. Methods for 
      combining IPD in some trials with aggregate data from other trials are explained. 
      Finally, four methods for bias adjustment are discussed: meta-regression; use of

BTI - Drug Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults: An Update
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Compare the benefits and harms of corticosteroids, oral and biologic 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for adults with rheumatoid arthritis. 
      DATA SOURCES: English-language articles from 1980 to February 2011 identified 
      through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and International Pharmaceutical 
      Abstracts; unpublished literature including dossiers from pharmaceutical companies. 
      METHODS: Two people independently selected relevant head-to-head trials of any 
      sample size, prospective cohort studies with at least 100 participants, and relevant 
      good- or fair-quality meta-analyses that compared benefits or harms of 14 drug 
      therapies. Retrospective cohort studies were also included for harms. For biologic 
      DMARDs, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCTs were also included. We required trials 
      and cohort studies to have a study duration of at least 12 weeks. Literature was 
      synthesized qualitatively within and between the two main drug classes (oral and 
      biologic DMARDs). Network meta-analysis also was performed to examine the relative 
      efficacy of biologic DMARDs and comparing withdrawal rates from placebo controlled 
      trials. RESULTS: Head-to-head trials showed no clinically important differences in 
      efficacy among oral DMARD comparisons (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide). 
      The only head-to-head trial comparing biologic DMARDs (abatacept vs. infliximab) 
      found no clinically important differences. Combination therapy of biologic DMARDs 
      plus methotrexate improved clinical response rates and functional capacity more than 
      monotherapy with methotrexate. Network meta-analyses found higher odds of reaching 
      ACR 50 response for etanercept compared with most other biologic DMARDs (abatacept, 
      adalimumab, anakinra, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab) for methotrexate-resistant 
      patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Similar overall tolerability profiles 
      were found among oral and biologic DMARDs, but short-term adverse events were more 
      common with biologic DMARDs. Adjusted indirect comparisons of biologic DMARDs found 
      that certolizumab had the most favorable overall withdrawal profile, followed by 
      etanercept and rituximab. Certolizumab had lower relative withdrawal rates due to 
      lack of efficacy than adalimumab, anakinra, and infliximab. Certolizumab and 
      infliximab had more, while etanercept had fewer withdrawals due to adverse events 
      than most other drugs. Evidence was insufficient to assess comparative risk of 
      serious adverse events among biologic DMARDs. Combinations of biologic DMARDs have 
      higher rates of serious adverse events than biologic DMARD monotherapy. Limited data 
      existed for subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Limited head-to-head comparative evidence does 
      not support one therapy over another for adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Network 
      meta-analyses from placebo-controlled trials of biologics suggest some differences, 
      including higher odds of reaching ACR 50 response, but strength of evidence was low.

TI  - Erlotinib and pemetrexed as maintenance therapy for advanced non-small-cell lung 
      cancer: a systematic review and indirect comparison.
PG  - 643-50
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2012.675880 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two new agents have recently been licensed as maintenance therapy for 
      advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by the US Food and Drug Administration. 
      This paper aims to systematically review the evidence from all available clinical 
      trials of erlotinib and pemetrexed as maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC. 
      METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed in PUBMED, EMBASE and 
      Cochrane databases. Abstracts presented at two conferences were also researched. The 
      effects of erlotinib and pemetrexed on overall survival and progression-free 
      survival were compared using an indirect treatment comparison method with placebo or 
      observation as a common comparator. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled studies were 
      included. Both interventions offered significant advantages for overall survival 
      (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo or observation. Using 
      indirect comparison meta-analysis, the relative hazards ratio of pemetrexed compared 
      with erlotinib for PFS was 0.71 (95% CI 0.60-0.85; p = 0.0001), suggested that 
      pemetrexed was superior to erlotinib in terms of progression-free survival. Although 
      relative hazards ratio for OS showed no significant difference between the two 
      agents (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71-1.08, p = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to 
      suggest that maintenance treatment with erlotinib or pemetrexed has clinically 
      relevant and statistically significant advantages over treatment with placebo or 
      observation in patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Meta-analyses: what they can and cannot do.
PG  - w13518
LID - 10.4414/smw.2012.13518 [doi]
AB  - Meta-analyses overcome the limitation of small sample sizes or rare outcomes by 
      pooling results from a number of individual studies to generate a single best 
      estimate. As long as a meta-analysis is not limited by poor quality of included 
      trials, unexplainable heterogeneity and/or reporting bias of individual trials, 
      meta-analyses can be instrumental in reliably demonstrating benefit or harm of an 
      intervention when results of individual randomised controlled trials are conflicting 
      or inconclusive. Therefore meta-analyses should be conducted as part of a systematic 
      review, i.e., a systematic approach to answer a focused clinical question. Important 
      features of a systematic review are a comprehensive, reproducible search for primary 
      studies, selection of studies using clear and transparent eligibility criteria, 
      standardised critical appraisal of studies for quality, and investigation of 
      heterogeneity among included studies. Cumulative meta-analysis may prevent delays in 
      the introduction of effective treatments and may allow for early detection of 
      harmful effects of interventions. As opposed to meta-analysis based on aggregate 
      study data, individual patient data meta-analyses offer the advantage to use 
      standardised criteria across trials and reliably investigate subgroup effects of 
      interventions. Network meta-analysis allows the integration of data from direct and 
      indirect comparisons in order to compare multiple treatments in a comprehensive 
      analysis and determine the best treatment among several options. We conclude that 
      meta-analysis has become a popular, versatile, and powerful tool. If rigorously 
      conducted as part of a systematic review, it is essential for evidence-based 
      decision making in clinical practice as well as on the health policy level.

TI  - Lapatinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer following initial treatment with 
      trastuzumab: an economic analysis from the Brazilian public health care perspective.
PG  - 173-82
LID - 10.2147/BCTT.S37003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, from the perspective of the Brazilian public health care 
      system, the cost-effectiveness of lapatinib plus capecitabine (LAP/CAP) versus 
      capecitabine alone (CAP) or trastuzumab plus capecitabine (TRAST/CAP) in the 
      treatment of women with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive metastatic 
      breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab. METHODS: An economic model was 
      developed to compare costs and clinical outcomes over a 5-year time horizon. Both 
      costs and outcomes were discounted at a 5% rate, in accordance with Brazilian 
      pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Clinical inputs were determined using indirect 
      treatment comparisons. Costs were derived from public reimbursement databases and 
      reported in 2010 Brazilian real (R$1 = USD$0.52). Clinical outcomes included 
      progression-free survival years (PFYs), life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted 
      life-years (QALYs). The economic outcome was the incremental cost per LY, PFY, or 
      QALY gained. The impact of variations in individual inputs (eg, drug cost, drug 
      effectiveness) was examined using one-way sensitivity analyses. Overall model 
      robustness was tested using probabilistic sensitivity analyses, varying the ranges 
      of all input parameters within their standard distributions. RESULTS: Expected cost 
      per patient was R$41,195 for CAP, R$95,256 for LAP/CAP, and R$113,686 for TRAST/CAP. 
      Respective LYs were 1.406, 1.695, and 1.465; PFYs were 0.473, 0.711, and 0.612; and 
      QALYS were 0.769, 0.958, and 0.827. LAP/CAP dominated TRAST/CAP for all outcomes. 
      Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of LAP/CAP over CAP were R$186,563 for LYs, 
      R$226,403 for PFYs, and R$284,864 for QALYs. Results remained unchanged in one-way 
      sensitivity analyses. In probabilistic analyses, LAP/CAP was dominant over TRAST/CAP 
      in 93.5% of simulations. CONCLUSION: LAP/CAP increases survival for women with human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive metastatic breast cancer. LAP/CAP is 
      cost-effective against TRAST/CAP (ie, produces more benefits at a lower cost) and 
      can be considered cost-effective over CAP at a willingness-to-pay of about R$290,000 
      (US$151,000) per QALY gained.

      modification.
PG  - 213-25
LID - 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.12.012 [doi]
AB  - Improvement in flow and bulk density, the two most important properties that 
      determine the ease with which pharmaceutical powders can be handled, stored and 
      processed, is done through surface modification. A limited design of experiment was 
      conducted to establish a standardized dry coating procedure that limits the extent 
      of powder attrition, while providing the most consistent improvement in angle of 
      repose (AOR). The magnetically assisted impaction coating (MAIC) was considered as a 
      model dry-coater for pharmaceutical powders; ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and ascorbic 
      acid. Dry coated drug powders were characterized by AOR, particle size as a function 
      of dispersion pressure, particle size distribution, conditioned bulk density (CBD), 
      Carr index (CI), flow function coefficient (FFC), cohesion coefficient using 
      different instruments, including a shear cell in the Freeman FT4 powder rheometer, 
      and Hansen flowability index. Substantial improvement was observed in all the 
      measured properties after dry coating relative to the uncoated powders, such that 
      each powder moved from a poorer to a better flow classification and showed improved 
      dispersion. The material intrinsic property such as cohesion, plotted as a function 
      of particle size, gave a trend similar to those of bulk flow properties, AOR and CI. 
      Property improvement is also illustrated in a phase map of inverse cohesion (or FFC) 
      as a function of bulk density, which also indicated a significant positive shift due 
      to dry coating. It is hoped that such phase maps are useful in manufacturing 
      decisions regarding the need for dry coating, which will allow moving from wet 
      granulation to roller compaction or to direct compression based formulations.

TI  - Assessing the comparative effectiveness of newly marketed medications: 
      methodological challenges and implications for drug development.
PG  - 777-90
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2011.235 [doi]
AB  - Comparative-effectiveness research (CER) aims to produce actionable evidence 
      regarding the effectiveness and safety of medical products and interventions as they 
      are used outside of controlled research settings. Although CER evidence regarding 
      medications is particularly needed shortly after market approval, key methodological 
      challenges include (i) potential bias due to channeling of patients to the newly 
      marketed medication because of various patient-, physician-, and system-related 
      factors; (ii) rapid changes in the characteristics of the user population during the 
      early phase of marketing; and (iii) lack of timely data and the often small number 
      of users in the first few months of marketing. We propose a mix of approaches to 
      generate comparative-effectiveness data in the early marketing period, including 
      sequential cohort monitoring with secondary health-care data and propensity score 
      (PS) balancing, as well as extended follow-up of phase III and phase IV trials, 
      indirect comparisons of placebo-controlled trials, and modeling and simulation of 
      virtual trials.

      randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 850-9
LID - 10.1016/j.cardfail.2011.05.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evidence of individual studies in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema 
      (ACPE) supporting noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is still inconclusive, particularly 
      regarding noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). METHODS: We carried out 
      a meta-analysis. We searched in the Embase, Medline, Cinahl, Dare, Coch, Central, 
      and CNKI databases and congress abstracts for trials comparing continuous positive 
      airway pressure (CPAP) or NIPPV with standard therapy (ST). To assess treatment 
      effects, we carried out direct comparison using a random effects model and adjusted 
      indirect comparison. RESULTS: At total of 34 studies (3,041 patients) were included. 
      In direct comparisons, both CPAP and NIPPV reduced the risk of death (relative risk 
      [RR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.93; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.58-1.10; respectively) compared with 
      ST, although only CPAP had a significant effect. There were no significant 
      differences between NIPPV and CPAP. Pooled results of direct and adjusted indirect 
      comparisons showed that compared with ST, both CPAP and NIPPV significantly reduced 
      mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.89; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.97; respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that among ACPE patients, NIV delivered through 
      either NIPPV or CPAP reduced mortality.

TI  - Raltitrexed plus cisplatin is cost-effective compared with pemetrexed plus cisplatin 
      in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.
PG  - 261-7
LID - 10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.07.011 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has 
      previously recommended pemetrexed plus cisplatin for the treatment of patients with 
      advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and WHO performance status 0-1. 
      Subsequent to this appraisal, randomised controlled trial (RCT) data for raltitrexed 
      plus cisplatin and comparing chemotherapy to active symptom control (ASC) has become 
      available, allowing a more complete analysis of the comparative efficacy and 
      cost-effectiveness of first-line chemotherapy in MPM. METHODS: An adjusted indirect 
      comparison is used to estimate the relative efficacy of raltitrexed plus cisplatin 
      and pemetrexed plus cisplatin. A cost-effectiveness model is used to assess the 
      lifetime costs and health outcomes associated with these comparators and ASC. 
      Patient level data from the EORTC 08983 trial are used to estimate baseline 
      progression and survival rates. Relative treatment effects are taken from RCTs; cost 
      and utility data from the literature. RESULTS: Raltitrexed plus cisplatin and 
      pemetrexed plus cisplatin were not found to be statistically significantly different 
      with respect to overall response, progression free survival or overall survival. The 
      cost-effectiveness analysis found raltitrexed plus cisplatin to be cost-effective at 
      a cost per quality adjusted life year of £13,454 compared to cisplatin and £27,360 
      compared to ASC. Pemetrexed plus cisplatin is dominated by raltitrexed plus 
      cisplatin as the raltitrexed combination offers marginally higher quality adjusted 
      life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs) at a substantially lower total cost. 
      CONCLUSION: Raltitrexed plus cisplatin is a cost-effective first-line treatment for 
      MPM. This conclusion was maintained across a number of sensitivity analyses.

TI  - Indirect treatment comparison of bevacizumab + interferon-α-2a vs tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors in first-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma therapy.
PG  - 19-27
LID - 10.2147/CEOR.S16118 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor bevacizumab (BEV) given 
      in combination with interferon-α-2a (IFN), and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
      sunitinib (SUN) and pazopanib (PAZ), have all shown significant increase in 
      progression-free survival (PFS) in first-line metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (mRCC) 
      therapy. These targeted therapies are currently competing to be primary choice; 
      hence, in the absence of direct head-to-head comparison, there is a need for valid 
      indirect comparison assessment. METHODS: Standard indirect comparison methods were 
      applied to independent review PFS data of the pivotal Phase III trials, to determine 
      indirect treatment comparison hazard-ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% 
      CI). As BEV+IFN and SUN have been compared to IFN, indirect comparison was enabled 
      by the common IFN comparator arms. As PAZ was compared to placebo (PLA), a connector 
      trial (IFN vs PLA) was required for the indirect comparison to BEV+IFN. Sensitivity 
      analyses taking into account real-life influence of patient compliance on clinical 
      outcomes were performed. RESULTS: The indirect efficacy comparison resulted in a 
      statistically nonsignificant PFS difference of BEV+IFN vs SUN (HR: 1.06; 95% CI: 
      0.78-1.45; P = 0.73) and of BEV+IFN vs PAZ (range based on different connector 
      trials; HR: 0.74-1.03; P = 0.34-0.92). Simulating real-life patient compliance and 
      its effectiveness impact showed an increased tendency towards BEV+IFN without 
      reaching statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There is no statistically 
      significant PFS difference between BEV+IFN and TKIs in first-line mRCC. These 
      findings imply that additional treatment decision criteria such as tolerability and 
      therapy sequencing need to be considered to guide treatment decisions.

TI  - Adverse events associated with individual statin treatments for cardiovascular 
      disease: an indirect comparison meta-analysis.
PG  - 145-57
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcr158 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins are the most widely prescribed drug available. Due to this 
      reason, it is important to understand the risks involved with the drug class and 
      individual statins. AIM: We conducted a meta-analysis and employed indirect 
      comparisons to identify differing risk effects across statins. DESIGN: We included 
      any randomized clinical trial (RCT) of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, 
      pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin used for cardiovascular 
      disease event prevention. The main outcome was adverse events [all-cause mortality, 
      cancers, rhabdomylosis, diabetes, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT), 
      and creatinine kinase (CK) increases beyond the upper limit of normal]. In order to 
      evaluate the relative effects of each drug on adverse events, we calculated adjusted 
      indirect comparisons of the adverse-event outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-two trials 
      involving 159,458 patients met our inclusion criteria. Overall, statin treatments 
      significantly increased the rate of diabetes when compared to controls (OR: 1.09; 
      95% CI: 1.02-1.16) and elevated AST (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.04-1.66) and ALT (OR: 1.28; 
      95% CI: 1.11-1.48) levels when compared to controls. Using indirect comparisons, we 
      also found that atorvastatin significantly elevated AST levels compared to 
      pravastatin (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.13-4.29) and simvastatin significantly increased CK 
      levels when compared to rosuvastatin (OR: 4.39; 95% CI: 1.01-19.07). Higher dose 
      studies had increased risk of AST elevations. DISCUSSION: Although statins are 
      generally well tolerated, there are risks associated with almost all drugs. With few 
      exceptions, statins appear to exert a similar risk across individual drugs.

TI  - Structure and host recognition of serotype 13 glycopeptidolipid from Mycobacterium 
      intracellulare.
PG  - 5766-74
LID - 10.1128/JB.05412-11 [doi]
AB  - The Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex (MAIC) is divided into 28 
      serotypes by a species-specific glycopeptidolipid (GPL). Previously, we clarified 
      the structures of serotype 7 GPL and two methyltransferase genes (orfA and orfB) in 
      serotype 12 GPL. This study elucidated the chemical structure, biosynthesis gene, 
      and host innate immune response of serotype 13 GPL. The oligosaccharide (OSE) 
      structure of serotype 13 GPL was determined to be 
      4-2'-hydroxypropanoyl-amido-4,6-dideoxy-β-hexose-(1 → 3)-4-O-methyl-α-L-rhamnose-(1 
      → 3)-α-L-rhamnose-(1 → 3)-α-L-rhamnose-(1 → 2)-α-L-6-deoxy-talose by using 
      chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. 
      The structure of the serotype 13 GPL was different from those of serotype 7 and 12 
      GPLs only in O-methylations. We found a relationship between the structure and 
      biosynthesis gene cluster. M. intracellulare serotypes 12 and 13 have a 1.95-kb 
      orfA-orfB gene responsible for 3-O-methylation at the terminal hexose, orfB, and 
      4-O-methylation at the rhamnose next to the terminal hexose, orfA. The serotype 13 
      orfB had a nonfunctional one-base missense mutation that modifies serotype 12 GPL to 
      serotype 13 GPL. Moreover, the native serotype 13 GPL was multiacetylated and 
      recognized via Toll-like receptor 2. The findings presented here imply that 
      serotypes 7, 12, and 13 are phylogenetically related and confirm that acetylation of 
      the GPL is necessary for host recognition. This study will promote better 
      understanding of the structure-function relationships of GPLs and may open a new 
      avenue for the prevention of MAIC infections.

      process. The University of Aberdeen Health Technology Assessment Group were 
      commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG); the role of the ERG being to 
      appraise the manufacturer's submission and to produce an independent report. This 
      article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's 
      subsequent decisions. The manufacturer considered that denosumab would be 
      appropriate for patients unable to take, comply with or tolerate oral 
      bisphosphonates. Comparator treatments selected for the submission were, therefore, 
      'no treatment', raloxifene, strontium ranelate, intravenous zoledronic acid, 
      intravenous ibandronate and teriparatide. The main effectiveness evidence for 
      denosumab was derived from a large randomized controlled trial comparing denosumab 
      with placebo. Given by subcutaneous injection at 6-monthly intervals for 3 years, 
      denosumab reduced the incidence of hip fracture by 40%, and reduced the incidence of 
      clinical vertebral fracture by 69%. An indirect treatment comparison was used to 
      derive adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for different types of fracture for 
      each comparator versus placebo. The RRs (95% CI) applied for denosumab were 0.316 
      (0.208, 0.478) for clinical vertebral fracture, 0.605 (0.373, 0.983) for hip 
      fracture and 0.842 (0.638, 1.110) for wrist fracture. Despite a number of concerns 
      surrounding the methodology of the indirect comparison, the ERG was satisfied with 
      the robustness of the effect estimates. The RR estimates were applied in a 
      good-quality Markov model that took account of drug costs, administration and 
      monitoring costs, costs associated with fractures, and long-term nursing home costs. 
      Utility weights were used to adjust time spent in fracture states, allowing QALYs to 
      be estimated. The base-case analysis was conducted for women aged 70 years with a 
      T-score of -2.5 or less and no prior fracture, and women aged 70 years with a 
      T-score of -2.5 or less with a prior fragility fracture. Subgroup analyses based on 
      T-score and independent clinical risk factors were also undertaken. Applying a 
      willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £30 000 per QALY, the manufacturer's results 
      suggested that denosumab would offer a cost-effective alternative to all treatment 
      comparators for the primary and secondary prevention of fractures. The ERG was 
      concerned about an assumption that denosumab would be administered in general 
      practice at the average cost of two standard GP visits a year. As a result, the ERG 
      requested some further sensitivity analysis and undertook some further modelling, 
      applying an assumption that denosumab would be provided primarily in secondary care. 
      This modification altered the cost effectiveness of denosumab versus 'no treatment' 
      (in women with no prior fragility fracture) and zoledronic acid. The NICE Appraisal 
      Committee concluded that, as a treatment option for the prevention of osteoporotic 
      fractures, denosumab should be recommended only in post-menopausal women at 
      increased risk of fracture who cannot comply with the special instructions for 
      administering oral bisphosphonates, or have an intolerance of, or contraindication 
      to, those treatments. For primary prevention, the Appraisal Committee also 
      stipulated specific levels of fracture risk at which denosumab is recommended.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of vildagliptin and sitagliptin in Japanese patients with type 
      2 diabetes mellitus: a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of randomized trials.
PG  - 665-74
LID - 10.2165/11592490-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vildagliptin and sitagliptin are oral dipeptidyl peptidase 
      4 inhibitors approved in Japan for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus when 
      adequate glycaemic control is not achieved with diet, exercise or sulphonylureas. 
      The aim of this study was to compare 12-week glycaemic control with vildagliptin 
      50 mg twice daily versus sitagliptin 50 or 100 mg once daily in Japanese patients 
      with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Randomized trials of vildagliptin or sitagliptin in 
      Japanese patients were identified from the literature. Individual patient data were 
      obtained for vildagliptin trials. In the absence of a head-to-head randomized trial, 
      a matching-adjusted indirect comparison was conducted by weighting individual 
      patients from vildagliptin trials to match average baseline characteristics 
      published for sitagliptin trials, including age, sex, body mass index, glycosylated 
      haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and diabetes duration. After 
      matching, HbA(1c) change from baseline to week 12, the primary endpoint in each 
      trial, was compared between balanced populations treated with vildagliptin and 
      sitagliptin. Separate comparisons were conducted for vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily 
      versus sitagliptin 50 mg and 100 mg once daily. RESULTS: Two trials of vildagliptin 
      and three trials of sitagliptin were identified for Japanese patients. Across all 
      included trials, a total of 264 patients were treated with vildagliptin 50 mg twice 
      daily, 235 were treated with sitagliptin 50 mg once daily and 145 were treated with 
      sitagliptin 100 mg once daily. Mean baseline HbA(1c) ranged from 7.4% to 7.8% per 
      trial. Before matching, significant (p < 0.05) cross-trial differences included 
      lower mean HbA(1c) (by 0.2-0.3%) and higher FPG (by 5-13 mg/dL) in vildagliptin 
      trials. After matching, all baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment 
      groups. Combining matched trials, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily was associated with 
      significantly greater absolute HbA(1c) reduction by 0.28% compared with sitagliptin 
      50 mg once daily (95% CI 0.15, 0.41; p < 0.001) and by 0.35% compared with 
      sitagliptin 100 mg once daily (95% CI 0.07, 0.62; p = 0.013). CONCLUSION: After 
      adjusting for baseline differences among trials of vildagliptin and sitagliptin in 
      Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily was 
      associated with significantly greater HbA(1c) reduction than sitagliptin 50 mg or 
      100 mg once daily.

TI  - Multikinase inhibitors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma: indirect comparison 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 708-16
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.05.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of multikinase inhibitors sunitinib, 
      sorafenib, and pazopanib have reported efficacy compared with results from placebo 
      and interferon-α (INF-α). To date, these drugs have not been compared in 
      head-to-head trials. OBJECTIVE: To review systematically the evidence of clinical 
      effectiveness of multikinase inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma (mRCC) and, via an indirect meta-analysis, to determine an optimal 
      treatment among these agents. METHODS: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, CANCERLIT, and Cochrane controlled trials register databases was performed. 
      All RCTs of multikinase inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib) used to 
      treat mRCC were included. The study selection, data extraction, and quality 
      assessment were performed independently by 2 reviewers, with all disagreements being 
      resolved by consensus. The effects of multikinase inhibitors on progression-free 
      survival (PFS) were compared using an indirect treatment comparison method with 
      INF-α or placebo as a comparator. RESULTS: Four studies were included. Two studies 
      examined sunitinib or sorafenib versus IFN-α, and the other 2 studies investigated 
      sorafenib or pazopanib versus placebo. Compared with placebo, 2 interventions 
      reported improvement for PFS (sorafenib: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.44, P = 0.01; 
      pazopanib: HR = 0.46, P = 0.0001), whereas only sunitinib improved PFS over IFN-α 
      (HR = 0.539, P = 0.001). An indirect comparison suggests that sunitinib is likely to 
      demonstrate greater clinical benefit than sorafenib in terms of PFS (HR = 0.47; 95% 
      CI, 0.316-0.713; P < 0.001), using IFN-α as the comparator. Sorafenib was not 
      statistically different from pazopanib using placebo as the comparator in the 
      indirect comparison (HR = 0.957; 95% CI, 0.657-1.39; P = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Some 
      multikinase inhibitors have a favorably reported PFS for patients with mRCC compared 
      with results using IFN-α or placebo. Our findings suggest that sunitinib might offer 
      some clinical benefit over sorafenib in terms of PFS. No statistical difference was 
      found between sorafenib and pazopanib treatments. However, these conclusions are 
      based on 2 indirect comparisons of single RCTs. More RCTs are required to confirm 
      these findings and investigate the clinical effectiveness of multikinase inhibitors 
      in the treatment of mRCC.

TI  - [Is it possible to compare different studies on efficacy of biologicals in patients 
      with rheumatoid arthritis? : mixed treatment comparison as a new tool for indirect 
      comparison of clinical studies].
PG  - 517-24
LID - 10.1007/s00393-011-0827-1 [doi]
AB  - Head-to-head studies as randomized, double blind clinical studies are the best 
      method for directly comparing the efficacy of different therapeutic strategies. 
      However, at the moment no such studies are available for biological agents in the 
      treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore it is only possible to 
      compare different treatment strategies by indirect comparisons, for example by 
      adjusted indirect comparison or mixed treatment comparison (MTC). The MTC is 
      accepted by European authorities as supportive clinical evidence. As with the case 
      of meta-analyses the quality of an indirect comparison is determined by the 
      homogeneity of the studies included in the analysis.A short review of eight 
      published indirect comparisons of the efficacy of biological agents in the treatment 
      of patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed that the results with respect to tumor 
      necrosis factor (TNF) blockers are similar and that there are differences in the 
      efficacy of non-TNF biological agents.

TI  - Cross-reactivity among some metals in a murine metal allergy model.
PG  - 1022-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2011.10468.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information concerning cross-reactivity among metal allergens is scarce. 
      We previously devised a murine metal allergy model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as 
      an adjuvant. LPS reduces the minimum allergy-inducing concentration (MAIC) of metals 
      at both the sensitization and the elicitation steps. OBJECTIVES: Here, we examined 
      allergic cross-reactivity among some metals in this murine model, and compared the 
      effects of ultrapure (99·99% or more) and low purity (93-99%) metal salts. METHODS: 
      A mixture of a metal salt and Escherichia coli LPS was injected intraperitoneally 
      into BALB/c mice (0·25 mL per mouse). Ten days later, metal salts (with or without 
      LPS) were challenged to ear pinnas (20 μL per ear), and ear swelling was measured. 
      RESULTS: Among the ultrapure metals tested (Ni, Pd, Co, Cr, Cu and Au), only Ni and 
      Pd cross-reacted. In this cross-reaction, their MAICs were at the same level. 
      Combined challenge with Ni and Pd at sub-MAICs (but not at higher concentrations) 
      produced an additive effect. Surprisingly, mice sensitized with low purity Ni 
      reacted to all the tested low purity metals (Ni, Pd, Co and Cr), and the low purity 
      metals were shown to contain contaminant metals. CONCLUSIONS: In our model: (i) Ni 
      and Pd (members of the same group in the periodic table of elements) cross-react 
      with each other, (ii) this cross-reaction may depend on true and false antigens 
      forming metal-protein complexes with similar spatial geometries, (iii) Co, Cr, Cu 
      and Au do not cross-react with each other, (iv) in low purity materials, trace 
      contaminant metals may be sufficient to evoke allergy, and thus (v) high purity 
      metal salts should be considered for use in clinical patch testing.

TI  - Budesonide/formoterol vs. salmeterol/fluticasone in COPD: a systematic review and 
      adjusted indirect comparison of pneumonia in randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 764-74
LID - 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2011.02685.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This analysis was designed to provide a comparison between 
      budesonide/formoterol and salmeterol/fluticasone for the relative incidence of 
      pneumonia adverse events, pneumonia serious adverse events and pneumonia-related 
      mortality in patients being treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
      METHODS: An initial literature search revealed no suitable head-to-head trials 
      between budesonide/formoterol and salmeterol/fluticasone and therefore a systematic 
      review was conducted to find randomised controlled trials providing data for input 
      into an adjusted indirect comparison of the two combination treatments using placebo 
      as a common comparator. The Bucher adjusted indirect comparison method was used to 
      calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Eight 
      salmeterol/fluticasone trials and four budesonide/formoterol trials were identified 
      as being relevant for the analyses. The proportion of patients experiencing a 
      pneumonia adverse event was significantly lower with budesonide/formoterol than 
      salmeterol/fluticasone (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.80). The 
      proportion of patients experiencing a pneumonia serious adverse event was also 
      significantly lower with budesonide/formoterol than salmeterol/fluticasone (odds 
      ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.86). However, there were too few events 
      to draw any firm conclusions on pneumonia-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results of the indirect comparison support the hypothesis that budesonide/formoterol 
      is associated with fewer pneumonia events than salmeterol/fluticasone in chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease. The limitations of the analysis are that the results 
      from a single study, TORCH, have a large bearing on the overall findings of the 
      analysis, and that there is heterogeneity in the length and the dosing of the 
      included studies, although it does not appear that heterogeneity affected the 
      reported results. Another important limitation is the lack of predefined diagnostic 
      standards for pneumonia in these studies.

AB  - Evidence-based health care decision making requires comparison of all relevant 
      competing interventions. In the absence of randomized controlled trials involving a 
      direct comparison of all treatments of interest, indirect treatment comparisons and 
      network meta-analysis provide useful evidence for judiciously selecting the best 
      treatment(s). Mixed treatment comparisons, a special case of network meta-analysis, 
      combine direct evidence and indirect evidence for particular pairwise comparisons, 
      thereby synthesizing a greater share of the available evidence than traditional 
      meta-analysis. This report from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and 
      Outcomes Research Indirect Treatment Comparisons Good Research Practices Task Force 
      provides guidance on technical aspects of conducting network meta-analyses (our use 
      of this term includes most methods that involve meta-analysis in the context of a 
      network of evidence). We start with a discussion of strategies for developing 
      networks of evidence. Next we briefly review assumptions of network meta-analysis. 
      Then we focus on the statistical analysis of the data: objectives, models 
      (fixed-effects and random-effects), frequentist versus Bayesian approaches, and 
      model validation. A checklist highlights key components of network meta-analysis, 
      and substantial examples illustrate indirect treatment comparisons (both frequentist 
      and Bayesian approaches) and network meta-analysis. A further section discusses 
      eight key areas for future research.

      direct comparison of all treatments of interest, indirect treatment comparisons and 
      network meta-analysis provide useful evidence for judiciously selecting the best

      Good Research Practices Task Force provides guidance on the interpretation of 
      indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis to assist policymakers and 
      health-care professionals in using its findings for decision making. We start with 
      an overview of how networks of randomized, controlled trials allow multiple 
      treatment comparisons of competing interventions. Next, an introduction to the 
      synthesis of the available evidence with a focus on terminology, assumptions, 
      validity, and statistical methods is provided, followed by advice on critically 
      reviewing and interpreting an indirect treatment comparison or network meta-analysis 
      to inform decision making. We finish with a discussion of what to do if there are no 
      direct or indirect treatment comparisons of randomized, controlled trials possible 
      and a health-care decision still needs to be made.

BTI - Drug Class Review: Neuropathic Pain: Final Update 1 Report
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the effectiveness and harms of anticonvulsants, tricyclic 
      antidepressants, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and the 
      lidocaine patchin adults with neuropathic pain. DATA SOURCES: To identify published 
      studies, we searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
      Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of 
      Effects, and reference lists of included studies. We also searched the US Food and 
      Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research website for additional 
      unpublished data and dossiers of information submitted by 5 pharmaceutical 
      manufacturers. REVIEW METHODS: Study selection, data abstraction, validity 
      assessment, grading the strength of the evidence, and data synthesis were all 
      carried out according to standard Drug Effectiveness Review Project review methods. 
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the strength of evidence evaluating the 
      comparative benefits or harms of these drugs to treat neuropathic pain was low to 
      moderate. Based on a small number of short-term trials directly comparing the drugs 
      in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, the 
      evidence did not support a statistically significant difference in response (50% 
      reduction in pain) or withdrawal due to adverse events with gabapentin, pregabalin, 
      and lamotrigine compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Oralpregabalin was similar 
      to lidocaine 5% medicated patchin rate of response, but resulted in more patients 
      withdrawing due to an adverse event. Adjusted indirect comparisons of 
      placebo-controlled trials suggested that duloxetine, pregabalin, and gabapentin were 
      superior to lacosamide and lamotrigine, but no difference in withdrawal from study 
      due to adverse events was found. In these analyses, differences were not found 
      between pregabalin, duloxetine, and gabapentin or comparisons of 5% lidocaine patch 
      and amitriptyline or gabapentin. Tricyclic antidepressants caused more dry mouth 
      than pregabalin or gabapentin while gabapentin and pregabalin resulted in higher 
      rates of ataxia. In patients with cancer-related neuropathic pain who were taking 
      opioids, there was no difference in pain relief with low-dose gabapentin compared 
      with low-dose imipramine. Monotherapy with either drug was insufficient for pain 
      relief. In patients with spinal cord injury, gabapentin was more effective for pain 
      relief than amitriptyline. The difference was significant only in the subgroup of 
      patients with the highest levels of depression. In patients with central poststroke 
      pain, there was no difference between amitriptyline and carbamazepine. There was no 
      direct evidence in patients with HIV-associated neuropathic pain, multiple 
      sclerosis, complex regional pain syndrome, postmastectomy pain syndrome, phantom 
      limb pain, or traumatic nerve injury pain. Evidence for comparative effectiveness in 
      patients with types of neuropathic pain other than diabetic or postherpetic was 
      insufficient to assess comparative safety. Post hoc analyses have not found older 
      age to have an impact on response or treatment-emergent adverse events with 
      duloxetine. Combination therapy with duloxetine and pregabalin; lidocaine patch and 
      pregabalin; or gabapentin with imipramine, nortriptyline, or venlafaxine may have 
      had a potential benefit compared with monotherapy, but there was an increased risk 
      of adverse events.

TI  - An adjusted indirect comparison of everolimus and sorafenib therapy in 
      sunitinib-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients using repeated matched 
      samples.
PG  - 1491-7
LID - 10.1517/14656566.2011.587119 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To date, no trial data exist comparing treatment outcomes for everolimus 
      versus sorafenib. The current analysis indirectly compares the overall survival (OS) 
      benefit of everolimus and sorafenib as second-line treatment options. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-arm sorafenib study is selected as a basis to match an 
      everolimus sunitinib-refractory subpopulation of the RECORD-1 trial. Only patients 
      with clear cell histology are included. An adjusted matching approach is taken where 
      1000 repeated random samples matched to the sorafenib population on risk score 
      distribution are produced, and a 95% CI around the mean of all sampled median OS is 
      generated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures include adjusted median 
      OS and progression-free survival. RESULTS: In all, 45 clear cell histology sorafenib 
      patients and 1000 samples of N=41 sunitinib-refractory everolimus patients are 
      considered for analysis. After adjusted matching, the estimated median OS benefit is 
      32.0 [corrected] weeks (95% CI: 22, 64) and 81.5 weeks (95% CI:78, 86) for sorafenib 
      and everolimus patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that 
      sunitinib-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients treated with 
      everolimus may experience significantly improved OS outcomes compared to those 
      treated with sorafenib. However, because this is not a randomized controlled trial, 
      the results should be interpreted as those from an observational study.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of bevacizumab plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus 
      pemetrexed plus cisplatin treatment in East Asian non-squamous non-small cell lung 
      cancer patients applying real-life outcomes.
PG  - 34-40

AB  - AIM: To indirectly compare real-life clinical effectiveness of bevacizumab + 
      cisplatin-based therapy from the Safety of Avastin in Lung (SAiL) phase IV clinical 
      trial with published evidence from the phase III clinical trial for pemetrexed + 
      cisplatin among East Asian patients with non-squamous metastatic or recurrent 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Survival outcomes were compared between 
      subgroups of East Asian patients receiving treatments of either bevacizumab + 
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy or pemetrexed + cisplatin using a matching-adjusted 
      indirect comparison approach. Patient-level data were used to derive a new group 
      with similar characteristics compared to those reported in a phase III clinical 
      trial evaluating pemetrexed + cisplatin therapy. Exclusions to the SAiL data 
      included those with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
      (PS) of 2, those with mixed cell histology, non-East Asians and those who did not 
      receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In total 1000 samples of the pre-matched 
      analysis set of the SAiL data were selected that resulted in equal distributions of 
      the ECOG PS and gender matching variables selected and evaluated for a 
      progression-free survival (PFS) outcome. RESULTS: Median PFS was longer for patients 
      treated with bevacizumab-based therapy (7.4 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      6.7-8.2) versus pemetrexed + cisplatin (6.4 months; 95% CI N/A) among non-squamous 
      East Asian NSCLC patients. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that East Asian 
      non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with bevacizumab-based therapy have a trend 
      toward improved PFS outcomes compared to those treated with pemetrexed + cisplatin, 
      even after adjusting for differences between the two trial groups.

TI  - An indirect comparison of bevacizumab plus cisplatin-gemcitabine and cisplatin plus

      cell lung cancer in East Asia.
PG  - 13-21

AB  - AIMS: To compare the relative efficacy of bevacizumab plus cisplatin-gemcitabine 
      chemotherapy (BevCG) with cisplatin plus pemetrexed (CP) in the first-line treatment 
      of advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in East Asian patients. 
      In the absence of evidence from head-to-head trials, an adjusted indirect treatment 
      comparison (ITC) approach was selected to compare these treatments. METHODS: BevCG 
      and CP treatments have been compared in their relative effects versus their common 
      comparator, the CG treatment. Outcomes from the ITC were used in a statistical model 
      to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the two 
      treatments. The non-proportional hazards log-logistic, accelerated failure time 
      model was selected as it provided the best fit. The ITC hazard ratio (HR) was 
      conservatively adjusted to match what was observed between the cumulative hazard 
      functions until the end of the Avastin in Lung trial follow-up period. RESULTS: The 
      ITC analysis suggests that patients treated with Bev-based treatment can expect more 
      favorable outcomes in terms of both PFS and OS (PFS HR=0.71 and OS HR=0.41). 
      Probabilistic sensitivity analyses of PFS and OS HR showed that HR values below 1 
      are likely to occur in 82% of patients for PFS HR and in 94% of patients for OS HR. 
      CONCLUSION: BevCG can be considered a more effective therapy than CP for NSCLC 
      patients in East Asia.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2288-11-61 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pairwise meta-analysis, indirect treatment comparisons and network 
      meta-analysis for aggregate level survival data are often based on the reported 
      hazard ratio, which relies on the proportional hazards assumption. This assumption 
      is implausible when hazard functions intersect, and can have a huge impact on 
      decisions based on comparisons of expected survival, such as cost-effectiveness 
      analysis. METHODS: As an alternative to network meta-analysis of survival data in 
      which the treatment effect is represented by the constant hazard ratio, a 
      multi-dimensional treatment effect approach is presented. With fractional 
      polynomials the hazard functions of interventions compared in a randomized 
      controlled trial are modeled, and the difference between the parameters of these 
      fractional polynomials within a trial are synthesized (and indirectly compared) 
      across studies. RESULTS: The proposed models are illustrated with an analysis of 
      survival data in non-small-cell lung cancer. Fixed and random effects first and 
      second order fractional polynomials were evaluated. CONCLUSION: (Network) 
      meta-analysis of survival data with models where the treatment effect is represented 
      with several parameters using fractional polynomials can be more closely fitted to 
      the available data than meta-analysis based on the constant hazard ratio.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of nilotinib and dasatinib in newly diagnosed chronic myeloid 
      leukemia: a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of randomized trials.
PG  - 1263-71
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2011.576238 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nilotinib and dasatinib have not been directly compared in a randomized 
      trial for the treatment of newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic 
      phase (CML-CP). The purpose of this study was to indirectly compare rates of major 
      molecular response (MMR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival by 
      month 12 with nilotinib and dasatinib treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP. METHODS: 
      Individual patient data from a randomized trial of nilotinib vs. imatinib (ENESTnd) 
      and published summary data from a separate randomized trial of dasatinib vs. 
      imatinib (DASISION) were utilized. A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was 
      conducted by weighting individual patients treated with nilotinib to match baseline 
      characteristics reported for dasatinib-treated patients, including age, gender, ECOG 
      performance status and hematology lab values. After matching, efficacy outcomes were 
      compared for patients treated with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily vs. dasatinib 100 mg 
      once daily. Patients randomized to imatinib 400 mg once daily in each trial were 
      used to assess the adequacy of the matching. RESULTS: Before matching, patients 
      randomized to nilotinib in ENESTnd (n = 273) were older, with a lower median 
      platelet count and more favorable performance status compared to patients randomized 
      to dasatinib in DASISION (n = 259). After matching, all baseline characteristics 
      were balanced across treatment groups. Matched patients treated with nilotinib vs. 
      dasatinib experienced significantly higher rates of MMR (56.8 vs. 45.9%, p = 0.014) 
      and overall survival (99.5 vs. 97.3%, p = 0.046) and numerically higher rates of PFS 
      (98.8 vs. 96.5%). Matched imatinib arms showed no statistically significant or 
      clinically meaningful differences in these outcomes. LIMITATIONS: Baseline measures 
      unavailable in one or both trials could not be matched. Adverse event rates were not 
      formally compared across trials due to differences in reporting. CONCLUSION: 
      Nilotinib was associated with significantly higher rates of MMR and overall survival 
      compared with dasatinib by month 12 in the treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP.

LID - 10.1186/1742-6405-8-14 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our goal was to illustrate a method for making indirect treatment 
      comparisons in the absence of head-to-head trials, by portraying the derivation of 
      published efficacies for prophylaxis regimens of HIV-related opportunistic 
      infections. RESULTS: We identified published results of randomized controlled trials 
      from the United States in which HIV-infected patients received rifabutin, 
      azithromycin, clarithromycin, or placebo for prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium 
      complex (MAC). We extracted the number of subjects, follow-up time, primary MAC 
      events, mean CD4 count, and proportion of subjects on mono or dual antiretroviral 
      therapy (ART) from each study. We derived the efficacy of each drug using adjusted 
      indirect comparisons and, when possible, by direct comparisons. Five articles 
      satisfied our inclusion criteria. Using direct comparison, we estimated the 
      efficacies of rifabutin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin compared to placebo to be 
      53% (95% CI, 48-61%), 66% (95% CI, 61-74%), and 66% (95% CI, 60-81%), respectively. 
      Using adjusted indirect calculations, the efficacy of rifabutin compared to placebo 
      ranged from 41% to 44%. The adjusted indirect efficacies of clarithromycin and 
      azithromycin were estimated to be 73% and 72%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate 
      estimates of specific drug dosages as compared to placebo are important for policy 
      and implementation research. This study illustrates a simple method of adjusting for 
      differences in study populations by using indirect comparisons in the absence of 
      head-to-head HIV clinical trials.

TI  - [Observation on therapeutic effect of routine acupoints plus mental 
      activity-adjusting acupoints in the treatment of post-surgical gastroparesis 
      syndrome].
PG  - 458-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of routine plus mental-regulating acupoints on 
      the head for post-operative gastroparesis syndrome. METHODS: Twenty patients were 
      randomized into treatment group and control group, with 10 cases in each. For 
      patients in the control group, transcutaneous nerve electrical stimulation (TENS) of 
      Pishu (BL 20), Weishu (BL 21) and Sanjiaoshu (BL 22) was given for 20 min, followed 
      by acupuncture of Neiguan (PC 6), Zhongwan (CV 12), Qihai (CV6), Tianshu (ST 25), 
      etc., plus abdominal TDP irradiation and pellet-pressure of otopoints; Wei (MA-IC), 
      Jiaogan (MA-AH 7), Neifenmi (MA-IC 3), Sanjiao (MA-IC 4), Pizhixia (MA-AT 1), etc. 
      For patients of the treatment group, in addition to the treatment mentioned above, 
      acupoints Baihui (GV 20), Yintang (EX-HN 3) and scalp-point Weiqu (Stomach Area) for 
      adjusting the mental activity were punctured. The treatment was conducted once 
      daily, 5 times a week and continuously for 4 weeks. Changes of the psychological 
      status including Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) 
      scores, and gastric drainage volume/d were recorded. Results In comparison with 
      pre-treatment, the HAMD and HAMA scores of both the treatment group and the control 
      group after the treatment were decreased significantly (P < 0.01), and the 
      therapeutic effects of the treatment group in reducing HAMD and HAMA scores were 
      evidently superior to those of the control group (both P < 0.05). The gastric 
      drainage volume/d in the two groups both decreased after the treatment. Of the two 
      10 cases in the treatment and control groups, 10 and 8 were cured, 0 and 2 were 
      improved. No significant difference was found between the two groups in the 
      therapeutic effect (P > 0.05), but the treatment sessions of the treatment and 
      control groups were 7.3 +/- 1.3 and 10.4 +/- 2.1, respectively (P < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: Mental activity-adjusting acupoints plus routine acupuncture (TENS, TDP 
      irradiation and o-to-point-pellet pressure) can effectively improve post-surgical 
      gastroparesis patients' psychological status and raise clinical therapeutic effect.

TI  - [Effect of otopoint-needle embedment on headache and plasma 5-HT content in migraine 
      patients].
PG  - 448-52, 473
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of otopoint-needle embedment on migraine and to 
      explore its underlying mechanism. METHODS: Ninety-two migraine outpatients were 
      equally randomized into acupuncture group and medication group. For patients of the 
      acupuncture group, one sterilized intradermal needle was inserted into E 
      (MA-AT)-point and advanced toward Nie (temple-point, MA-AT), then another inserted 
      into Nie (Temple-point, MA-AT) and advanced toward Zhen (occipus-point, MA-AT), 
      followed by fixing the needles with a piece of adhesive-tape respectively, combined 
      with Wei (stomach-point, MA-IC), Jiaogan (sympathesis-point, MA-AH 7) for migraine 
      patients with nausea and vomiting, and with Yan (eye-point, MA-L 1) for those with 
      phengophobia. Plasma serotonin (5-HT) contents before and after the treatment were 
      detected by fluorescence spectrophotometry. RESULTS: In comparison with the 
      pre-treatment, the synthetic scores of two groups one month and 6 months after the 
      treatment were decreased significantly (P < 0.01). The integrative sores of the 
      acupuncture group one month and 6 months after the treatment were significantly 
      lower than those of the medication group (P < 0.01). The total effective rates of 
      recent efficacy and long-term efficacy of the acupuncture group were 82.61% (38/46) 
      and 83.72% (36/43) respectively, being significantly higher than those [67.39% 
      (31/46) and 57.14% (24/42)] of the medication group. After the treatment, plasma 
      5-HT content of the acupuncture group was remarkablely higher than that of the 
      medication group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Otopoint-needle implant can effectively 
      relieve headache in migraine patients and upregulate plasma 5-HT level.

TI  - Mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis of altered fractionated radiotherapy and 
      chemotherapy in head and neck cancer.
PG  - 985-92
LID - 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.10.016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Different treatments have been investigated in head and neck cancers 
      (HNCs) but not all of them have been appraised using pairwise comparison. This has 
      resulted in failure to directly identify the best treatment with standard methods. 
      Mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis allows one to perform simultaneous 
      inference regarding all treatments and select the best among them. STUDY DESIGN AND 
      SETTING: We applied MTC models to the Meta-Analyses of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy 
      in HNC, which pooled individual patient data concerning more than 24,000 patients 
      involved in 102 trials. Fixed- and random-effects models, models with or without 
      consistency factors, possibly adapted to multiarm trials are discussed. RESULTS: 
      Altered fractionated concomitant chemoradiotherapy (AF-CRT) leads to the highest 
      probability of survival in nonmetastatic HNC. The probability that AF-CRT is the 
      best treatment is 94% with random-effects models. There was no relevant 
      inconsistency. When only the most recent trials were selected, AF-CRT and 
      concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) were the two best treatments. AF-CRT remains 
      better than CRT but with a lower posterior probability. CONCLUSION: MTC is a 
      powerful method for investigating networks of randomized trials. Homogeneity, 
      similarity of trial designs, populations, and the consistency of the network should 
      be thoroughly checked.

TI  - Comparison of certolizumab pegol with other anticytokine agents for treatment of 
      rheumatoid arthritis: a multiple-treatment Bayesian metaanalysis.
PG  - 835-45
LID - 10.3899/jrheum.100665 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of certolizumab pegol (CZP) with that of 
      other anticytokine agents indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
      with identical therapeutic indication (anti-tumor necrosis factor-α, 
      anti-interleukin 1 or 6), with the objective of determining the noninferiority of 
      CZP. METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify randomized controlled 
      trials that assessed the efficacy of anticytokine agents in combination with 
      conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) after 6 months of 
      treatment, using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, in 
      patients with RA who have shown inadequate response to DMARD including methotrexate. 
      Indirect treatment comparisons were carried out by a multiple-treatment Bayesian 
      random-effects metaanalysis. Data were analyzed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo 
      simulation. Noninferiority of CZP was assessed in comparison with a predefined 
      equivalence margin of 5%. RESULTS: Nineteen placebo-controlled studies were 
      identified: 14 evaluated the efficacy of 5 anti-TNF-α agents (infliximab, 
      etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, CZP) and 5 evaluated efficacy of 2 
      anti-interleukin agents (anakinra, tocilizumab). Every treatment showed significant 
      efficacy versus placebo in individual studies. The multiple-treatment metaanalysis 
      showed a highest OR for CZP on ACR20 response. Metaanalysis indicates that the 
      efficacy of CZP according to ACR20 response is superior to that of infliximab, 
      adalimumab, and anakinra, and equivalent or superior to that of etanercept, 
      golimumab, and tocilizumab. According to ACR50 response, the efficacy of CZP is 
      equivalent or superior to that of all other anticytokines. CONCLUSION: Results of 
      this original multiple-treatment Bayesian metaanalysis indicate that certolizumab 
      pegol is at least as efficacious as the preexisting antirheumatic anticytokine 
      biotherapies.

PG  - 516-27
LID - 10.1111/j.1533-2500.2010.00441.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis compared efficacy (pain response) of drugs that are 
      licensed or commonly used in the treatment of fibromyalgia. A meta-analysis of 
      safety measured via discontinuation because of adverse events was also performed. 
      METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 21 clinical trials to estimate treatment 
      differences vs. placebo, separately, for duloxetine, fluoxetine, gabapentin, 
      milnacipran, pramipexole, pregabalin, either of two tricyclic antidepressants, and 
      tramadol plus paracetamol. Indirect treatment comparisons using mixed treatment 
      comparisons methodology were conducted for all pairwise comparisons. Pain response 
      was analyzed as improvement of at least 30%, and separately of 50%, from baseline. 
      RESULTS: When compared with placebo, statistically significant pain responses 
      (improvement of 30% and 50%) were observed for patients treated with duloxetine, 
      milnacipran 200 mg/day, pregabalin 300 or 450 mg/day, and tramadol plus paracetamol. 
      Treatment with fluoxetine, gabapentin, or milnacipran 100 mg/day resulted in 
      significant findings for the 30% improvement in pain response. The meta-analysis 
      showed a statistically increased risk of discontinuation because of adverse events 
      for milnacipran 100 and 200 mg/day (both P < 0.001), and pregabalin 300 and 450 
      mg/day (P = 0.009 and P < 0.001, respectively). All other treatments, except 
      fluoxetine, showed numerically increased risk over placebo for discontinuation 
      because of adverse events. In the indirect comparisons, no pairwise comparison of 
      active treatments reached statistical significance for either pain response end 
      point. CONCLUSION: All eight active treatments displayed evidence suggesting 
      improvement over placebo in the treatment of pain in patients suffering from 
      fibromyalgia. Indirect comparison of active treatments found no strong differences.

      for thromboprophylaxis after elective orthopaedic surgery. We aimed to 
      systematically compare their relative benefits and harms through meta-analysis, and 
      adjusted indirect comparison. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, trial registries 
      and regulatory documents through May 2009 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 
      dabigatran (150 and 220 mg daily) and rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) compared with 
      enoxaparin (40-60 mg daily) in elective orthopaedic surgery. We used random effects 
      meta-analysis to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
      (95% CI) for the outcomes of total venous thromboembolism, VTE (deep venous 
      thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism and all-cause mortality), and haemorrhagic 
      adverse events (major and clinically relevant non-major bleeds). Adjusted indirect 
      comparison was used for the pooled RRs of dabigatran and rivaroxaban with enoxaparin 
      as the common control. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban was superior to enoxaparin for the 
      prevention of venous thromoboembolism (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43-0.73, P<0.0001), with a 
      trend for increased haemorrhage (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94-1.69, P=0.13). Dabigatran was 
      not superior to enoxaparin for prevention of VTE (RR 1.12, 95% 0.97-1.29, P=0.12), 
      and did not reduce haemorrhage risk (RR 1.10, 95% 0.90-1.35, P=0.32). Adjusted 
      indirect comparison showed that rivaroxaban was superior to dabigatran in preventing 
      VTE, RR 0.50 (95% CI 0.37-0.68), but with a slight trend towards increased 
      haemorrhage RR 1.14 (95% CI 0.80-1.64). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban may 
      be more effective than dabigatran for prevention of VTE after elective orthopaedic 
      surgery but might also slightly increase the risk of haemorrhage.

TI  - Effectiveness of valganciclovir 900 mg versus 450 mg for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis 
      in transplantation: direct and indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis.
PG  - 313-21
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciq143 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: valganciclovir (VGC) 900 mg is approved for CMV prophylaxis, but it has 
      been associated with 10%-40% leucopenia rate. We hypothesize that VGC 450 mg daily 
      may be as effective as and safer than 900 mg daily. METHODS: studies evaluating 
      valganciclovir 900 mg and 450 mg daily against controls were evaluated. Direct 
      comparisons were performed by random-effects models and indirect comparisons by the 
      Bucher method. RESULTS: twelve trials with VGC 900 mg (1543 patients) and 8 trials 
      with VGC 450 mg (1531 patients) were included. The risk of CMV disease with VGC 900 
      mg versus controls was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI], .64-1.76; P = .81; 
      I2=29%) and with VGC 450 mg vs controls .77 (95%CI, .49-1.18; P = .23; I2=24%). The 
      risk of leucopenia was 5.24 (2.09-13.15; P = .0004; I2=44%) for VGC 900 mg versus 
      controls and 1.58 (.96-2.61; P = .07; I2=36%) for VGC 450 mg versus controls; the 
      risk for acute allograft rejection was 1.71 (.45, -6.50; P = .43) for VGC 900 mg and 
      .80 (.50-1.28; P = .34) for VGC 450 mg. Adjusted indirect comparison between VGC 900 
      mg and VGC 450mg: the risk for CMV disease was not significantly different: odds 
      ratio (OR), 1.38 (.84-2.25); P = .19; the risk of leucopenia was significantly 
      increased with VGC 900 mg: 3.32 (1.76-6.26); P = .0002; and the risk of rejection 
      was significantly increased with VGC 900 mg: 2.56 (1.50-4.53); P = .0005. Results 
      remained consistent after adjustments by allograft, CMV control strategy, and 
      immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: valganciclovir 900 mg showed no superiority efficacy 
      compared to controls (ganciclovir or preemptive) and equivalent efficacy to VGC 450 
      mg (statistical power: 94% and 97%, respectively) for CMV universal prophylaxis.VGC 
      900 mg was significantly associated with 3 times increase in the risk of leucopenia 
      and 2 times increase in the risk of rejection compared with VGC 450 mg.

TI  - Effectiveness of biologic therapies for rheumatoid arthritis: an indirect 
      comparisons approach.
PG  - 39-51
LID - 10.1592/phco.31.1.39 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic 
      drugs (DMARDs) versus placebo with or without methotrexate, in treating rheumatoid 
      arthritis. DESIGN: Comparative effectiveness analysis using an indirect treatment 
      comparison (ITC) method in a Bayesian framework. PATIENTS: Adults with rheumatoid 
      arthritis who had been enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and had never 
      failed biologic DMARD therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two random-effects 
      logistic regression models, representing 6 and 12 months of treatment, were created 
      using RCTs identified in a literature search. Twenty-three RCTs (11,589 patients) 
      were included in the 6-month model and 10 RCTs (6051 patients) in the 12-month 
      model. Nine biologic DMARDs in five therapeutic drug classes were included in the 
      6-month model, and six biologic DMARDs in three classes were included in the 
      12-month model. Our efficacy end point was the American College of Rheumatology 50% 
      improvement criteria. In the 6-month model, all biologic DMARDs and methotrexate 
      were significantly more efficacious than placebo and ranked in the following order: 
      certolizumab (median log odds ratio [OR] 2.6), tocilizumab (1.7), rituximab (1.6), 
      infliximab (1.6), etanercept (1.4), adalimumab (1.4), golimumab (1.4), abatacept 
      (1.2), anakinra (1.0), and methotrexate (0.8). Of 45 pairwise comparisons, 
      certolizumab was significantly more efficacious than methotrexate, but no other 
      comparisons were significant. The rank order in the 12-month analysis was 
      certolizumab (median log OR 2.0), rituximab (2.0), adalimumab (1.4), infliximab 
      (1.4), etanercept (0.9), abatacept (0.6), and methotrexate (0.8). Of the 21 pairwise 
      comparisons, none were significant. The results of the model using therapeutic class 
      revealed that each class was more efficacious than placebo. In pairwise comparisons, 
      each class was more efficacious than methotrexate, but none was more efficacious 
      than another. CONCLUSION: Use of emerging ITC methods enabled us to compare the 
      efficacy of biologic DMARDs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the absence 
      of direct head-to-head comparison trials. Our methods enabled us to rank order these 
      treatments. Further analyses by drug and by therapeutic class suggest that biologic 
      DMARDs are similarly efficacious.

TI  - Indirect comparisons of the efficacy of biological antirheumatic agents in 
      rheumatoid arthritis in patients with an inadequate response to conventional 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or to an anti-tumour necrosis factor agent: a 
      meta-analysis.

LID - 10.1136/ard.2010.132134 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability of increasing numbers of biological agents for the 
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) offers several therapeutic options. While all 
      biologicals have proven effective in trials, very limited direct comparisons are 
      available. The objective of the present work was to compare the efficacy of 
      biologicals (anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents, rituximab, abatacept, 
      tocilizumab) in patients with RA with active disease and (i) an inadequate response 
      (IR) to methotrexate (IR-MTX), (ii) an IR to anti-TNF agents (IR-anti-TNFs) using 
      indirect comparisons. METHODS: Randomised clinical trials were identified examining 
      the efficacy of a biological agent in RA at 6 months in patients with an IR-MTX or 
      with an IR-anti-TNF. To compare the relative efficacy of biologicals, adjusted 
      indirect comparison meta-analytic methods to estimate the ORs of achieving a 50% 
      improvement according to American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR50) response 
      at 6 months were used. RESULTS: A total of 18 published trials and 1 abstract were 
      included in the analyses. In IR-MTX, anti-TNFs had the same probability of reaching 
      an ACR50 compared to 'non-anti-TNF biologicals' taken together (OR 1.30, 95 % CI 
      0.91 to 1.86). However, when compared to specific biological agents, anti-TNFs 
      demonstrated a higher probability of reaching an ACR50 than abatacept (OR 1.52, 95 % 
      CI 1.0 to 2.28), but not in comparison to rituximab and tocilizumab. In IR-anti-TNF, 
      no significant differences existed between rituximab, tocilizumab, abatacept and 
      golimumab. [corrected] CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials 
      of patients with IR-MTX, anti-TNFs demonstrated a higher probability of achieving an 
      ACR50 response than abatacept. In IR-anti-TNF, no difference was found between 
      rituximab, tocimizumab, abatacept and golimumab.

      in fibromyalgia syndrome: a systematic review with meta-analysis.
PG  - 532-43
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/keq354 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the efficacy and acceptability of the 
      antidepressants amitriptyline (AMT), duloxetine (DLX) and milnacipran (MLN) for FM 
      syndrome (FMS). METHODS: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, 
      www.clinicalstudyresults.org and www.clinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized 
      pharmacological placebo-controlled trials until 30 May 2010. Outcomes of interest 
      were symptom reduction [pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and reduced health-related 
      quality of life (HRQOL)] and acceptability (total drop-out rates). We performed a 
      meta-analysis of each drug vs placebo using a random-effects model and adjusted 
      indirect analyses of the three drugs. Methodological quality was assessed by the 
      Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Ten AMT studies (612 patients), four DLX 
      studies (1411 patients) and five MLN studies (4129 patients) met the inclusion 
      criteria. The reported methodological quality of most AMT trials was poor, that of 
      DLX and MLN were high. The three drugs were superior to placebo except DLX for 
      fatigue, MLN for sleep disturbance and AMT for HRQOL. The significant effects of AMT 
      and DLX were small and those of MLN not substantial. In adjusted indirect 
      comparisons, AMT was superior to DLX and MLN in reduction of pain, sleep 
      disturbances, fatigue and limitations of HRQOL. DLX was superior to MLN in reducing 
      pain, sleep disturbances and limitations of HRQOL. MLN was superior to DLX in 
      reducing fatigue. There were no significant differences in acceptability of the 
      three drugs. CONCLUSIONS: AMT cannot be regarded as the gold standard of FMS therapy 
      with antidepressants because of the methodological limitations of its trials.

AB  - Establishing efficacy relative to placebo is no longer sufficient for payers to 
      agree to cover new interventions. Evidence from comparisons of competing 
      interventions is increasingly important, although head-to-head studies are seldom 
      available to inform decisions. In this article, we describe the simulated treatment 
      comparison (STC) approach to incorporating 'missing arms' into an existing trial. 
      This approach yields a simulated head-to-head trial and can address many of the 
      differences among source trials. It provides inputs for economic models and can 
      inform decision makers until actual trial data are available. A simulation is 
      constructed to replicate an index trial, including enrolment, randomization and 
      follow-up of patients. The simulation is driven by predictive equations derived from 
      the index trial. Separate data for the comparators are used to calibrate the index 
      equations to reflect the alternative interventions. The simulation is used to add 
      the missing arms to the index trial and estimate the results that would have been 
      obtained in a head-to-head trial. The STC can also be used to estimate results in 
      various settings and populations and to explore variations in the trial design. An 
      STC offers a way to derive comparative effectiveness in the absence of direct trial 
      evidence and a platform to test design features that may help in planning future 
      head-to-head studies.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness without head-to-head trials: a method for 
      matching-adjusted indirect comparisons applied to psoriasis treatment with 
      adalimumab or etanercept.
PG  - 935-45
LID - 10.2165/11538370-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - The absence of head-to-head trials is a common challenge in comparative 
      effectiveness research and health technology assessment. Indirect cross-trial 
      treatment comparisons are possible, but can be biased by cross-trial differences in 
      patient characteristics. Using only published aggregate data, adjustment for such 
      biases may be impossible. Although individual patient data (IPD) would permit 
      adjustment, they are rarely available for all trials. However, many researchers have 
      the opportunity to access IPD for trials of one treatment, a new drug for example, 
      but only aggregate data for trials of comparator treatments. We propose a method 
      that leverages all available data in this setting by adjusting average patient 
      characteristics in trials with IPD to match those reported for trials without IPD. 
      Treatment outcomes, including continuous, categorical and censored time-to-event 
      outcomes, can then be compared across balanced trial populations. The proposed 
      method is illustrated by a comparison of adalimumab and etanercept for the treatment 
      of psoriasis. IPD from trials of adalimumab versus placebo (n = 1025) were 
      re-weighted to match the average baseline characteristics reported for a trial of 
      etanercept versus placebo (n = 330). Re-weighting was based on the estimated 
      propensity of enrolment in the adalimumab versus etanercept trials. Before matching, 
      patients in the adalimumab trials had lower mean age, greater prevalence of 
      psoriatic arthritis, less prior use of systemic treatment or phototherapy, and a 
      smaller mean percentage of body surface area affected than patients in the 
      etanercept trial. After matching, these and all other available baseline 
      characteristics were well balanced across trials. Symptom improvements of ≥75% and 
      ≥90% (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score at week 12) 
      were experienced by an additional 17.2% and 14.8% of adalimumab-treated patients 
      compared with the matched etanercept-treated patients (respectively, both p < 
      0.001). Mean percentage PASI score improvements from baseline were also greater for 
      adalimumab than for etanercept at weeks 4, 8 and 12 (all p < 0.05). Matching 
      adjustment ensured that this indirect comparison was not biased by differences in 
      mean baseline characteristics across trials, supporting the conclusion that 
      adalimumab was associated with significantly greater symptom reduction than 
      etanercept for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.

TI  - Adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis of prasugrel versus ticagrelor for 
      patients with acute coronary syndromes.
PG  - 325-31
LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2010.08.035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clopidogrel is beneficial after ACS. Recent data suggest the superiority 
      of prasugrel or ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. However, there is no 
      comparison of prasugrel vs. ticagrelor. We performed an adjusted indirect 
      meta-analysis comparing prasugrel vs. ticagrelor for acute coronary syndromes 
      (ACSs). METHODS: Randomized trials were searched in PubMed. The primary end-point 
      was the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. Odds ratios (OR) 
      were computed (95% confidence intervals). RESULTS: Three trial (32,893) patients 
      were included. Overall, either prasugrel or ticagrelor appeared significantly 
      superior to clopidogrel for the 12-month risk of death, MI or stroke (OR=0.83 
      [0.77-0.89], p<0.001), death (OR=0.83 [0.74-0.93], p=0.001), MI (OR=0.79 
      [0.73-0.86], p<0.001), and stent thrombosis (OR=0.61 [0.51-0.74], p<0.001), without 
      any significant difference in stroke or major bleeding (both p>0.05), despite more 
      frequent drug discontinuation (OR=1.12 [1.05-1.19], p<0.001). Head-to-head 
      comparison of prasugrel vs. ticagrelor showed no significant differences in overall 
      death, MI, stroke, or their composite (all p>0.05). Prasugrel was associated with a 
      significantly lower risk of stent thrombosis (OR=0.64 [0.43-0.93], p=0.020). 
      Ticagrelor was associated with a significantly lower risk of any major bleeding 
      (OR=1.43 [1.10-1.85], p=0.007), and major bleeding associated with bypass grafting 
      (OR=4.30 [1.73-10.6], p=0.002). However, the more clinically relevant risk of major 
      bleeding not related to bypass surgery was similar with either prasugrel or 
      ticagrelor (OR=1.06 [0.77-1.45], p=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Prasugrel and ticagrelor are 
      superior to clopidogrel for ACS. Head-to-head comparison suggests similar efficacy 
      and safety of prasugrel and ticagrelor, but prasugrel appears more protective from 
      stent thrombosis, while causing more bleedings.

TI  - Allergy-inducing nickel concentration is lowered by lipopolysaccharide at both the 
      sensitization and elicitation steps in a murine model.
PG  - 356-62
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2010.10016.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nickel (Ni) is the major cause of contact allergy. We previously found 
      that lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a cell-surface component of gram-negative bacteria) 
      markedly promotes Ni allergy in a murine model. Establishing the minimum 
      concentration or amount of Ni needed to induce allergic responses may help us to 
      prevent or reduce such responses. OBJECTIVES: Using the above murine model, we 
      examined the influence of LPS on the minimum allergy-inducing concentrations of Ni 
      (Ni-MAICs) at the sensitization step and at the elicitation step. METHODS: BALB/c 
      mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture containing various 
      concentrations of LPS and NiCl(2). Ten days later, their ear pinnas were challenged 
      intradermally with a mixture containing various concentrations of LPS and NiCl(2), 
      and ear swelling was measured. RESULTS: Without LPS, the Ni-MAICs at the 
      sensitization and elicitation steps were around 1×10(-2) mol L(-1) and 1×10(-5) mol 
      L(-1) , respectively. Sensitization with NiCl(2) + LPS did not alter the value at 
      elicitation. Surprisingly, LPS markedly reduced these Ni-MAICs (to around 1×10(-6) 
      molL(-1) at sensitization, with 25 μg mL(-1) LPS, and 1×10(-12) mol L(-1) at 
      elicitation, with 0·5 μg mL(-1) LPS). The effect of LPS depended on its 
      concentration and the timing of its injection. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest 
      that: (i) Ni-MAIC is higher at sensitization than at elicitation; (ii) once 
      sensitization is established, Ni allergy can easily be induced by a low 
      concentration of Ni; and (iii) a bacterial milieu or infection may greatly 
      facilitate the establishment and elicitation of Ni allergy.

TI  - Effectiveness of bevacizumab- and pemetrexed-cisplatin treatment for patients with 
      advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - S4-10
LID - 10.1016/S0169-5002(10)70132-X [doi]
AB  - The new targeted agent bevacizumab in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine, 
      and a third generation chemotherapy, pemetrexed, combined with cisplatin, are 
      approved as first-line treatment for patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As no head-to-head comparison of these treatments exists, 
      this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of the two treatments using an 
      indirect treatment comparison approach. An indirect comparison on progression-free 
      survival (PFS) was performed for two relevant randomised controlled trials using a 
      well-accepted adjusted indirect comparison method. The results were used in a 
      statistical disease model (Markov model) to extrapolate the long-term effectiveness 
      of the two treatments. A hazard ratio of 0.83 for PFS for bevacizumab plus cisplatin 
      and gemcitabine, was calculated suggesting that this treatment is associated with a 
      17% lower risk of disease progression and death compared with pemetrexed plus 
      cisplatin treatment. The Markov model predicted that bevacizumab plus cisplatin and 
      gemcitabine resulted in 2.5 months additional PFS and overall survival compared with 
      pemetrexed plus cisplatin. Based on this analysis bevacizumab plus cisplatin and 
      gemcitabine is more effective than pemetrexed plus cisplatin for patients with 
      advanced non-squamous NSCLC and should be considered as one of the preferred 
      targeted treatments of choice for these patients.

TI  - Hysterectomy, endometrial destruction, and levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine 
      system (Mirena) for heavy menstrual bleeding: systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      data from individual patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of hysterectomy, endometrial 
      destruction (both "first generation" hysteroscopic and "second generation" 
      non-hysteroscopic techniques), and the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system 
      (Mirena) in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of data 
      from individual patients, with direct and indirect comparisons made on the primary 
      outcome measure of patients' dissatisfaction. DATA SOURCES: Data were sought from 
      the 30 randomised controlled trials identified after a comprehensive search of the 
      Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases, reference lists, and 
      contact with experts. Raw data were available from 2814 women randomised into 17 
      trials (seven trials including 1359 women for first v second generation endometrial 
      destruction; six trials including 1042 women for hysterectomy v first generation 
      endometrial destruction; one trial including 236 women for hysterectomy v Mirena; 
      three trials including 177 women for second generation endometrial destruction v 
      Mirena). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials 
      comparing hysterectomy, first and second generation endometrial destruction, and 
      Mirena for women with heavy menstrual bleeding unresponsive to other medical 
      treatment. RESULTS: At around 12 months, more women were dissatisfied with outcome 
      with first generation hysteroscopic techniques than with hysterectomy (13% v 5%; 
      odds ratio 2.46, 95% confidence interval 1.54 to 3.9, P<0.001), but hospital stay 
      (weighted mean difference 3.0 days, 2.9 to 3.1 days, P<0.001) and time to resumption 
      of normal activities (5.2 days, 4.7 to 5.7 days, P<0.001) were longer for 
      hysterectomy. Unsatisfactory outcomes were comparable with first and second 
      generation techniques (odds ratio 1.2, 0.9 to 1.6, P=0.2), although second 
      generation techniques were quicker (weighted mean difference 14.5 minutes, 13.7 to 
      15.3 minutes, P<0.001) and women recovered sooner (0.48 days, 0.20 to 0.75 days, 
      P<0.001), with fewer procedural complications. Indirect comparison suggested more 
      unsatisfactory outcomes with second generation techniques than with hysterectomy 
      (11% v 5%; odds ratio 2.3, 1.3 to 4.2, P=0.006). Similar estimates were seen when 
      Mirena was indirectly compared with hysterectomy (17% v 5%; odds ratio 2.2, 0.9 to 
      5.3, P=0.07), although this comparison lacked power because of the limited amount of 
      data available for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: More women are dissatisfied after 
      endometrial destruction than after hysterectomy. Dissatisfaction rates are low after 
      all treatments, and hysterectomy is associated with increased length of stay in 
      hospital and a longer recovery period. Definitive evidence on effectiveness of 
      Mirena compared with more invasive procedures is lacking.

TI  - Pemetrexed for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small 
      cell lung cancer.
PG  - 47-53
LID - 10.3310/hta14Suppl1/07 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a summary of the evidence review group (ERG) report into the 
      clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pemetrexed for the first-line 
      treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in 
      accordance with the licensed indication, based upon the evidence submission from Eli 
      Lilly Ltd to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as 
      part of the single technology appraisal process. The majority of the efficacy 
      evidence described in the manufacturer's submission is derived from a phase III 
      open-label randomised controlled trial (RCT) known as the JMDB trial. The trial 
      achieved its primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of 
      pemetrexed/cisplatin to gemcitabine/cisplatin for overall survival in all patients 
      with NSCLC. Because no other studies were found comparing pemetrexed/cisplatin with 
      any other relevant comparator, additional efficacy evidence was presented from two 
      phase III RCTs comparing gemcitabine/cisplatin with gemcitabine/carboplatin and 
      docetaxel/cisplatin. The manufacturer's submission reported from its indirect 
      comparisons' analysis that median overall survival and progression-free survival and 
      tumour response rates were more favourable for pemetrexed/cisplatin than for any 
      other comparator. The manufacturer did not identify any published cost-effectiveness 
      analyses of pemetrexed for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC. 
      Therefore economic evidence was derived solely from a de novo economic model 
      developed by the manufacturer. A Markov model was developed to evaluate the 
      cost-effectiveness of pemetrexed/cisplatin compared to gemcitabine/cisplatin, 
      docetaxel/cisplatin and gemcitabine/carboplatin. The clinical data used in the 
      economic evaluation were primarily generated from the JMDB trial, with additional 
      data from the two further trials used in the indirect comparisons analysis. The ERG 
      identified a series of problems with this economic model. As a result, three 
      different versions of the model were submitted to NICE and considered by the ERG. 
      The ICERs estimated by this final version of the model ranged from 8056 pounds to 
      33,065 pounds per QALY, depending on the comparator, the population and the 
      application of a continuation rule. The ERG considered that the model required 
      extensive modification and redesign, and should be subjected to thorough validation 
      against the JMDB trial results. A full quality audit was also required as it was 
      likely that further model inconsistencies may be present that had not yet been 
      identified. The manufacturer subsequently included evidence in the form of three 
      cost effectiveness analyses (two models and an 'in-trial' analysis), stating that a 
      thorough validation process had been followed according to the NICE request. The 
      very short time available to the ERG to consider the new evidence precluded a 
      comprehensive assessment. Instead, the ERG chose to present a simple exploratory 
      analysis combining its own survival projections with key cost estimates obtained 
      from the JMDB trial individual patient data. Compared to gemcitabine, this resulted 
      in ICERs ranging from 17,162 pounds to 30,142 pounds per QALY, depending on the 
      patient population, the maximum number of cycles of chemotherapy and whether a cycle 
      based efficacy adjustment was applied or not. The guidance issued by NICE in 
      September 2009 states that pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is recommended 
      as an option for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
      metastatic NSCLC only if the histology of the tumour has been confirmed as 
      adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and harms of duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin in 
      fibromyalgia syndrome.
PG  - 505-21
LID - 10.1016/j.jpain.2010.01.002 [doi]
AB  - Duloxetine (DLX), milnacipran (MLN), and pregabalin (PGB) are the only drugs 
      licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fibromyalgia syndrome 
      (FMS). Evidence on the comparative benefits and harms is still accruing. The authors 
      searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and sought 
      unpublished data from the databases of FDA, US National Institutes for Health, and 
      Industry through May 2009 for randomized controlled trials. Outcomes of interest 
      were symptom reduction (pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, reduced 
      health-related quality of life), and adverse events. 17 studies with 7,739 patients 
      met the inclusion criteria. The 3 drugs were superior to placebo except DLX for 
      fatigue, MLN for sleep disturbance, and PGB for depressed mood. Adjusted indirect 
      comparisons indicated no significant differences for 30% pain relief and dropout 
      rates due to adverse events between the 3 drugs. Significant differences in average 
      symptom reduction were found: DLX and PGB were superior to MLN in reduction of pain 
      and sleep disturbances. DLX was superior to MLN and PGB in reducing depressed mood. 
      MLN and PGB were superior to DLX in reducing fatigue. The risk of headache and 
      nausea with DLX and MLN was higher compared with PGB. The risk of diarrhea was 
      higher with DLX compared to MLN and PGB. There is evidence for the short-term (up to 
      6 months) efficacy of DLX, MLN, and PGB. Differences with regard to the occurrence 
      of the key symptoms of FMS and to drug-specific adverse events may be relevant for 
      the choice of medication. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents comparative data on the 
      efficacy and harms of duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin in fibromyalgia 
      syndrome. The results can help clinicians in choosing medication since the 3 drugs 
      have different effects on the key symptoms of fibromyalgia syndrome and differences 
      in side effects, contraindications, and warnings.

TI  - Controlling ecological bias in evidence synthesis of trials reporting on collapsed 
      and overlapping covariate categories.
PG  - 1340-56
LID - 10.1002/sim.3869 [doi]
AB  - Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials based on aggregated data is vulnerable 
      to ecological bias if trial results are pooled over covariates that influence the 
      outcome variable, even when the covariate does not modify the treatment effect, or 
      is not associated with the treatment. This paper shows how, when trial results are 
      aggregated over different levels of covariates, the within-study covariate 
      distribution, and the effects of both covariates and treatments can be 
      simultaneously estimated, and ecological bias reduced. Bayesian Markov chain Monte 
      Carlo methods are used. The method is applied to a mixed treatment comparison 
      evidence synthesis of six alternative approaches to post-stroke inpatient care. 
      Results are compared with a model using only the stratified covariate data 
      available, where each stratum is treated as a separate trial, and a model using 
      fully aggregated data, where no covariate data are used.

      ablation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Percutaneous ethanol injection 
      (PEI) is less frequently used, and percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI) has been 
      mostly abandoned. Robust evidence showing benefit of one therapy versus another is 
      lacking. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence comparing RFA, PEI and PAI using 
      meta-analytical techniques. METHODS: Literature search was undertaken until December 
      2008 to identify comparative studies evaluating survival, recurrence, complete 
      necrosis of tumour and complications. Only randomized clinical trials and 
      quasi-randomized studies were included. Adjusted indirect comparisons were made when 
      direct comparative studies were insufficient. RESULTS: Eight studies were 
      identified: RFA vs. PEI (n=5), PAI vs. PEI (n=2) and RFA vs. PAI vs. PEI (n=1) 
      including 1035 patients with nine comparisons. RFA was superior to PEI for survival 
      (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35-0.78; p=0.001), complete necrosis of tumour and local 
      recurrence. For tumours 2 cm RFA was not significantly better than PEI. PAI did not 
      differ significantly from PEI for survival (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.23-1.33; p=0.18), and 
      local recurrence but required less sessions. PAI had similar outcomes, except local 
      recurrence, to RFA in the direct and indirect comparison. CONCLUSIONS: RFA seems to 
      be a superior ablative therapy than PEI for HCC, particularly for tumours >2 cm. PAI 
      did not differ significantly from PEI for all the outcomes evaluated. RFA and PAI 
      have similar survival rates. For tumours 2 cm outcome benefits comparing RFA and PEI 
      are similar. PAI needs re-evaluation versus both PEI and RFA for tumours 2 cm.

TI  - Effect of drug-eluting stents in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial 
      infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a meta-analysis of 
      randomised trials and an adjusted indirect comparison.
PG  - 853-60

AB  - AIMS: The role of drug-eluting stent (DES) remains an unsettled issue in patients 
      with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Therefore, we performed a 
      meta-analysis of randomised trials to evaluate the clinical outcome of DES as 
      compared with bare-metal stent (BMS) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We undertook a literature search until July 2009. Thirteen 
      clinical trials met inclusion criteria, with 7,244 patients enrolled. Up to 1-year, 
      patients treated with DES as compared with BMS experienced less target-vessel 
      revascularisation (TVR) (5.11% versus 11.19% respectively, p<0.00001) and recurrent 
      myocardial infarction rates (3.03% versus 3.70% respectively, p=0.02). In addition, 
      no significant differences were found in terms of cardiac death (2.80% versus 3.52%, 
      p=0.21) and stent thrombosis (2.65% versus 2.76%, p=0.37). Using the adjusted 
      indirect comparison, a significant difference between sirolimus- and 
      paclitaxel-eluting stent was found when TVR was evaluated (OR [95% CI] =0.59 
      [0.40-0.89], p=0.01), without differences in other clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In patients undergoing PCI for STEMI, treatment with DES is associated with 
      decreased TVR and myocardial infarction rates, without increasing cardiac death or 
      stent thrombosis occurrence. Sirolimus-eluting stent is associated with a greater 
      TVR reduction as compared to paclitaxel-eluting stent.

TI  - Meta-analysis as the core of evidence-based behavioral medicine: tools and pitfalls 
      of a statistical approach.
PG  - 145-50
LID - 10.1097/YCO.0b013e328336666b [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Meta-analyses have a significant impact on clinical 
      decision-making. In behavioral medicine, they are regularly used to derive clinical 
      practice guidelines. Owing to an increasing complexity of data integration methods 
      used, their interpretation has become a challenge to clinicians and researchers. 
      This review aims to provide an accessible introduction to recent advances in the 
      methodology and reporting style of quantitative reviews within the field of 
      behavioral medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: Meta-analytical findings are sensitive to the 
      precise methods used. State-of-the-art criteria for reporting of clinical trials and 
      meta-analyses have been put forward. Further adaptations of these criteria result 
      from recent meta-analyses of the placebo effect in clinical trials. There is a need 
      to carefully develop and evaluate methods to deal with patient dropout and missing 
      data. Useful methods to evaluate diagnostic test accuracy and meta-analytically 
      evaluate direct and indirect treatment comparisons have recently been developed. 
      SUMMARY: In the interdisciplinary field of behavioral medicine, meta-analyses are 
      applied to evaluate interventions, diagnostic instruments, and procedures, and to 
      derive evidence-based treatment recommendations. Criteria to improve reporting 
      quality and methods to control for potential biases have been adapted to meet the 
      requirements of research in behavioral medicine today.
