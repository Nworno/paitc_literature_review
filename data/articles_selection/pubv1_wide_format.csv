We introduce several multivariate data analysis methods to  assess the appropriateness of MAIC for a given set of baseline characteristics.  These methods focus on comparing the baseline variables used in the matching of a  study that provides the summary statistics or aggregated data (AD) and a study that  provides individual patient level data (IPD). The methods identify situations when  no numerical solutions are possible with the MAIC method. This helps to avoid  misleading results being produced. Moreover, it has been observed that sometimes  contradicting results are reported by two sets of MAIC analyses produced by two  teams, each having their own IPD and applying MAIC using the AD published by the  other team. We show that an intrinsic property of the MAIC estimated weights can be  a contributing factor for this phenomenon.",© 2022 The Authors.

Naive, indirect comparisons may be inappropriate,  as the study designs and patient populations could differ substantially.  Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC) can reduce many biases associated with  indirect comparisons between studies. To determine the comparative efficacy and  safety of lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) to tisagenlecleucel, we describe an  unanchored MAIC of the pivotal studies TRANSCEND NHL 001 (TRANSCEND; NCT02631044;  liso-cel) and JULIET (NCT02445248; tisagenlecleucel). METHODS: Individual patient  data (IPD) from TRANSCEND were available to the authors; for the JULIET pivotal  study, summary-level data from the published study were used. To balance the  populations between two studies, IPD from TRANSCEND were adjusted to match the  marginal distribution (e.g., mean, variance) of clinical factors among patients from  JULIET. RESULTS: Results from the primary MAIC showed liso-cel had statistically  significant greater efficacy than tisagenlecleucel (objective response rate: odds  ratio [OR] = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63‒4.74; complete response rate:  OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22‒3.30; progression-free survival: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65,  95% CI: 0.47‒0.91; overall survival: HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47‒0.95). MAIC of safety  outcomes showed lower ORs for all-grade and grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome, and  grade ≥ 3 prolonged cytopenia for liso-cel when compared with tisagenlecleucel;  there were no statistically significant differences detected for other safety  outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this MAIC of two CAR T-cell therapies indicates  liso-cel had favorable efficacy and a comparable or better safety profile relative  to tisagenlecleucel.

We aimed to compare  eluxadoline with antispasmodics in the treatment of IBS. Methods: We searched the  OVID Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing eluxadoline or  antispasmodics with placebo. The search was conducted from 1 January 1980, to 1  September 2020, without any language restrictions. The primary efficacy outcome was  the relief of abdominal pain, defined by a reduction of pain scores of at least 30%  from baseline. The secondary efficacy outcome was the relief of global IBS symptoms,  defined by a composite response of a decrease in abdominal pain and improvement in  stool consistency on the same day for at least 50% of the days assessed. The data  were pooled using a random-effects model. Outcome estimates were pooled by using  Risk Ratios (RRs) and P-scores. Results: Forty-two trials with 8,457 participants  were included from 45 articles. Compared with placebo, each of drotaverine,  pinaverium, alverine combined with simethicone (ACS) and eluxadoline 100 mg was  highly effective in the relief of abdominal pain, with drotaverine [RR, 2.71 (95%  CI, 1.70 to 4.32), P-score = 0.95] ranking first. Drotaverine, otilonium,  cimetropium, pinaverium, and eluxadoline 100 mg had significantly high the relief of  global IBS symptomss, for which drotaverine [RR, 2.45 (95% CI, 1.42 to 4.22),  P-score = 0.95] was ranked first. No significant difference was found between these  interventions. Pinaverium had a significantly higher the relief of global IBS  symptoms than eluxadoline [RR, 1.72 (95% CI, 1.33 to 2.21)] on sensitivity analysis.  However, no significant difference was found in the number of adverse events between  each intervention and the placebo. Conclusion: Our network meta-analysis showed that  eluxadoline 100 mg was at least as effective as antispasmodics in relieving  abdominal pain in IBS. But eluxadoline had more reported adverse events.  Antispasmodics are still the first choice for the treatment of IBS.","Copyright © 2022 Qin, Tao, Huang, Chen and Zheng.","Qin, Di Tao, Qing-Feng Huang, Shi-Le Chen, Min Zheng, Hui",Qin D Tao QF Huang SL Chen M Zheng H,NA,"Third Hospital/Acupuncture and Tuina School, Chengdu University of Traditional  Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.

METHODS: Two  patient-level datasets were used: ANNEXA-4, a prospective, single-arm trial of  patients taking apixaban or rivaroxaban who received andexanet alfa and ORANGE, a  prospective, observational study of anticoagulated patients in UK hospitals, some of  whom received PCC. Patients were propensity score matched based on demographic and  clinical characteristics. Subgroup analyses were performed by bleed type  (intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], gastrointestinal [GI], other). Relative risk (RR) of  all-cause 30-day mortality was calculated. RESULTS: 322 ANNEXA-4 patients treated  with andexanet alfa (mean age = 77.7 years; 64.9% ICH) were matched with 88 ORANGE  patients treated with PCC (mean age = 74.9 years, 67.1% ICH). Adjusted 30-day  mortality for patients treated with andexanet alfa (14.6%) was lower than patients  treated with PCC (34.1%; RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.29-0.63). In the ICH subgroup, patients  treated with andexanet alfa had lower mortality (15.3%) than patients treated with  PCC (48.9%; RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.20-0.48). Mortality risk was lowest for patients in  the GI subgroup but did not differ significantly by treatment (12.2% for andexanet  alfa vs 25.0% for PCC; RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.21-1.16). CONCLUSIONS: In this propensity  score-matched comparison across 2 independent datasets, adjusted 30-day mortality  rates were lower for patients treated with andexanet alfa than in matched patients  receiving PCC. This indirect comparison was limited in that it could not account for  several highly predictive variables including GCS score, hematoma volume, and  expected survival.

This analysis aimed to compare time to deterioration (TTD) in  QOL with transarterial radioembolization (TARE) and atezolizumab-bevacizumab, as  well as sorafenib, in advanced and unresectable HCC. METHODS: Patient-level data  from SARAH (TARE using SIR-Spheres(®) Y-90 resin microspheres [SIR-Spheres] versus  sorafenib) and aggregate data from IMbrave150 (atezolizumab-bevacizumab versus  sorafenib) randomized controlled trials were used to conduct an anchored  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). Patients with a Child-Pugh score B in  SARAH were excluded to align with exclusion criteria in IMbrave150. To identify  potential effect modifiers for adjustment, the literature was searched and  multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were implemented using SARAH data.  Patients from SARAH were then weighted to balance with baseline characteristics from  IMbrave150. Median TTD in QOL and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated. RESULTS: Four  potential effect modifiers were identified and used for adjustment: cause of disease  (viral/non-viral), macrovascular invasion, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  performance score, and alpha-fetoprotein level. The MAIC included 217 patients from  SARAH (TARE = 94; sorafenib = 123). Median TTD in QOL was 11.23 and 8.64 months for  atezolizumab-bevacizumab and TARE, respectively (HR = 1.06; 95% confidence interval  [CI] 0.75-1.50; p = 0.725). A sensitivity analysis was conducted adjusting for cause  of disease defined as hepatitis B/hepatitis C/non-viral: median TTD in QOL was  higher for TARE compared with atezolizumab-bevacizumab (19.88 vs 11.23 months;  HR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.36-1.19; p = 0.163). Sorafenib resulted in the shortest TTD in  QOL, with statistically significant differences in both base case and sensitivity  analyses. CONCLUSION: TARE using SIR-Spheres may achieve similar TTD in QOL compared  with atezolizumab-bevacizumab, as the analyses found no statistically significant  differences between these two interventions. Both TARE using SIR-Spheres and  atezolizumab-bevacizumab seem to be more efficacious than sorafenib in maintaining  QOL.",© 2022.

Transarterial radioembolization and atezolizumab–bevacizumab are two potential  treatments for advanced and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, but no clinical  trials have directly compared the outcomes of these two therapeutic options. With  the data available (patient-level data from a clinical trial of transarterial  radioembolization using SIR-Spheres(®) Y-90 resin microspheres [SIR-Spheres] versus  sorafenib and data from a trial of atezolizumab–bevacizumab versus sorafenib from  the literature), this study indirectly compared the time to deterioration of quality  of life (i.e., how long quality of life is maintained) after treatment with  transarterial radioembolization and atezolizumab–bevacizumab. The study showed that  quality of life may be preserved over a similar time period with transarterial  radioembolization using SIR-Spheres and atezolizumab–bevacizumab; also, both  transarterial radioembolization using SIR-Spheres and atezolizumab–bevacizumab seem  to maintain patients’ quality of life over a longer period of time compared with  sorafenib.

We aim to conduct the first network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing  pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (or their combinations) in  adults with ADHD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items  for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for NMAs. We will search  a broad set of electronic databases/registries and contact drug companies and  experts in the field to retrieve published and unpublished randomised controlled  trials (RCTs) (parallel or cross-over) of medications (either licensed or  unlicensed) and any non-pharmacological intervention in adults (≥18 years) with  ADHD. Primary outcomes will be: (1) change in severity of ADHD core symptoms, and  (2) acceptability (all-cause discontinuation). Secondary outcomes will include  tolerability (drop-out due to side effects) and change in the severity of emotional  dysregulation, executive dysfunctions and quality of life. The risk of bias in each  individual RCT included in the NMA will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias  tool-version 2. We will evaluate the transitivity assumption comparing the  distribution of possible effect modifiers across treatment comparisons. We will  perform Bayesian NMA for each outcome with random-effects model in OpenBUGS. Pooled  estimates of NMA will be obtained using the Markov Chains Monte Carlo method. We  will judge the credibility in the evidence derived from the NMA using the CINeMA  tool (which includes assessment of publication bias). We will conduct a series of  sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings. ETHICS AND  DISSEMINATION: As this is the protocol for an aggregate-data level NMA, ethical  approval will not be required. Results will be disseminated at  national/international conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. PROSPERO  REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021265576.",© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

However, there are no head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  between the biologics. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of different  biologics used for the treatment of CRSwNP. METHODS: We systematically identified  RCTs investigating the effects of biologics for CRSwNP. Primary outcomes were nasal  polyp score (NPS), nasal congestion severity, and serious adverse events. Secondary  outcomes included the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score, loss of smell  severity, the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test score, and the  Lund-Mackay computed tomography score. Bucher indirect treatment comparison (ITC)  was used to compare the outcome parameters. RESULTS: Seven RCTs (Bachert 2017,  OSTRO, POLYP 1, POLYP 2, SINUS-24, SINUS-52, and SYNAPSE) involving 1913 patients  and 4 biologics (benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, and omalizumab) were included  for ITC. Dupilumab presented better effects in decreasing NPS and nasal congestion  severity compared with the other 3 biologics at 24 weeks of the treatment and at the  end of follow-up (more than 48 weeks). Benralizumab was the least effective in  reducing nasal congestion severity and SNOT-22 score at 24 weeks. No significant  differences were observed between the effects of the other biologics. CONCLUSION:  Our current findings suggest that dupilumab exhibits the best efficacy and safety  for the treatment of CRSwNP.","Copyright © 2022 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

This study assessed  the feasibility of two ITCs, a network meta-analysis (NMA) and a population-adjusted  ITC (PAIC), comparing the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor niraparib in the PRIMA  trial (NCT02655016) with other 1L maintenance treatments. A systematic literature  review was conducted to identify trials using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic  Reviews of Interventions to assess differences in trial design, population  characteristics, treatment arms, and outcome measures. All 12 trials identified were  excluded from the NMA due to the absence of a common comparator and differences in  survival measures and/or inclusion criteria. The PAIC comparing PRIMA and PAOLA-1  trials was also not feasible due to differences in inclusion criteria, survival  measures, and the previous receipt of chemotherapy/bevacizumab. Neither ITC met  recommended guidelines for analysis; the results of such comparisons would not be  considered appropriate evidence when selecting 1L maintenance options in ovarian  cancer.

Population-based  data can provide insights in outcomes from clinical practice. The aim of our study  was to investigate disease-free and overall survival in a nationwide population  aligned with the inclusion criteria of CheckMate 577. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Resected  patients with stage II/III esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer  (2015-2016) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were selected from the  Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients with cervical esophageal cancer, irradical  resection, or complete pathological response were excluded. Disease-free and overall  survival were assessed from 12 weeks after resection using Kaplan-Meier methods. In  addition, to adjust for differences in characteristics between CheckMate 577 and our  population-based cohort, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison was performed for  pathological lymph node status and pathological tumor status. RESULTS: We identified  634 patients. Sixty percent of patients were diagnosed with recurrence or were  deceased at the end of follow-up. Median disease-free survival was 19.7 months and  median overall survival was 32.2 months. After the matching procedure, the median  disease-free survival was 17.2 months and median overall survival was 28.2 months.  CONCLUSIONS: Disease-free survival in our population-based study was considerably  longer than the placebo population of CheckMate-577 (19.7 versus 11.0 months).  Possible explanations are differences in characteristics, quality of esophageal  cancer care, or differential strategies for evaluation of recurrence. In the  Netherlands postoperative imaging is not part of the standard follow-up as opposed  to the standard postoperative imaging in the CheckMate 577 trial. The difference in  postoperative imaging could partially explain the longer disease-free survival  observed in our study. Quality and optimization of current treatment modalities  remain important aspects of esophageal cancer care.","© The Author(s), 2022.","Pape, Marieke Vissers, Pauline A J Beerepoot, Laurens V van Berge Henegouwen, Mark I Lagarde, Sjoerd M Mook, Stella Moehler, Markus van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M Verhoeven, Rob H A",Pape M Vissers PAJ Beerepoot LV van Berge Henegouwen MI Lagarde SM Mook S Moehler M van Laarhoven HWM Verhoeven RHA,ORCID: 0000-0001-9054-7541 ORCID: 0000-0002-3040-4626,"Department of Research & Development, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation  (IKNL), The Netherlands.

The objective was to conduct a systematic review identifying  studies reporting survival in HSCT-receiving patients and apply parametric analyses  to predict long-term survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five relevant studies  were identified. Analyses were conducted in 10 studies (n=503; ""global"" analysis)  reporting overall survival (OS) data as Kaplan-Meier curves or at patient level.  Four studies (n=217; ""subgroup"" analysis) measured OS from the point of HSCT.  Patient-level data were recreated from Kaplan-Meier curves and pooled, with six  models tested for longer-term extrapolation. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis  was undertaken involving removal of data from the oldest study cohort (recruited  between 1981-1997) to determine if the year which patients received HSCT impacted  survival compared to post-2009 data. RESULTS: Median OS and five-year survival  probability were 11.4 months and 24.4% (95% CI, 20.5-28.5%) in the global analysis,  and 12.0 months and 28.4% (95% CI, 22.1-34.9%) in the subgroup analysis. The  generalised gamma and Gompertz models fit longer-term extrapolation criteria. The  generalised gamma model predicted survival at 10.4% vs. 14.8% (15 years), 8.3% vs.  12.8% (20 years), and 6.9% vs. 11.4% (25 years) for the global and subgroup  analysis, respectively. The Gompertz model predicted survival to plateau at 23% vs.  25.6% just before 10 years. The sensitivity analysis excluding older data found  median survival increased two-fold (25.3 vs. 12 months). CONCLUSIONS: Results  synthesize long-term evidence of outcomes for HSCT-receiving patients, providing a  basis for treatment comparison. Risk of death is low beyond four years and newer  data appears correlated with improved outcomes.",NA,"Russell-Smith, T A Chadda, S LeReun, C Bajko, P Doogan, E",Russell-Smith TA Chadda S LeReun C Bajko P Doogan E,NA,"Pfizer Inc, New York, NY, USA. schadda@genesisrg.com.",eng,NA,Journal Article,NA,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,IM,NA,NA,2022/02/19 06:00,2022/02/19 06:00,2022/02/18 12:15,2022/02/18 12:15 [entrez] 2022/02/19 06:00 [pubmed] 2022/02/19 06:00 [medline],28007 [pii] 10.26355/eurrev_202202_28007 [doi],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2022 Feb;26(3):975-995. doi:  10.26355/eurrev_202202_28007.,26,3,975-995,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Teprotumumab has been compared  with placebo in randomized clinical trials, but not with intravenous  methylprednisolone (IVMP), which sometimes is used in clinical practice for this  condition. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of  teprotumumab vs IVMP vs placebo. DATA SOURCES: Deidentified patient-level data from  teprotumumab trials and aggregate-level data from literature on the most recommended  regimen of IVMP. STUDY SELECTION: PubMed and Embase were searched for  randomized/observational studies using key terms and controlled vocabulary. Full  texts of eligible articles were reviewed and cataloged. DATA EXTRACTION AND  SYNTHESIS: Conducted by 1 reviewer (R.A.Q.) and 1 verifier (R.B.), including study  characteristics, eligibility criteria, baseline characteristics, and outcomes. MAIN  OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in proptosis by millimeter and diplopia response  (percentage with ≥1 grade reduction) from baseline to week 12 in patients receiving  IVMP and placebo, and to week 24 in patients receiving teprotumumab. RESULTS: The  search identified 1019 records, and 6 through manual searches, alerts, and secondary  references. After excluding duplicates and screening full-text records, 12 IVMP  studies were included in the matching-adjusted indirect comparison (11 for proptosis  change [n = 419], 4 for diplopia response [n = 125], and 2 teprotumumab [n = 79] and  placebo [n = 83] comparator studies). Treatment with IVMP resulted in a proptosis  difference of -0.16 mm (95% CI, -1.55 to 1.22 mm) from baseline to week 12 vs  placebo. The proptosis treatment difference between IVMP and teprotumumab of -2.31  mm (95% CI, -3.45 to -1.17 mm) favored teprotumumab. Treatment with IVMP (odds  ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 0.94-7.70) was not favored over placebo in odds of diplopia  response; however, teprotumumab was favored over IVMP (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% CI,  1.07-5.03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis suggests that use of IVMP  is associated with a small, typically not clinically relevant, change from baseline  in proptosis vs placebo, with modest changes in diplopia. While this nonrandomized  comparison suggests that use of teprotumumab, compared with IVMP, is associated with  greater improvements in proptosis and may be twice as likely to have a 1 grade or  higher reduction in diplopia, randomized trials comparing these 2 treatments would  be warranted to determine if 1 treatment is superior to the other to a clinically  relevant degree.",NA,"Douglas, Raymond S Dailey, Roger Subramanian, Prem S Barbesino, Giuseppe Ugradar, Shoaib Batten, Ryan Qadeer, Rana A Cameron, Chris",Douglas RS Dailey R Subramanian PS Barbesino G Ugradar S Batten R Qadeer RA Cameron C,NA,"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.

A lifetime partitioned survival mixture cure model, which comprises  pre-progression, post-progression, and death health states, was used to estimate the  accumulated costs and outcomes in terms of life years gained (LYG) and  quality-adjusted life years (QALY). A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was used  to reweight patient-level data from ZUMA-1, the pivotal clinical trial for axi-cel,  to aggregate-level data from the pivotal tisa-cel trial, JULIET. The analysis was  performed from the National Health System perspective, thus only direct costs were  included. Sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed. Axi-cel yielded 2.74 incremental  LYG and 2.31 additional QALY gained per patient compared to tisa-cel. Total  incremental lifetime costs for axi-cel versus tisa-cel were €30,135/patient. The  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of axi-cel versus tisa-cel resulted in  €10,999/LYG and the incremental cost-utility ratio in €13,049/QALY gained. SA proved  robustness of the results. Considering the frequently assumed willingness-to-pay  thresholds in Spain (€22,000/QALY and €60,000/QALY), axi-cel is a cost-effective  treatment vs. tisa-cel for adult patients with R/R DLBCL in Spain.",NA,"Bastos-Oreiro, Mariana de Las Heras, Ana Presa, María Casado, Miguel A Pardo, Carlos Martín-Escudero, Victoria Sureda, Anna",Bastos-Oreiro M de Las Heras A Presa M Casado MA Pardo C Martín-Escudero V Sureda A,ORCID: 0000-0002-9431-4646 ORCID: 0000-0002-9525-3240 ORCID: 0000-0001-5925-0619,"Hematology Department, Gregorio Marañón Health Institute, 28007 Madrid, Spain.

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors idelalisib, copanlisib,  umbralisib and (formerly) duvelisib are indicated for third-line, fourth-line, and  later (3L/4L+) treatment of R/R FL. The objective of this analysis was to provide an  indirect treatment comparison of tazemetostat with each PI3K inhibitor for 3L/4L+  R/R FL treatment. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify  trials for idelalisib (DELTA), duvelisib (DYNAMO), copanlisib (CHRONOS-1 Part B),  and umbralisib (UNITY-NHL) in 3L+ R/R FL. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons  were conducted by weighting tazemetostat individual patient data with available  baseline characteristics from each comparator trial: age, Eastern Cooperative  Oncology Group performance status, disease stage, histology, prior treatment lines,  prior stem cell therapy, progression within 24 months, and refractory status to last  therapy. Only the tazemetostat trial included patients with grade 3b or transformed  FL, or recorded EZH2 mutation status. Primary safety outcomes included risk of  grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); primary efficacy outcomes  included objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Matched patients treated with  tazemetostat had lower relative risk (RR) for all grouped safety outcomes, including  any grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, compared with idelalisib (RR = 0.45), duvelisib (RR = 0.35),  copanlisib (RR = 0.37), and umbralisib (RR = 0.65; all, p < 0.01), any serious TEAE,  and any TEAE leading to dose reduction, drug discontinuation, or interruption. The  ORR was not significantly different for tazemetostat versus other treatments  (idelalisib 43% vs 56%, p = 0.16; duvelisib 48% vs 47%, p = 0.91; copanlisib 49% vs  61%, p = 0.11; and umbralisib 57% vs 47%, p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: In this  statistically adjusted comparison, tazemetostat was associated with lower RR for  safety outcomes versus idelalisib, duvelisib, copanlisib, and umbralisib, while  achieving similar efficacy outcomes.",© 2022.

METHODS:  Randomized trials of antihypertensives for nonsevere pregnancy hypertension were  identified from online electronic databases, to February 28, 2021 (registration URL:  https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/; unique identifier: CRD42020188725). Our  outcomes were severe hypertension, proteinuria/preeclampsia, fetal/newborn death,  small-for-gestational age infants, preterm birth, and admission to neonatal care. A  Bayesian random-effects model generated estimates of direct and indirect treatment  comparisons. Trial sequential analysis informed future trials needed. RESULTS: Of  1246 publications identified, 72 trials were included; 61 (6923 women) were  informative. All commonly prescribed antihypertensives (labetalol, other β-blockers,  methyldopa, calcium channel blockers, and mixed/multi-drug therapy) versus  placebo/no therapy reduced the risk of severe hypertension by 30% to 70%. Labetalol  decreased proteinuria/preeclampsia (odds ratio, 0.73 [95% credible interval,  0.54-0.99]) and fetal/newborn death (odds ratio, 0.54 [0.30-0.98]) compared with  placebo/no therapy, and proteinuria/preeclampsia compared with methyldopa (odds  ratio, 0.66 [0.44-0.99]) and calcium channel blockers (odds ratio, 0.63  [0.41-0.96]). No other differences were identified, but credible intervals were  wide. Trial sequential analysis indicated that 2500 to 10 000 women/arm (severe  hypertension or safety outcomes) to >15 000/arm (fetal/newborn death) would be  required to provide definitive evidence. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, all commonly  prescribed antihypertensives in pregnancy reduce the risk of severe hypertension,  but labetalol may also decrease proteinuria/preeclampsia and fetal/newborn death.  Evidence is lacking for many other safety outcomes. Prohibitive sample sizes are  required for definitive evidence.

Access to individual patient data (IPD) can be advantageous when  conducting cost-effectiveness analyses or indirect treatment comparisons. While  exact times of censoring are often marked on published Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, an  algorithm for reconstructing IPD from such curves that allows for their  incorporation is presently unavailable. Methods. An algorithm capable of  incorporating marked censoring times was developed to reconstruct IPD from KM  curves, taking as additional inputs the total patient count and coordinates of the  drops in survival. The reliability of the algorithm was evaluated via a simulation  exercise, in which survival curves were simulated, digitized, and then  reconstructed. To assess the reliability of the reconstructed curves, hazard ratios  (HRs) and quantiles of survival were compared between the original and reconstructed  curves, and the reconstructed curves were visually inspected. Results. No systematic  differences were found in HRs and quantiles in the original versus reconstructed  curves. Upon visual inspection, the reconstructed IPD provided a close fit to the  digitized data from the published KM curves. Inherent to the algorithm, censoring  times were incorporated into the reconstructed data exactly as specified.  Conclusion. This new algorithm can reliably be used to reconstruct IPD from reported  KM survival curves in the presence of extractable censoring times. Use of the  algorithm will allow health researchers to reconstruct IPD more closely by  incorporating censoring times exactly as marked, requiring as additional inputs the  total patient count and coordinates of the drops in survival.",© The Author(s) 2022.,"Rogula, Basia Lozano-Ortega, Greta Johnston, Karissa M",Rogula B Lozano-Ortega G Johnston KM,ORCID: 0000-0002-2115-8275,"Broadstreet Health Economics & Outcomes Research, Vancouver, British Columbia,  Canada.

Patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis have a low life expectancy  and limited treatment options. This research aimed to compare the effectiveness of  two recent and innovative treatments (called avapritinib and midostaurin) in  extending life expectancy and decreasing mast cells and organ damage. As avapritinib  and midostaurin were not investigated in the same clinical studies, it was necessary  to compare the two treatments using the results from studies of each individual  treatment. The published evidence used to support this comparison was systematically  searched for and consisted of four clinical studies: the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER  studies (investigating avapritinib) and D2201 and A2213 studies (investigating  midostaurin). An indirect comparison between the studies was made that adjusted for  differences in key patient characteristics.

With the immunosuppressive  effect, corticosteroids may be used to reduce the efficacy of PDL1 blockade, as well  as prevent overactive immune responses, thereby reducing the occurrence of  immune-related adverse events (irAEs). This study quantitatively summarized the  current evidence, and compared the efficacy and toxicity of therapies involving  chemotherapy plus PDL1 inhibitors plus dexamethasone pretreatment (I+C+D) with  chemotherapy plus PDL1 inhibitors (I+C) and therapies involving PDL1 inhibitors or  chemotherapy alone (I or C). METHODS: The protocol of this study was registered with  PROSPERO (CRD42021227281). By using a network meta-analysis approach, the different  treatments were compared and ranked based on their effectiveness and rates of irAEs  at the different grades. Risk rates were determined through direct meta-analysis and  indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: 12 randomized clinical trials were included  with a total of 7155 NSCLC patients. Network meta-analysis generated 15 comparisons.  The combination treatment of I+C+D showed a longer progression-free survival and  overall survival, while I+C was less toxic, and the toxicity of I+C+D or that of I+C  had been significantly decreased, compared to that of monotherapy with either drug.  According to the ranking analysis, I+C+D is consistently proved to be the most  effective therapeutic strategy, while I+C is linked to the lowest rate of irAEs,  with the rate of grade value of ≥3 irAEs. CONCLUSION: The combination treatment of  I+C+D is the most effective approach for the first-line treatment of NSCLC patients  treated with I+C, I, or C.",AJCEI Copyright © 2021.,"Li, Yanwei He, Feng Liu, Shuang Zhang, Yu Li, Ling Wang, Bin Lan, Lan Pan, Zhanyu",Li Y He F Liu S Zhang Y Li L Wang B Lan L Pan Z,NA,"Academy of Medical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Tianjin University  Tianjin 300072, China.

To date, no comparative data from  head-to-head clinical trials are available for these biologics. OBJECTIVE: An  indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of dupilumab versus each of the anti-IL-5 and  anti-IgE therapies using the endpoints of annualized severe asthma exacerbation  rates and change in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)).  METHODS: Embase®, MEDLINE®, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  (CENTRAL) were searched for studies published between January 1, 1980 and March 25,  2019. Eligible articles included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients  aged ≥ 12 years with persistent/uncontrolled asthma using at least medium-to-high  dose inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β(2)-agonist with add-on biologic  therapy. Bucher ITCs were performed to compare subgroups of dupilumab patients with  the anti-IL-5s and anti-IgE trial populations. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs were included  in the analyses. The matched dupilumab subgroups were associated with greater  reductions in annualized severe exacerbation rates compared with benralizumab,  mepolizumab, reslizumab, and omalizumab (54%, 28%, 38%, and 26% greater reduction,  respectively). A greater improvement in FEV(1) was also observed for dupilumab at  week 12 and/or week 24/52 than for the other biologics (0.06-0.14 L). CONCLUSION: In  this ITC, dupilumab was associated with lower severe asthma exacerbation rates and  greater improvements in lung function than anti-IL-5s and omalizumab.",Copyright © 2020.

This study was the first to investigate the  impact of time point-specific NMAs of osteoporosis treatments on variability in  treatments' onset of action caused by their different mechanisms of actions and  trial designs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for postmenopausal women with  osteoporosis, including romosozumab (ROMO), teriparatide (TPTD), abaloparatide  (ABL), alendronate (ALN), risedronate (RIS), ibandronate (IB), zoledronic  acid/zoledronate (ZOL), denosumab (DEN), and raloxifene (RLX), on at least 1  fracture or bone mineral density (BMD) outcome. Of 100 RCTs identified in 5  databases, 27 RCTs were included for NMAs of new vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip  fracture outcomes at 12, 24, and 36 months, and 47 RCTs were included for NMAs of  BMD outcomes at lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck to compare the relative  efficacy of osteoporosis treatments. Quality of included studies was assessed using  the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. FINDINGS: For vertebral fractures, TPTD (83.63%),  ABL (69.11%), and ROMO/ALN (78.70%) had the highest probability to be the most  effective treatment at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. ROMO/ALN had the highest  probability (54.4%, 64.69%, and 90.29%, respectively) to be the most effective  treatment for nonvertebral fractures at 12, 24, and 36 months. For hip fractures,  ROMO/ALN (46.31%), ABL (61.1%), and DEN (55.21%) had the highest probability to be  the most effective treatment at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. ROMO had the  highest probability (76.06%, 44.19%, and 51.78%, respectively) to be the most  effective treatment for BMD outcomes at lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck.  IMPLICATIONS: The importance of indirectly comparing available osteoporosis  treatments using time point-specific NMAs was confirmed because indirect comparison  results differed substantially across time points.",Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

METHODS: We conducted a pairs-comparison  meta-analysis and an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis extracting published  data from randomized controlled trials in literature databases from the inception of  each database to Aug. 31, 2021, evaluating efficacy and safety of BTX-A intravesical  instillation and BTX-A intravesical injection. We also carried out a subgroup  analysis. RESULTS: We identified 24 trials in 21 studies were included in our study,  of which 18 trials in 17 studies were BTX-A intravesical injections, 6 trials in 4  studies were BTX-A intravesical instillation. Compared with the normal saline  injection, BTX-A intravesical injections for patients with OAB and IC/ BPS can  obviously improve the symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency episode, UI and UUI,  but BTX-A significantly increased the rate of urinary retention and urinary tract  infection and increased PVR (p < 0.05). Adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis  showed that BTX-A intravesical injections was more effective than BTX-A intravesical  instillation (p > 0.05). Surprisingly, BTX-A intravesical instillation had fewer  side effects than BTX-A intravesical injections (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although  BTX-A intravesical injections of OAB and IC/BPS has been significantly superior the  BTX-A intravesical instillation, it has major side effects, but this needs to be  confirmed by more large-scale, multicenter, direct comparison randomized controlled  trials.","© 2022.

METHODS: Individual patient data (IPD) from a randomized clinical trial (RCT)  comparing the combination versus amlodipine 5 mg (EudraCT Number: 2019-000751-13)  and aggregated data (AgD) from a published RCT comparing amlodipine 10 mg versus  amlodipine 5 mg were utilized in an anchored simulated treatment comparison (STC).  The RCT with IPD was used to create models assessing how patients might respond to  the combination if they were more comparable to those patients in the RCT with AgD.  A population-adjusted indirect comparison of the treatment strategies was then  conducted, using amlodipine 5 mg as an anchor. RESULTS: In the efficacy analyses, a  total of 261 patients were included in the amlodipine 10 mg arm of the RCT with AgD;  and a total of 178 patients in the low-dose combination arm of the RCT with IPD.  Respectively, in the Amlodipine 10 mg arm and in the low-dose combination arm, the  mean age was 54.3 years-old (Standard deviation [SD] 10.6), and 57.1 years-old  (13.7); 8.7% and 18.8% of patients were diabetics; and the mean baseline SBP/DBP was  149.3 (12.0)/96.5 (4.7) mmHg, and 148.8 (8.2)/90.2 (7.6) mmHg. The final model for  SBP and DBP included the following variables: baseline SBP, baseline DBP, duration  of hypertension, age, concomitant diabetes, sex, smoking history (final model for  SBP only), and body mass index (final model for DBP only). Mean treatment  differences (standard error [SE]) at 8 weeks between the combination and uptitration  were -1.6 mmHg (1.9) for SBP; and -3.3 mmHg (1.3) for DBP. CONCLUSION: In this  indirect comparison, a more important decrease was observed in DBP with the low-dose  combination as compared to the alternative therapeutic approach of up-titration from  amlodipine 5 mg to amlodipine 10 mg.

This study indirectly compared the overall survival (OS) and  overall response rate (ORR) associated with tisagenlecleucel, using data from the  JULIET study (NCT02445248), versus historical treatments assessed in the CORAL study  follow-up population. To assess treatment effects in the treated (full analysis set  [FAS]) and enrolled (intent-to-treat [ITT]) study populations, the JULIET FAS vs.  the CORAL follow-up FAS and JULIET ITT vs. CORAL follow-up ITT populations were  separately compared. Propensity score weighting using standardized mortality ratio  weight (SMRW) and fine stratification weight (FSW) was used to compare OS and ORR,  adjusting for baseline confounders. The results indicated that tisagenlecleucel was  associated with a lower hazard of death among the FAS (adjusted hazard ratio [95%  CI], both FSW and SMRW: 0.44 [0.32, 0.59]) and ITT populations (FSW: 0.60 [0.44,  0.77], SMRW: 0.57 [0.44, 0.73]; all p<0.001). Median OS was 12.48 months (JULIET)  vs. 4.34-4.40 months (CORAL) for the FAS, and 8.25 (JULIET) vs. 4.04-4.86 (CORAL)  for the ITT populations.

METHODS: Randomized  case-control studies that compared the efficacy of various nonsurgical treatments in  PC-BPPV patients at 1 week and 1 month of follow-up were comprehensively screened.  Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to evaluate direct and indirect  treatment comparisons. We further conducted subgroup pairwise meta-analysis to  explore the inconsistency between comparisons of the Epley versus a sham maneuver  and the Epley versus the Semont maneuver. RESULTS: A total of 41 parallel,  randomized controlled studies were included. The Epley with vestibular  rehabilitation (EVR), Epley, Semont and Hybrid maneuvers were effective in  eliminating nystagmus during a Dix-Hallpike test at 1 week of follow-up (odds ratios  [ORs]: 11.41-23.8, 95% credible interval [CrI]: excluding null), among which EVR  showed the best efficacy (the surface area under the cumulative ranking curves  [SUCRA] = 77.5%). However, at 1 month of follow-up, only the Semont (rank first,  SUCRA = 76.1%) and Epley maneuvers (rank second, SUCRA = 65.3%) were effective in  eliminating nystagmus during a Dix-Hallpike test. In the pairwise subgroup  meta-analysis, for patients younger than 55 years of age, the efficacy of the Epley  maneuver was comparable to that of the Semont maneuver [rate ratio (RR): 0.99, 95%  confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.05]; for patients with a longer duration before  treatment, the effect of the Epley maneuver was equivalent to that of a sham  maneuver (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.90-1.29). CONCLUSION: Among the 12 types of PC-BPPV  treatments, the Epley, Semont, EVR, and Hybrid maneuvers were effective in  eliminating nystagmus during a Dix-Hallpike test for PC-BPPV at 1 week of follow-up,  whereas only the Epley and Semont maneuvers were effective at 1 month of follow-up.  The duration before treatments and the age of patients might contribute to the  efficacy of treatments.","Copyright © 2022, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.","Li, Daibo Cheng, Danni Yang, Wenjie Chen, Ting Zhang, Di Ren, Jianjun Zhao, Yu",Li D Cheng D Yang W Chen T Zhang D Ren J Zhao Y,NA,"Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology.

Our  objective was to compare the adjusted, lifetime cost-effectiveness between  nivolumab-ipilimumab, pembrolizumab-axitinib, and sunitinib for patients with mRCC.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3-state Markov model was developed comparing  nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib to each other and sunitinib, over a  20-year lifetime horizon from a US medical center perspective. The clinical outcomes  of nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib were compared using  matching-adjusted indirect comparison. Costs of drug treatment, adverse events, and  utilities associated with different health states and adverse events were determined  using national sources and published literature. Our outcome was incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using quality-adjusted life years (QALY). One-way  and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Nivolumab-ipilimumab  was the most cost-effective option in the base case analysis with an ICER of  $34,190/QALY compared with sunitinib, while the pembrolizumab-axitinib ICER was  dominated by nivolumab-ipilimumab and was not cost-effective (ICER=$12,630,828/QALY)  compared with sunitinib. The mean total costs per patient for the  nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib arms were $284,683 and $457,769,  respectively, compared with sunitinib at $241,656. QALY was longer for  nivolumab-ipilimumab (3.23 QALY) than for adjusted pembrolizumab-axitinib (1.99  QALY), which was longer than sunitinib's (1.98 QALY). These results were most  sensitive to treatment cost in both groups, but plausible changes did not alter the  conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: The base case scenario indicated that nivolumab-ipilimumab  was the most cost-effective treatment option for mRCC compared with  pembrolizumab-axitinib and sunitinib.","Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Nevertheless, the challenges associated with the use  of observational data can undermine the results of the studies. OBJECTIVE: To assess  the feasibility of using observational data for vaccine effectiveness studies by  examining granular weekly effectiveness. DESIGN SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: In this  retrospective cohort study, we used Columbia University Medical Center data linked  to State and City Immunization Registries to assess the weekly effectiveness of mRNA  COVID-19 vaccines. We conducted manual chart review of cases in week one in both  groups along with a set of sensitivity analyses for Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and  Janssen vaccines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used propensity score matching with  up to 54,987 covariates and fitted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate  hazard ratios and constructed Kaplan-Meier plots for two main outcomes (COVID-19  infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization). RESULTS: The study included  179,666 patients. We observed increasing effectiveness after the first dose of mRNA  vaccines with week 6 effectiveness approximating 84% (95% CI 72-91%) for COVID-19  infection and 86% (95% CI 69-95) for COVID-19-associated hospitalization. When  analyzing unexpectedly high effectiveness in week one, chart review revealed that  vaccinated patients are less likely to seek care after vaccination and are more  likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 during the encounters for other conditions.  Sensitivity analyses showed potential outcome misclassification for COVID-19  ICD10-CM diagnosis and the influence of excluding patients with prior COVID-19  infection and anchoring in the unexposed group. Overall vaccine effectiveness  analysis in fully vaccinated patients matched the results of the randomized trials.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Observational data can be used to ascertain vaccine  effectiveness if potential biases are accounted for. The data need to be scrutinized  to ensure that compared groups exhibit similar health seeking behavior and are  equally likely to be captured in the data. Given the difference in temporal trends  of vaccine exposure and baseline characteristics, indirect comparison of vaccines  may produce biased results. KEY POINTS: Question: When accounted for all potential  biases, what is the weekly effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines?Findings: In this  cohort study we replicated the results of randomized clinical trials, discovered  plausible increase in effectiveness after week one following the first dose of mRNA  COVID-19 vaccines and found differences in temporal trends of vaccine exposure and  baseline characteristics in vaccinated groups.Meaning: Observational data can be  used to reliably estimate vaccine effectiveness if the biases are accounted for.

In patients with DNA  mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic  colorectal cancer, their efficacy has been demonstrated in recently published  phase-II trials. However, an indirect comparison of effectiveness between  pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and nivolumab+ipilimumab is not yet available. After a  standard literature search, we analyzed four overall survival (OS) curves from three  phase-II trials. Individual patient data were reconstructed from each curve using a  specific web-based technique (Shiny method). Indirect statistical comparisons were  made based on hazard ratio (HR) and restricted mean survival time (RMST).  Nivolumab+ipilumumab had a better HR compared with pembrolizumab (0.65, 95%  confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 1.002, p=0.051); the difference being close to  statistical significance. In the analysis based on RMST, the combination of  nivolumab+ipilimumab showed a significantly longer OS than pembrolizumab  (improvement in RMST, 1.08 mos; 95%CI, 0.11 to 2.06; p=0.029).

Our results favoring the combination of nivolumab+ipilimumab in metastatic  colorectal cancer must be viewed with caution owing to the indirect nature of our  statistical comparisons.

Ravulizumab was engineered from  eculizumab to have an increased half-life allowing for reduced dosing frequency  (8-weekly vs. 2-weekly). To account for differences in respective clinical trials, a  validated balancing technique was used to enable an indirect comparison of  ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment efficacy in aHUS. Patient-level data from four  eculizumab clinical trials were available for pooling and comparison with data from  two ravulizumab trials. In the primary analysis, adult native kidney data were  compared. Propensity scores were calculated from baseline characteristics (dialysis  status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, platelet count, serum lactate  dehydrogenase). Stabilized inverse probability weighting was used to balance groups.  Changes in outcomes from baseline to 26 weeks were compared between treatment  groups. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of  findings. Overall, 85 patients (46 ravulizumab, 39 eculizumab) were included in the  primary analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics were well balanced after  weighting at baseline. At 26 weeks, clinical outcomes (including renal function,  hematological markers, and dialysis prevalence), and fatigue and quality of life  measures were improved with eculizumab and ravulizumab treatment. No differences  between treatment groups reached statistical significance, although confidence  intervals were wide. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis results were consistent with  those of the primary analysis. Using appropriate methodology for indirect comparison  of studies, no differences in outcomes were seen between ravulizumab and eculizumab,  although, owing to small sample sizes, confidence intervals were wide. .",NA,"Tomazos, Ioannis Hatswell, Anthony J Cataland, Spero Chen, Peter Freemantle, Nick Lommele, Åsa Deighton, Kevin Knowles, Emma Sheerin, Neil S Rondeau, Eric",Tomazos I Hatswell AJ Cataland S Chen P Freemantle N Lommele Å Deighton K Knowles E Sheerin NS Rondeau E,NA,NA,eng,NA,Journal Article,20211221,Germany,Clin Nephrol,Clinical nephrology,0364441,IM,NA,NA,2021/12/22 06:00,2021/12/22 06:00,2021/12/21 08:41,2021/12/21 00:00 [accepted] 2021/12/21 08:41 [entrez] 2021/12/22 06:00 [pubmed] 2021/12/22 06:00 [medline],189027 [pii] 10.5414/CN110516 [doi],aheadofprint,Clin Nephrol. 2021 Dec 21. doi: 10.5414/CN110516.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conducted an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of  their effects on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight in patients with type  2 diabetes (T2D). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multilevel network meta-regression (MLNMR)  was conducted, based on a connected evidence network of published results from the  AWARD-11 trial and individual patient data (IPD) from the SUSTAIN FORTE and SUSTAIN  7 trials. RESULTS: Semaglutide 2.0 mg significantly reduced HbA1c versus dulaglutide  3.0 mg and 4.5 mg, with estimated treatment differences (ETD) of -0.44%-points (95%  credible interval [CrI]: -0.68, -0.19) and -0.28%-points (95% CrI: -0.52, -0.03),  respectively. Semaglutide 2.0 mg also significantly reduced body weight versus  dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg with ETDs of -3.29 kg (95% CrI: -4.62, -1.96) and  -2.57 kg (95% CrI: -3.90, -1.24), respectively. Odds of achieving HbA1c <7.0% were  significantly greater for semaglutide 2.0 versus dulaglutide 3.0 mg (odds ratio  [OR]: 2.23 [95% CrI: 1.15, 3.90]), while this did not reach significance for  semaglutide 2.0 mg versus dulaglutide 4.5 mg (OR: 1.58 [95% CrI: 0.82, 2.78]).  Sensitivity analyses supported the main analysis findings. CONCLUSIONS: This ITC  demonstrated significantly greater reductions from baseline in HbA1c and body weight  with semaglutide 2.0 mg vs dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  three-state partitioned survival model was developed to perform a cost-utility  analysis of [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE versus standard of care (high dose Octreotide  LAR), everolimus and sunitinib. Effectiveness data for SoC, everolimus and sunitinib  were obtained from published Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Given a lack of  head-to-head effectiveness data, matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) were  performed to population-adjust [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE survival data based on  prognostic factors and derive estimates of relative effectiveness. Health state  utilities were estimated from real-world evidence. Drug acquisition costs were taken  from nationally published sources (BNF, NICE), and administration costs were based  on treatment protocols in [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE studies, combined with nationally  published unit costs (PSSRU, DoH reference costs). Incidence of adverse events were  estimated using published sources. A discount rate of 3.5% was applied to both  utilities and costs, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were  performed. Costs were included from an NHS perspective and presented in 2017/18 GBP  (and PPP Euros for base case). RESULTS: In GI-NETs, the incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE compared to SoC and  everolimus was £26,528 (€27,672) and £24,145 (€25,186) per QALY, respectively. In  P-NETs, the ICER of [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE compared to SoC was £22,146 (€23,101) or  £28,038 (€29,251) dependent on matched population, and £21,827 (€22,766) and £15,768  (€16,445) compared to everolimus and sunitinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: At a  willingness to pay threshold of £30,000, [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE is likely to be a  cost-effective treatment option for GI-NET and P-NET patients versus relevant  treatment comparators (NHS perspective).",© 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"Glover, Matthew Caplin, Martyn Leeuwenkamp, Oscar R Longworth, Louise",Glover M Caplin M Leeuwenkamp OR Longworth L,NA,"PHMR Health Economics, Pricing and Reimbursement, London, UK.

The objective of the current  analysis was to compare the efficacy of crisaborole 2% relative to pimecrolimus 1%,  tacrolimus 0.03% and tacrolimus 0.1% in patients aged ≥ 2 years with  mild-to-moderate AD by comparing improvement in Investigator's Static Global  Assessment scores ( (ISGA scores of 0/1 indicating ""clear or almost clear""). ISGA  was selected as the primary efficacy outcome given the US Food and Drug  Administration's recommendations on the use of ISGA for assessment of global  severity in AD and to align with efficacy measurements in the crisaborole  registration trials. Safety endpoints could not be analyzed due to differences in  outcome definitions across studies. METHODS: Efficacy of crisaborole was evaluated  using individual patient data (IPD) from two pivotal phase III randomized controlled  trials (RCTs), and efficacy of comparators was evaluated using published RCTs  included in a previous network meta-analysis. Vehicle controls were not comparable  due to differences in ingredients and population imbalance and, therefore, an  unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was used, which reweighted  IPD for crisaborole to estimate absolute response in comparator populations.  RESULTS: The odds of achieving an improvement in ISGA score was higher with  crisaborole 2% versus pimecrolimus 1% (odds ratio [OR] 2.03; 95% confidence interval  [CI] 1.45-2.85; effective sample size =  627, reduced from 1021; p value < 0.001)  and for crisaborole 2% versus tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.09-2.05; effective  sample size = 311, reduced from 1021; p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: The unanchored MAIC  suggests that the odds of achieving an improvement in ISGA score is greater with  crisaborole 2% than with pimecrolimus 1% or tacrolimus 0.03% in patients  aged ≥ 2 years with mild-to-moderate AD. These results are consistent with findings  from the previously published network meta-analysis, which used a different  methodology for performing indirect treatment comparisons.",© 2021.

An indirect treatment comparison (network  meta-analysis) was performed to determine if adjunctive cenobamate increases the  odds ratio (OR) for ≥50% responder rate or for withdrawals due to treatment-emergent  adverse events (TEAEs) leading to ASM discontinuation versus adjunctive therapy with  other ASMs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (maintenance phase ≥ 12 weeks)  assessing adjunctive ASMs in adults with uncontrolled focal seizures. Cenobamate was  compared to a group of seven other ASMs, and to subgroups of branded (brivaracetam,  eslicarbazepine acetate, lacosamide, and perampanel) and older (lamotrigine,  levetiracetam, and topiramate) ASMs at FDA-recommended daily maintenance doses  (FDA-RDMD), at all doses, and at maximum and minimum daily doses. Statistical  significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were eligible for  analysis. The placebo-adjusted ≥ 50% responder rate for FDA-RDMD of cenobamate was  superior (OR 4.200; 95% CI 2.279, 7.742) to FDA-RDMD of all seven assessed (OR 2.202  95% CI 1.915, 2.532; p = 0.044) and branded ASMs (OR 2.148; 95% CI 1.849, 2.494;  p = 0.037). There was no significant difference for ≥50% responder rate between  FDA-RDMD of cenobamate and FDA-RDMD of older ASMs (OR 2.617; 95% CI 1.767, 3.878;  p = 0.202). No significant differences were identified for ≥50% responder rate when  comparing all doses and maximum/minimum doses of cenobamate to all seven, branded,  and older ASMs. Cenobamate demonstrated comparable TEAE withdrawal rates to all  seven ASMs, branded ASMs, and older ASMs across each of the four dose ranges (all  p > 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Patients receiving FDA-RDMD of cenobamate were more likely  to have ≥50% seizure reduction compared with FDA-RDMD of the seven assessed ASMs and  branded ASMs, without an increase in treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs.",Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

In the proposed framework, patients with cancer receive at least two lines  of therapy (LOTs) followed by palliative care throughout their lifetime. Patients  cycle through progression-free and progressive disease health states in each LOT  before death. Under this framework, four broad aspects of modeling effectiveness of  treatment sequences need exploration. First, disease progression, treatment  discontinuation, and the relationship between the two events should be considered.  Second, the effectiveness of each LOT depends on its placement in a treatment  sequence as the effectiveness of later LOTs may be influenced by the earlier LOTs.  Third, the treatment-free interval (TFI; time between discontinuation of earlier LOT  and initiation of later LOT) may impact a therapy's effectiveness. Fourth, in the  absence of head-to-head trials directly comparing LOTs, indirect treatment  comparison (ITC) of outcomes for a specific LOT or even for the entire treatment  sequence is important to consider. A search of decision models that estimated  effectiveness of at least two lines of oncology therapy was conducted in PubMed  (N = 20) and technology appraisals by the National Institute for Health and Care  Excellence (N = 26) to assess four methodological aspects related to the model  framework: (1) selection of outcomes for effectiveness in a treatment sequence, (2)  approaches to adjust the efficacy of a treatment in consideration of its place in  the sequence, (3) approaches to address TFIs between LOTs, and (4) incorporation of  ITCs to estimate comparators' effectiveness in the absence of direct head-to-head  evidence. Most models defined health states based on disease progression on  different LOTs while estimating treatment duration outside of the main model  framework (30/46) and used data from multiple data sources in different LOTs to  model efficacy of a treatment sequence (41/46). No models adjusted efficacy for the  characteristics of patients who switched from an earlier LOT to a later LOT or  adjusted for the impact of prior therapies, and just six models considered TFIs.  While 11 models applied ITC results to estimate efficacy in comparator treatment  sequences, the majority limited the ITC to one LOT in the sequence. Thus, there is  substantial room to improve the estimation of effectiveness for treatment sequences  using existing data when comparing effectiveness of alternative treatment sequences.","© 2021.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative efficacy of cilta-cel vs  physician's choice of treatment, as no head-to-head trials have been conducted.  METHODS: An external control arm for CARTITUDE-1 was created from patients in the  long-term follow-up for three clinical trials of daratumumab (POLLUX, CASTOR, and  EQUULEUS) who satisfied the eligibility criteria of CARTITUDE-1. These patients  received physician's choice of treatment following the discontinuation of study  drugs. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to align the external  control and CARTITUDE-1 populations on important baseline characteristics. Overall  response rate, complete response or better rate, progression-free survival, time to  next treatment, and overall survival were assessed. Several sensitivity analyses  were conducted. RESULTS: After propensity score weighting, baseline characteristics  were comparable between cohorts. Patients showed improved results with cilta-cel vs  physician's choice of treatment: overall response rate (relative risk: 2.95 [95%  confidence interval (CI) 2.27, 3.84; p < 0.0001]), complete response or better  (relative risk: 111.70 [95% CI 29.08, 429.06; p < 0.0001]), progression-free  survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.24 [95% CI 0.15, 0.37; p < 0.0001]), time to next  treatment (HR: 0.14 [95% CI 0.09, 0.22; p < 0.0001]), and overall survival (HR: 0.21  [95% CI 0.13, 0.35; p < 0.0001]). Results were consistent across all sensitivity  analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Cilta-cel showed superior efficacy compared with physician's  choice of treatment, making it a promising new treatment option for patients with  triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.",© 2021.

In the absence of head-to-head studies, the present study  sought to indirectly compare the efficacy and tolerability between these two  treatments. METHODS: This anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) used  patient-level data from the phase 3, randomized, controlled SPARTAN study  (apalutamide + ADT), weighted to match aggregate published data from the ARAMIS  study (darolutamide + ADT) for clinically relevant baseline measures. Hazard ratios  (HR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI) were estimated for efficacy endpoints:  metastasis-free survival (MFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression,  progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Odds ratios were  estimated for tolerability outcomes: adverse events and serious adverse events.  RESULTS: Before weighting, baseline characteristics from SPARTAN versus ARAMIS were  different for median PSA (7.8 vs. 9.2 ng/mL), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  performance status of 1 (23% vs. 31%), use of bone-targeted agents (10% vs. 4%),  median time from initial diagnosis (94.9 vs. 85.4 months), and proportion of  patients from North America (35% vs. 12%) and Europe (50% vs. 64%). After matching  (n = 455), our analysis demonstrated that apalutamide + ADT had a Bayesian  probability of being more effective than darolutamide + ADT for MFS [98.3%; HR 0.70  (95% CrI 0.51, 0.98)], PSA progression [~ 100%; HR 0.46 (95% CrI 0.33, 0.64)], and  PFS [93.2%; HR 0.79 (95% CrI 0.59, 1.08)]. Results for OS and tolerability were  similar between apalutamide + ADT and darolutamide + ADT. CONCLUSION: This anchored  MAIC analysis of pivotal phase 3 studies in patients with nmCRPC suggests that  apalutamide + ADT is more effective than darolutamide + ADT for MFS,  progression-free survival (PFS), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression,  with a similar OS benefit and tolerability profile.

In the  absence of a direct head-to-head comparison, the relative efficacy of brodalumab and  guselkumab in non-responders to ustekinumab were compared using a matching-adjusted  indirect comparison (MAIC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient data for  brodalumab (n = 121) were pooled from the AMAGINE-2 and -3 trials and adjusted using  a propensity score reweighting method, so that baseline and week 16 characteristics  matched the aggregate published data of patients with an inadequate response to  ustekinumab who switched to guselkumab (n = 135) in the NAVIGATE trial. RESULTS:  After inadequate response to ustekinumab, brodalumab resulted in significantly  higher psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 90 rates versus guselkumab at  post-treatment switch week 12 (62.7% vs 48.1%, relative difference 14.6% [95%  confidence interval [CI] 5.3-23.9], p = 0.002 [number needed to treat [NNT] = 6.8])  and week 36 (63.7% vs 51.1%; relative difference 12.6% [95% CI 4.1-21.0]; p = 0.004  [NNT = 7.9]) and PASI 100 rate at week 36 (40.3% vs 20.0%; relative difference 20.3%  [95% CI 11.8-28.7]; p < 0.001 [NNT = 4.9]). CONCLUSION: In this MAIC, brodalumab was  associated with greater improvements than guselkumab in inadequate responders to  ustekinumab.

METHODS: A cost-consequence analysis of the cost and  clinical response of two treatment strategies was conducted over a 2-year time  horizon. A hypothetical cohort of 10 patients with PsA initiated treatment with  secukinumab 150mg (cohort A) or adalimumab 40mg (cohort B), respectively. Patients  achieving clinical response (ACR20/50/70) at week 24 continued the initial  treatment, while patients with inadequate response switched to secukinumab 300mg.  Pharmacological costs were calculated based on SmPC (notified ex-factory price). The  lowest cost of adalimumab biosimilar was considered. Data on clinical response were  extracted from the two matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) published  comparing secukinumab vs adalimumab. Results were expressed as the cost difference  between the two cohorts (€, 2019) and were calculated for each clinical response  criteria (ACR20/50/70) and for each MAIC. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact  of potential discounts on the cost of adalimumab while maintaining the cost of  secukinumab unchanged. RESULTS: Depending on the MAIC used, the cost of initiating  biologic treatment for PsA with secukinumab 150mg was 18-33% lower than the one  estimated for adalimumab 40mg, for ACR20, 18-28% for ACR50, and 16-23% for ACR70  response rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that it would be necessary a discount of  40-60%, 40-65% and 50-75% over the adalimumab cost to compensate for the differences  in efficacy observed for ACR20/50/70, respectively, depending on the MAIC used.  CONCLUSION: In patients with PsA, secukinumab could be considered a more efficient  first-line biologic treatment compared to adalimumab, from the SNHS perspective.","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier España, S.L.U. and Sociedad Española de Reumatología y  Colegio Mexicano de Reumatología.

PATIENTS  AND METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies on the  efficacy of BAY-94-9027 and N8-GP for prophylaxis in patients with HA aged ≥12 years  without a history of inhibitors. Eight studies met systematic literature review  inclusion criteria, but only data from PROTECT VIII on BAY 94-9027 and PATHFINDER 2  on N8-GP could be used for an indirect comparison. Matching-adjusted indirect  comparison (MAIC) and simulated treatment comparison were performed. RESULTS: No  significant differences (unadjusted and adjusted) were observed in the mean  annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for any bleed and proportion of patients with zero  bleeds when comparing BAY 94-9027 to N8-GP. The adjusted treatment difference  [incidence rate ratio (IRR)] in terms of ABR was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.85-1.44). The odds  ratio (OR) of any bleed, measuring the relative effect of BAY 94-9027 versus N8-GP  on the proportion of patients with zero bleeds, was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.60-1.77). FVIII  consumption was significantly lower in BAY 94-9027 [mean adjusted  difference=-1292.57 IU/kg/year (95% CI, ‒2152.44 to ‒432.70)]; a 26.7% reduction in  consumption of BAY-94-9027. The results of the sensitivity analyses were similar to  the main analysis for mean ABRs, percentages of patients with zero bleeds, and  significant reduction in rFVIII consumption. For patients on BAY 94-9027  every-5-days and every-7-days, no differences versus every-4-days N8-GP were  observed for the mean ABR for any bleed [IRR=0.90 (95% CI, 0.68‒1.20)] and  proportion of patients with zero bleeds [OR=1.06 (95% CI, 0.56‒2.02)]. CONCLUSION:  BAY 94-9027 prophylaxis demonstrated 26.7% lower annual consumption when compared to  N8-GP with similar efficacy in terms of ABR and percentage of patients with zero  bleeds.",© 2021 Vashi et al.,"Vashi, Parth Batt, Katharine Klamroth, Robert Mancuso, Maria Elisa Majewska, Renata Tiede, Andreas Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni",Vashi P Batt K Klamroth R Mancuso ME Majewska R Tiede A Mantovani LG,ORCID: 0000-0003-4194-8183 ORCID: 0000-0002-3376-7908 ORCID: 0000-0002-3600-8536,"US Data Generation and Observational Studies, Bayer Corporation, Whippany, NJ, USA.

However,  not all CDK4/6i trials have reported significant overall survival (OS) benefit, and  there have been no head-to-head trials. Two trials have reported OS outcomes in  first-line patients: MONALEESA-3 reported significant OS benefit with first- or  second-line ribociclib plus fulvestrant (RIB+FUL) versus placebo plus fulvestrant  (PBO+FUL), while PALOMA-1 reported no significant OS benefit for palbociclib plus  letrozole (PAL+LET) versus LET in first-line postmenopausal patients.  Matched-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) are an established method for  comparing efficacy of treatments from different trials. We used an MAIC to compare  first-line patients from MONALEESA-3 and PALOMA-1. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An  unanchored MAIC of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in first-line patients  with HR+/HER2- ABC treated with RIB+FUL versus PAL+LET was conducted using  individual patient data from MONALEESA-3 and aggregated data from PALOMA-1. To match  patients in PALOMA-1, patients in MONALEESA-3 were limited to those with no prior  endocrine therapy for ABC and no (neo) adjuvant LET ≤12 months before enrollment.  PFS and OS were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox regression. RESULTS:  A total of 329 and 178 patients from RIB+FUL and PBO+FUL arms, respectively, of  MONALEESA-3 were matched to 84 and 81 patients from PAL+LET and LET arms of  PALOMA-1. After weighting, OS was significantly longer for RIB+FUL versus PAL+LET  (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32-0.77; p = 0.0020). PFS favored RIB+FUL versus  PAL+LET, although the difference was not statistically significant (HR, 0.77; 95%  CI, 0.54-1.10; p = 0.1553). CONCLUSION: Using MAIC to adjust for trial differences,  OS comparisons favored RIB+FUL over PAL+LET as first-line treatment in  postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2- ABC. These exploratory results suggest a  significant increase in OS benefit with RIB treatment compared with PAL.",© 2021 Fasching et al.,"Fasching, Peter A Delea, Thomas E Lu, Yen-Shen De Boer, Richard Hurvitz, Sara A Moynahan, Aaron Chandiwana, David Lanoue, Brad Hu, Huilin Thuerigen, Astrid O'Shaughnessy, Joyce",Fasching PA Delea TE Lu YS De Boer R Hurvitz SA Moynahan A Chandiwana D Lanoue B Hu H Thuerigen A O'Shaughnessy J,NA,"University Hospital Erlangen, Comprehensive Cancer Center Erlangen-EMN, Department  of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg,  Erlangen, Germany.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An Advisory Committee, composed of 15  experts and a multidisciplinary group of 31 additional experts, was appointed,  together forming a Delphi panel of 46 experts. Based on a systematic bibliographic  review and the analysis of the care course of the patient with HF, an initial  battery of key factors for the development of HF care models was identified by the  Advisory Committee. This proposal was adjusted and prioritized by the Delphi panel  applying Delphi Rand/UCLA methodology. RESULTS: After two Delphi rounds, 75 key  factors grouped into 7 challenges were defined. In the first of the challenges,  related to the development of HF management models, 16 key factors were identified,  7 of which were valued as high priority and related to the establishment of common  objectives, resources for the continuity of care and improving the measurement of  health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The definition of management elements at the macro  level was considered a priority to advance in the development of optimal models of  assistance to HF.","Copyright © 2021 FECA.

A  network meta-analysis.,10.1177/17562872211053189 [doi] 17562872211053189,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, new therapeutic combinations based on immunotherapy  provided significant benefits as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced  renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). OBJECTIVE: This work aims to address the lack of  head-to-head comparisons and the uncertainty of the benefit from immunotherapy-based  combinations in all the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC)  subgroups. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A systematic review and a network  meta-analysis were performed. Overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT)  population was the primary endpoint. OS according to IMDC subgroups (favorable,  intermediate, poor), PD-L1 expression, and grade ⩾3 adverse events (AEs) were  secondary endpoints. A SUCRA analysis was performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Six  randomized phase III trials with 5121 patients were included. There was a high  likelihood (82%) that nivolumab-cabozantinib was the preferred treatment in OS. The  benefit of ICI-based combinations over sunitinib was unclear in the favorable-risk  subgroup. Nivolumab-ipilimumab had the best risk/benefit ratio among all the  ICI-based combinations. The limitations were the lack of individual patient data;  the heterogeneity of patients' characteristics, trial designs, and follow-up times;  and a limited number of studies for indirect comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: A customized  approach for the first-line treatment of patients with mRCC should consider the  risk/benefit profile of each treatment option, especially considering the likeliness  of long-term survival finally reached in this setting.","© The Author(s), 2021.","Cattrini, Carlo Messina, Carlo Airoldi, Chiara Buti, Sebastiano Roviello, Giandomenico Mennitto, Alessia Caffo, Orazio Gennari, Alessandra Bersanelli, Melissa",Cattrini C Messina C Airoldi C Buti S Roviello G Mennitto A Caffo O Gennari A Bersanelli M,ORCID: 0000-0003-4785-9480 ORCID: 0000-0002-6527-6281,"Division of Oncology, University Hospital 'Maggiore della Carità', Novara, Italy.

However, a comparative cost-effectiveness  analysis between these FRCs from a UK Health Service perspective has not been  conducted. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes Model was used to estimate lifetime  costs and outcomes in patients with T2DM receiving iGlarLixi (based on the LixiLan-G  trial) versus iDegLira (based on relative treatment effects from an indirect  treatment comparison using data from DUAL III). Utilities, medical costs, and costs  of diabetes-related complications were derived from literature. Model outputs  included costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental  cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated with a local willingness-to-pay threshold  of £20,000 per QALY. Extensive scenario, one-way sensitivity, and probabilistic  sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model.  RESULTS: iGlarLixi was less costly (iGlarLixi, £30,011; iDegLira, £40,742), owing to  lower acquisition costs, and similar in terms of QALYs gained (iGlarLixi, 8.437;  iDegLira, 8.422). Extensive scenario and sensitivity analyses supported the base  case findings. CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control  despite GLP-1 RAs, use of iGlarLixi was associated with substantial cost savings and  comparable utility outcomes. iGlarLixi can be considered as cost-effective versus  iDegLira from the UK Health Service perspective.",© 2021.

METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes  Model was used to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes for a cohort of patients with  type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from the UK healthcare perspective. Initial clinical  data for iGlarLixi were based on the randomized, controlled LixiLan-L trial and the  relative treatment effects for comparators were based on an indirect treatment  comparison using data from the AWARD-9 (iGlar plus Dula), LIRA ADD2 BASAL (BI plus  Lira), and DUAL V (iDegLira) trials. Costs were derived from publicly available  sources. Lifetime costs (in British Pound Sterling [£]) and quality-adjusted  life-years (QALYs) were predicted; net monetary benefit (NMB) for iGlarLixi versus  comparators was derived using a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000. Extensive  scenario and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Estimated costs were  lowest with iGlarLixi (£31,295) compared with iGlar plus Dula (£38,790), iDegLira  (£40,179), and BI plus Lira (£42,467). Total QALYs gained were identical with  iGlarLixi and iDegLira (8.438), and comparable with iGlar plus Dula (8.439) and BI  plus Lira (8.466). NMB for iGlarLixi was positive versus all comparators (£10,603.86  vs. BI plus Lira; £7,466.24 vs. iGlar plus Dula; £8.874.11 vs. iDegLira).

We present  methodologies to indirectly compare immune responses to V114 versus PCV20. RESEARCH  DESIGN AND METHODS: Indirect treatment comparison and matching-adjusted indirect  comparison (MAIC) were performed to estimate opsonophagocytic activity (OPA)  geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios of V114/PCV20 at 30 days post-vaccination with  PCV13 as common comparator for 13 serotypes (STs) shared with a 13-valent PCV  (PCV13) among pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults aged ≥60 years. Data from three V114  studies were pooled (V114, N = 2,196; PCV13, N = 843). In the MAIC analysis, data  were reweighted, matching participant age and sex in NCT03760146 (PCV20, N = 1,507;  PCV13, N = 1,490). RESULTS: The lower bound of V114/PCV20 OPA GMT ratio for all  PCV13 STs is greater than the prespecified  0.5 non-inferiority margin and those for  five PCV13 STs (3, 6A, 6B, 18C, and 23F) are greater than the prespecified 1.2  superiority margin. V114 was associated with 77% greater OPA GMT for ST3 versus  PCV20.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University  Medical Centre, was commissioned to act as the independent evidence review group  (ERG). This paper summarises the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's  critical review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS,  highlights the key methodological considerations and describes the development of  the NICE guidance by the Appraisal Committee. Based on a systematic literature  review, one randomised controlled trial, MAVORIC, was identified showing favourable  results in patients with MF and SS. However, MAVORIC compared mogamulizumab to  vorinostat, which is not standard care in the NHS, and there is uncertainty due to  the study design, specifically crossover of patients. Based on a ""naïve comparison  of results from the vorinostat arm of the MAVORIC study and the physician's choice  arm (methotrexate or bexarotene i.e. United Kingdom [UK] standard treatments) of the  ALCANZA study as well as comparison to Phase II bexarotene data"", the company  considered vorinostat to be ""a reasonable proxy for current standard of care in the  NHS"". The ERG considered, based on the limited data available, that the  comparability of vorinostat (MAVORIC) and physician's choice (ALCANZA) could not be  established. In response to the Appraisal Consultation Document, the company  provided an unanchored matched adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of mogamulizumab  with UK standard care by analysing Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. However,  given the high risk of bias of an unanchored MAIC, these results needed to be  regarded with a considerable degree of caution. The economic analysis suffered from  uncertainty because there was no trial evidence on the comparator in the England and  Wales National Health Service (NHS), and it was unclear to what extent the trial  (MAVORIC) comparator (vorinostat) was comparable to standard care, referred to as  established clinical management (ECM) in the NHS. The evidence for overall survival  had not reached maturity and was confounded by treatment switching, for which  different crossover adjustment methods produced large variations in life years.  Caregiver utilities were applied in the analysis, but there was a lack of guidance  on their application and whether these were indicated in this appraisal. After  consultation, the company updated the economic analysis with the MAIC. Incremental  cost-effectiveness ratios comparing mogamulizumab against ECM were (depending on  whether the HES or MAVORIC comparison were used) £31,030 or £32,634 per  quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained according to the company's base case and  £38,274 or £80,555 per QALY gained according to the ERG's base case. NICE did not  recommend mogamulizumab for treating MF or SS in adults who have had at least one  previous systemic treatment.",© 2021.

In the absence of head-to-head evidence, an indirect  treatment comparison (ITC) of adjuvant nivolumab versus placebo, the proxy for a  watch-and-wait strategy, was conducted in patients with high-risk resected melanoma.  METHODS: An ITC using the Bucher method compared nivolumab with placebo using  intention-to-treat population data from the phase III CheckMate 238 (nivolumab vs  ipilimumab; minimum follow-up, 4 years; NCT02388906) and European Organisation for  Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18071 (ipilimumab vs placebo; minimum  follow-up, ≈4.5 years; NCT00636168) trials. The end-points were recurrence-free  survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS).  To account for cross-trial differences in staging and subsequent therapy, additional  analyses examined patients with stage IIIB/IIIC disease and adjusted post-recurrence  survival in EORTC 18071, respectively. RESULTS: Nivolumab versus placebo was  associated with clinically meaningful improvements in RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53;  95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.68) and OS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.89).  Nivolumab versus placebo was also associated with clinically meaningful improvements  in RFS (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40-0.69), DMFS (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46-0.83) and OS (HR,  0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.97) in patients with stage IIIB/IIIC disease and in OS (HR,  0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.92) in the overall population after adjusting post-recurrence  survival in EORTC 18071. CONCLUSION: This ITC shows that adjuvant nivolumab provides  clinically meaningful improvements in RFS, DMFS and OS versus a watch-and-wait  strategy in high-risk resected melanoma.",Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Based on empirical consensus, current guidance recommends a  ""1-3-6-12 days"" rule to resume OACs after AIS. This study investigated the  suitability of guideline-recommended timing for OAC initiation. METHODS:  Using data  of 12,307 AF patients hospitalized for AIS, for the period 2012 to 2016, in Taiwan's  National Health Insurance Research Database, we constructed a sequence of cohorts of  OAC users and propensity score-matched nonusers, creating one cohort on each day of  OAC initiation for 30 days since admission. Composite outcome included effectiveness  (cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic  attack, systemic embolism, and venous thromboembolism) and safety (intracranial  hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematuria) outcomes. Comparing with  nonusers, we examined the risks in the early OAC use (within 1-3-6-12 days) or  guideline-recommended delayed use. Indirect comparison between the early and delayed  use was conducted using mixed treatment comparison. RESULTS:  Across the AIS  severity, the risks of composite or effectiveness outcome were lower in OAC users  than nonusers, and the risks were similar between the early and delayed use groups.  In patients with severe AIS, early OAC use was associated with an increased risk of  safety outcome, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.67 (confidence interval [CI]:  1·30-2·13) compared with nonusers and a HR of 1.44 (CI: 0·99-2·09) compared with the  delayed use. CONCLUSION:  Our study findings support an early OAC initiation in AF  patients with mild-to-moderate AIS and a routine delayed use of OACs can be  considered in those with severe AIS to avoid a serious bleeding event.","The Author(s).

METHODS: We performed an updated search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and  EMBASE through 23 August 2021 to identify RCTs of adult patients with chronic CAD  and/or PAD that compared combination anticoagulant or P2Y12 inhibitor with low-dose  aspirin to low-dose aspirin alone. Outcomes of interest included major adverse  cardiovascular events (MACEs) including cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial  infarction (MI) and bleeding. When needed, outcomes were pooled using random-effects  models to generate hazard or risk ratios (HRs or RRs) and accompanying 95%  confidence intervals (CIs). Adjusted ITCs using subsequent pooled HRs/RRs were then  performed. RESULTS: Six publications reporting the results of two unique RCTs (one  evaluating clopidogrel + aspirin vs. aspirin alone and the other rivaroxaban 2.5 mg  twice daily + aspirin vs. aspirin alone) were analyzed. The ITC suggested that  rivaroxaban + aspirin was associated with a lower risk of MACEs compared with  clopidogrel + aspirin (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68-0.98). When looking at the  individual components of MACE, rivaroxaban + aspirin was associated with lower risk  of cardiovascular death (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.57-0.98) and stroke (RR = 0.67, 95 CI  = 0.49-0.93) and similar risk of MI (RR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.70-1.23) versus  clopidogrel + aspirin. No evidence of a difference in moderate-to-severe bleeding,  fatal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was seen between the two treatment  strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to clopidogrel + low-dose aspirin, the use of  rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily + low-dose aspirin reduced the risk of MACE, CV death  and stroke including ischemic stroke in patients with or at high risk for chronic  CAD and/or PAD. These benefits of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily + low-dose aspirin  compared to clopidogrel + low-dose aspirin appear to be achieved without  significantly increasing patients' risk of moderate-to-severe bleeding, including  ICH or fatal bleeding.",NA,"Coleman, Craig I Kharat, Akshay A Bookhart, Brahim Baker, William L",Coleman CI Kharat AA Bookhart B Baker WL,ORCID: 0000-0003-4868-7158 ORCID: 0000-0002-1056-9466 ORCID: 0000-0003-2172-0931,"Department of Pharmacy Practice, University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy,  Storrs, Connecticut, USA.

However, their prophylactic effect on PEP in average-risk patients remains  controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the  efficacy and safety of rectal indomethacin and diclofenac in average-risk patients,  and to indirectly compare the prophylactic effect of the two drugs. A comprehensive  search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases was performed to  identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on rectal indomethacin or diclofenac  for prophylaxis against PEP. Fixed- and random-effects models weighted by the  Mantel-Haenszel method were used for direct comparisons. The adjusted indirect  treatment comparison method was used to indirectly compare the efficacy of  indomethacin and diclofenac. A total of 10 RCTs, including 2928 patients, met our  inclusion criteria. No significant publication bias was identified. Pooled estimates  showed that rectal indomethacin and diclofenac were associated with a significant  reduction in the overall risk of PEP compared with control intervention [relative  risk (RR) = 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.83] in average-risk patients.  Subgroup analyses showed that both rectal indomethacin (RR = 0.67; 95% CI:  0.49-0.94) and diclofenac (RR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.23-0.75) were effective in the  prevention of PEP. Indirect comparison showed no significant difference between the  effectiveness of the two drugs in the prevention of PEP (RR = 1.607; 95% CI:  0.824-3.136). The updated meta-analysis suggests that both drugs provide equivalent  protection against PEP in average-risk patients.","© 2021 The Authors.

However, no  trials have compared a PARP inhibitor plus bevacizumab versus a PARP inhibitor, or a  PARP inhibitor versus bevacizumab. We performed an unanchored population-adjusted  indirect treatment comparison to estimate the relative efficacy and safety of  maintenance treatments for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer. METHODS:  Analyses were performed using aggregate data from the PRIMA trial and patient-level  data from a subset of patients from the PAOLA-1 trial that met surgery and staging  eligibility criteria of PRIMA. Propensity weights were used to match baseline  characteristics of the PAOLA-1 subset to those of the PRIMA population. Analysis was  performed in overall (biomarker-unselected) and homologous recombination repair  deficiency (HRD)-positive populations. RESULTS: A total of 595/806 (266/387  HRD-positive) PAOLA-1 patients were included. After matching, the effective sample  size for PAOLA-1 was 532 (242 HRD-positive). Maintenance olaparib plus bevacizumab  reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 43% [hazard ratio (HR) 0.57; 95%  confidence interval (CI): 0.47-0.69] versus niraparib and by 40% (HR 0.60; 95% CI:  0.49-0.74) versus bevacizumab in the biomarker-unselected population and by 43% (HR  0.57; 95% CI: 0.41-0.79) and 60% (HR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.29-0.55), respectively, in the  HRD-positive population. Progression-free survival (PFS) benefits of maintenance  niraparib and bevacizumab arms were comparable in the biomarker-unselected  population (HR 1.07; 95% CI: 0.87-1.32); however, niraparib showed a 30% reduced  risk compared with bevacizumab (HR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51-0.97) in the HRD-positive  population. CONCLUSIONS: In biomarker-unselected and HRD-positive patients,  combination treatment with olaparib plus bevacizumab as maintenance treatment  improves PFS for women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer compared with  either bevacizumab or niraparib alone.

METHODS: An unanchored PA-ITC was performed on  investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) data. Individual patient data  from SOLO1 (olaparib versus placebo) and from BRCA-mutated patients in  PAOLA-1/ENGOT-ov25 (olaparib plus bevacizumab versus placebo plus bevacizumab) were  pooled. Each arm of PAOLA-1 was weighted so that key baseline patient  characteristics were similar to the SOLO1 cohort. Analyses were performed in  patients with complete baseline data. Weighted Cox regression analysis was used to  estimate the comparative efficacy of different maintenance therapy strategies,  supplemented by weighted Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: Data from SOLO1 patients  (olaparib, n = 254; placebo, n = 126) were compared with data from BRCA-mutated  PAOLA-1 patients (olaparib plus bevacizumab, n = 151; placebo plus bevacizumab,  n = 71). Adding bevacizumab to olaparib was associated with a numerical improvement  in PFS compared with olaparib alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71; 95% confidence interval  [CI] 0.45-1.09). Statistically significant improvements in PFS were seen with  olaparib alone versus placebo plus bevacizumab (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.30-0.75), olaparib  plus bevacizumab versus placebo (0.23; 0.14-0.34), and placebo plus bevacizumab  versus placebo (0.65; 0.43-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this hypothesis-generating  PA-ITC analysis support the use of maintenance olaparib alone or with bevacizumab in  patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCAm.",Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Patient-level data from  two pivotal trials, ELIANA (tisagenlecleucel; n = 79) and MT103-205 (blinatumomab; n  = 70), were used in comparisons of CR and OS, controlling for cross-trial difference  in available patient characteristics. Five different adjustment approaches were  implemented: stabilized inverse probability of treatment weight (sIPTW); trimmed  sIPTW; stratification by propensity score quintiles; adjustment for prognostic  factors; and adjustment for both prognostic factors and propensity score.  Comparative analyses indicate that treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated  with a statistically significant higher likelihood of achieving CR and lower hazard  of death than treatment with blinatumomab. The tisagenlecleucel group exhibited a  higher likelihood of CR than the blinatumomab group in every analysis regardless of  adjustment approach (odds ratios: 6.71-9.76). Tisagenlecleucel was also associated  with a lower hazard of death than blinatumomab in every analysis, ranging from 68%  to 74% lower hazard of death than with blinatumomab, determined using multiple  adjustment approaches (hazard ratios: 0.26-0.32). These findings support the growing  body of clinical trials and real-world evidence demonstrating that tisagenlecleucel  is an important treatment option for children and young adults with R/R ALL.","© 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

We conducted this indirect comparison to compare the  efficacy of and safety between these two treatments for providing reference for  decision making. METHODS: Relevant databases were searched for eligible trials. A  well-accepted adjusted indirect treatment comparison (ITC) approach was selected to  pool efficacy results and safety outcomes. Subgroup analyses were stratified  according to PD-L1 expression and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Four eligible  randomized trials (CheckMate9LA, KEYNOTE-021G, KEYNOTE 189, KEYNOTE 407) involving  2017 patients were available to analyze. The ITC results suggested that N-I + chemo  is comparable to Pem + chemo in OS (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82-1.30) and ORR (RR 0.81, 95%  CI 0.62-1.06), but tended to yield inferior PFS (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.59) than did  Pem + chemo. As for safety profiles, N-I + chemo showed no significant difference  relative to Pem + chemo in any grade adverse events: (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.10),  but demonstrated reduced toxicity in chemo-related adverse events, such as anemia  (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81), neutropenia (RR0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.79), and  thrombocytopenia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21-0.69). CONCLUSIONS: N-I + chemo is a  promising treatment option for providing comparable OS related to Pem + chemo.  However, for never smoker female patients, Pem + chemo is preferable to choose for  demonstrating favorable OS benefit than N-I + chemo.","Copyright © 2021 Jiang, Mao, Wang, Jia, Geng, Xu, Jiang, Yang, Jiao and Guo.","Jiang, Panpan Mao, Ziyang Wang, Qinyang Jia, Xiaohui Geng, Luying Xu, Hong Jiang, Lili Yang, Chengcheng Jiao, Min Guo, Hui",Jiang P Mao Z Wang Q Jia X Geng L Xu H Jiang L Yang C Jiao M Guo H,NA,"Department of Medical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong  University, Xi'an, China.

METHODS: At the time of this study,  STORM Part 2, NCT02336815 (selinexor plus low-dose dexamethasone; sel + dex) was  systematically identified as the only feasible comparator to the DREAMM-2 cohort.  Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC) evaluated efficacy and safety of  belamaf (2.5 mg/kg; n = 97) versus sel + dex (80 mg + 20 mg, respectively; n = 123).  Populations were weighted for clinically validated effect modifiers and prognostic  factors. Outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS),  duration of response (DoR), overall response rate (ORR), time to response (TTR), and  safety. The relative efficacy of belamaf versus standard of care (SoC) on OS was  estimated by a Bucher indirect treatment comparison using the MAIC-adjusted hazard  ratios (HR) for OS of belamaf (DREAMM-2) versus sel + dex (STORM Part 2) and a HR  adjusted for refractoriness to carfilzomib and high-risk cytogenetics of sel + dex  (STORM) versus SoC (MAMMOTH). RESULTS: Belamaf demonstrated improved OS (HR 0.53;  95% confidence interval 0.34, 0.83; p = 0.005) and DoR (0.41; 0.21, 0.83; p = 0.013)  versus sel + dex. There were no statistically significant differences in ORR, TTR,  and PFS. Belamaf had a favorable safety profile for most evaluable hematologic  (any-grade, Grade 3-4) and non-hematologic (any-grade) adverse events versus  sel + dex. Significantly improved OS was observed with belamaf versus SoC (0.29;  0.16, 0.54; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Single-agent belamaf represents a new treatment  option for triple-class refractory patients with RRMM.",© 2021.

In contrast to pairwise meta-analysis, which allows for the  comparison of one intervention to another based on head-to-head data from randomized  trials, network meta-analysis (NMA) facilitates simultaneous comparison of the  efficacy or safety of multiple interventions that may not have been directly  compared in a randomized trial. NMAs help researchers study important and previously  unanswerable questions, which have contributed to a rapid rise in the number of NMA  publications in the biomedical literature. However, the conduct and interpretation  of NMAs are more complex than pairwise meta-analyses: there are additional NMA model  assumptions (i.e., network connectivity, homogeneity, transitivity, and consistency)  and outputs (e.g., network plots and surface under the cumulative ranking curves  [SUCRAs]). In this chapter, we will: (1) explore similarities and differences  between pairwise and network meta-analysis; (2) explain the differences between  direct, indirect, and mixed treatment comparisons; (3) describe how treatment  effects are derived from NMA models; (4) discuss key criteria predicating completion  of NMA; (5) interpret NMA outputs; (6) discuss areas of ongoing methodological  research in NMA; (7) outline an approach to conducting a systematic review and NMA;  (8) describe common problems that researchers encounter when conducting NMAs and  potential solutions; and (9) outline an approach to critically appraising a  systematic review and NMA.","© 2022.

We assessed the comparative efficacy of  different strategies for difficult biliary cannulation through a network  meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: We  identified 17 randomized controlled trials (2015 patients) that compared the  efficacy of different adjunctive methods for difficult biliary cannulation  (needle-knife techniques, pancreatic guidewire-assisted technique,  pancreatic-assisted technique, and transpancreatic sphincterotomy) either with each  other or with persistence with the standard cannulation techniques. The success rate  of biliary cannulation and the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) were the  outcomes of interest. We performed pairwise and network meta-analysis for all  treatments and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and  Evaluation criteria to appraise quality of evidence. RESULTS: Low-quality evidence  supported the use of transpancreatic sphincterotomy over persistence with standard  cannulation techniques (risk ratio [RR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI],  1.05-1.59) and over any other adjunctive intervention (RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.01-1.44]  vs pancreatic guidewire-assisted technique, RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.01-1.43] vs early  needle-knife techniques, RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.03-2.10] vs pancreatic stent-assisted  technique) for increasing the success rate of biliary cannulation. No other  significant results were observed in any other comparisons. Based on the network  model, transpancreatic sphincterotomy (P-score, .97) followed by early needle-knife  techniques (P-score, .62) were ranked highest in terms of increasing the success  rate of biliary cannulation. Early needle-knife techniques outperformed persistence  with standard cannulation techniques in terms of decreasing PEP rate (RR, .61; 95%  CI, .37-1.00), whereas both early needle-knife techniques and transpancreatic  sphincterotomy led to lower PEP rates as compared with pancreatic guidewire-assisted  technique (RR, .49 [95% CI, .23-.99] and .53 [95% CI, .30-.92], respectively).  CONCLUSIONS: Transpancreatic sphincterotomy increases the success rate of biliary  cannulation as compared with persistence with the standard cannulation techniques.  Early needle-knife techniques and transpancreatic sphincterotomy are superior to  other interventions in decreasing PEP rates and should be considered in patients  with difficult cannulation.",Copyright © 2022 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library  were searched for articles related to phase 3, double-blind, controlled trials of  vibegron 75 mg and mirabegron 25/50 mg in patients with OAB. Efficacy outcomes  included change from baseline at weeks 4, 12, and 52 in mean daily number of total  urinary incontinence episodes and micturitions and mean volume voided/micturition.  Effect size was computed as placebo-subtracted change from baseline (weeks 4, 12) or  active control (tolterodine)-subtracted change from baseline (week 52) for each  treatment group. Adverse events (AEs) are presented descriptively. RESULTS: After  removal of duplicates, 49 records were identified, and after screening 9 met  inclusion criteria for analysis. Vibegron showed significantly greater reduction in  mean daily number of total incontinence episodes than mirabegron 25 mg at week 4,  mirabegron 50 mg (weeks 4, 52), and tolterodine (weeks 4, 12) (P < 0.05, each) and  significantly greater improvement in volume voided versus mirabegron 25 mg  (week 12), mirabegron 50 mg (weeks 12, 52), and tolterodine (week 4) (P < 0.05,  each). Confidence intervals of point estimates overlapped zero for all other  comparisons of vibegron and mirabegron (25 or 50 mg) or tolterodine, indicating no  significant differences between treatments for these time/endpoints. Urinary tract  infection, hypertension, and dry mouth were the most commonly occurring AEs for  vibegron, mirabegron, and tolterodine, respectively, in the short-term trials;  hypertension was the most commonly occurring AE with all three treatments in the  long-term trials. CONCLUSIONS: Vibegron was associated with significant improvement  in total incontinence episodes versus mirabegron at 4 and 52 weeks and volume voided  at 12 and 52 weeks. Improvement in micturitions was similar between vibegron and  mirabegron or tolterodine. Incidence of AEs was generally comparable between  vibegron and mirabegron.",© 2021.

METHODS: Primary data sources included  individual patient data from the TRANSCEND NHL 001 study (TRANSCEND [NCT02631044];  N = 256 for efficacy set, N = 269 for safety set) for liso-cel and summary-level  data from the ZUMA-1 study (NCT02348216; N = 101 for efficacy set, N = 108 for  safety set) for axi-cel. Inter-study differences in design, eligibility criteria,  baseline characteristics, and outcomes were assessed and aligned to the extent  feasible. Clinically relevant prognostic factors were adjusted in a stepwise fashion  by ranked order. Since bridging therapy was allowed in TRANSCEND but not ZUMA-1, the  initial efficacy and safety analyses included bridging therapy use as a matching  factor (TRANSCEND patients who received bridging therapy were removed). Subsequent  sensitivity analyses excluded this matching factor. RESULTS: The initial analysis  showed similar MAIC-weighted efficacy outcomes between TRANSCEND and ZUMA-1 for  overall and complete response rates (odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.40  [0.56-3.49] and 1.21 [0.56-2.64], respectively) and for overall survival and  progression-free survival (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.81 [0.44-1.49] and 0.95  [0.58-1.57], respectively). MAIC-weighted safety outcomes favored liso-cel, with  significantly lower odds of all-grade and grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome (odds  ratio [95% CI], 0.03 [0.01-0.07] and 0.08 [0.01-0.67], respectively) and  study-specific neurological events (0.16 [0.08-0.33] and 0.05 [0.02-0.15],  respectively). Efficacy and safety outcomes remained similar in sensitivity  analyses, which did not include use of bridging therapy as a matching factor.  CONCLUSIONS: After matching and adjusting for clinically relevant prognostic  factors, liso-cel demonstrated comparable efficacy and a more favorable safety  profile compared with axi-cel in patients with third- or later-line relapsed or  refractory LBCL.

The treatment  outcomes of comparing different MAbs in combination with the above-mentioned agents  remained unclear. We performed the meta-analysis to indirectly compare the effect  and safety of MAbs targeting CD38, SLAMF7, and PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with  bortezomib/immunomodulators plus dexamethasone/prednisone for patients with MM.  METHODS: We searched thoroughly in the databases for randomised controlled trials  (RCTs) in which at least one of the three MAbs were included. We included eleven  eligible RCTs with 5367 patients in the meta-analysis. Statistical analysis was  carried out using StataMP14 and Indirect Treatment Comparisons software. RESULTS: We  calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free  survival (PFS) and relative risk (RR) for overall response rate, complete response  (CR) or better, very good partial response (VGPR) or better, VGPR, partial response,  stable disease, and grade 3 or higher adverse events among the three groups. The HRs  for PFS of the CD38 group vs SLAMF7 group, CD38 group vs PD-1/PD-L1 group, and  SLAMF7 group vs PD-1/PD-L1 group were 0.662 (95%CI 0.543-0.806), 0.317 (95%CI  0.221-0.454), and 0.479 (95%CI 0.328-0.699), respectively. The HR for OS of the CD38  group vs SLAMF7 group was 0.812 (95%CI 0.584-1.127). The RR for CR or better in the  CD38 group vs SLAMF7 group was 2.253 (95%CI 1.284-3.955). The RR for neutropenia of  the CD38 group vs SLAMF7 group was 1.818 (95%CI 1.41-2.344). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment  with the CD38 group had longer PFS and better treatment response than that with the  SLAMF7 or PD-1/PD-L1 group. In addition, the SLAMF7 group prolonged PFS compared  with the PD-1/PD-L1 group and was associated with a lower incidence of grade 3 or  higher neutropenia than the CD38 and PD-1/PD-L1 group. In conclusion, MAbs targeting  CD38 are the best, followed by those targeting SLAMF7; MAbs targeting PD-1/PD-L1 are  the worst when in combination with bortezomib/immunomodulators plus  dexamethasone/prednisone for the treatment of MM.",© 2021.

Transurethral resection of  bladder tumour (TURBT) is the standard treatment for people with NMIBC, but the high  rate of cancer recurrence after first TURBT is a challenge that physicians and  patients face. Tumours seen during follow-up may have been missed or incompletely  resected during first TURBT. TURBT is conventionally performed using white light to  see the tumours. However, small papillary or flat tumours may be missed with the use  of white light alone. With the emergence of new technologies to improve  visualization during TURBT, better diagnostic and patient outcomes may be expected.  We conducted a health technology assessment of two enhanced visualization methods,  both as an adjunct to white light to guide first TURBT for people with suspected  NMIBC-hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL), a solution that is instilled into the  bladder to make tumours fluoresce under blue-violet light, and narrow band imaging  (NBI), a technology that filters light into wavelengths that can be absorbed by  hemoglobin in the tumours, making them appear darker. Our assessment included an  evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, and the budget impact of  publicly funding these new technologies to improve patient outcomes following first  TURBT. The use of NBI in diagnostic cystoscopy was out of scope for this health  technology assessment. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the  clinical evidence from inception to April 15, 2020. We searched for randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the outcomes of first TURBT with the use of  HAL or NBI, both as an adjunct to white light, with the outcomes of first TURBT  using white light alone, or studies that made such comparison between HAL and NBI.  We conducted pairwise meta-analyses using a fixed effects model where head-to-head  comparisons were available. In the absence of any published RCT for comparison  between HAL and NBI, we indirectly compared the two technologies through indirect  treatment comparison (ITC) analysis. We assessed the risk of bias of each included  study using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We assessed the quality of the body of  evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and  Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic  literature search and conducted a cost-utility analysis with a 15-year time horizon  from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly  funding HAL and NBI as an adjunct to white light in people undergoing their first  TURBT for suspected non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in Ontario. RESULTS: In the  clinical evidence review, we identified 8 RCTs that used HAL or NBI as an adjunct to  white light during first TURBT. Pairwise meta-analysis of HAL studies showed that  HAL-guided TURBT as an adjunct to white light significantly reduces recurrence rate  at 12 months compared with TURBT using white light alone (risk ratio 0.70, 95%  confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.95) (GRADE: Moderate). Five-year recurrence-free  survival was significantly higher when HAL was used as an adjunct to white light  than when white light was used alone (GRADE: Moderate). There was little to no  difference in the tumour progression rate (GRADE: Moderate).Meta-analysis of NBI  studies did not show a significant difference between NBI-guided TURBT as an adjunct  to white light and TURBT using white light alone in reducing the rate of recurrence  at 12 months (risk ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.75-1.19) (GRADE: Moderate). No evidence on  the effect on recurrence-free survival or tumour progression rate was identified for  NBI-guided TURBT. The indirect estimate from the network analysis showed a trend  toward a lower rate of recurrence after HAL-guided TURBT than after NBI-guided TURBT  but the difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI  0.51-1.11) (GRADE: Low). Studies showed that use of HAL or NBI during TURBT was  generally safe.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of HAL-guided TURBT compared  with NBI-guided TURBT, both as an adjunct to white light, is $12,618 per  quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared with TURBT using white light  alone and using adjunct NBI, the probability of HAL-guided TURBT being  cost-effective is 69.1% at a willingness-to-pay value of $50,000 per QALY gained and  74.6% at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY gained. The annual budget impact  of publicly funding HAL-guided TURBT in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from an  additional $0.6 million in year 1 to $2.5 million in year 5. CONCLUSIONS: First  TURBT guided by HAL as an adjunct to white light likely reduces the rate of  recurrence at 12 months and increases 5-year recurrence-free survival when compared  with first TURBT using white light alone. There is likely little to no difference in  the tumour progression rate. First TURBT guided by NBI as an adjunct to white light  likely results in little to no difference in the rate of recurrence at 12 months  when compared with first TURBT using white light alone. Based on an indirect  comparison, there may be little to no difference in cancer recurrence rate between  HAL-guided and NBI-guided first TURBT. Use of HAL or NBI during first TURBT is  generally safe. For people undergoing their first TURBT for suspected  non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, using HAL as an adjunct to white light is likely  to be cost-effective compared with using white light alone or with using NBI as an  adjunct to white light. We estimate that publicly funding HAL as an adjunct to white  light to guide first TURBT for people in Ontario with suspected NMIBC would result  in additional costs of between $0.6 million and $2.5 million per year over the next  5 years.","Copyright © Queen's Printer for Ontario, 2021.",NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,Journal Article Meta-Analysis Systematic Review,20210812,NA,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,Ontario health technology assessment series,101521610,IM,NA,NA,2021/09/07 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,2021/09/06 05:59,2021/09/06 05:59 [entrez] 2021/09/07 06:00 [pubmed] 2021/10/29 06:00 [medline],NA,epublish,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser. 2021 Aug 12;21(12):1-123. eCollection 2021.,21,12,1-123,NA,PMC8382283,NA,NA,NA,NA,20211028,NA,"Cost-Benefit Analysis Humans Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Quality-Adjusted Life Years Technology Assessment, Biomedical *Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery",NA,Ontario Health (Quality),NA,"Sehatzadeh, Shayan Higgins, Caroline Tiggelaar, Sean Xie, Xuanqian Wells, David",Sehatzadeh S Higgins C Tiggelaar S Xie X Wells D,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of belantamab  mafodotin (belamaf; DREAMM-2; NCT03525678) was compared with selinexor plus  dexamethasone (SEL+DEX; STORM Part 2; NCT02336815) among patients with RRMM who have  received at least four prior therapies. The base case used a US commercial payer's  perspective over a 10-year time horizon. Efficacy data were based on parametric  survival analysis of DREAMM-2 and matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison  between DREAMM-2 and STORM Part 2, which assessed relative treatment effects between  belamaf and SEL+DEX. Cost inputs included drug treatment, concomitant medications,  adverse event management, subsequent treatments, and disease management. RESULTS:  Belamaf decreased total treatment costs per patient by $14,267 and increased patient  life years by 0.74 and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.49 versus SEL+DEX.  Patients receiving belamaf accrued 0.12 fewer progression-free life years versus  patients on SEL+DEX. CONCLUSIONS: From a US commercial payer's perspective, belamaf  had lower costs, and increased QALYs and life-year gain, compared with SEL+DEX.  Belamaf is therefore likely to be a cost-effective treatment option for patients  with RRMM who have received four or more prior lines of therapy.",NA,"Nikolaou, Andreas Ambavane, Apoorva Shah, Anshul Ma, Wenkang Tosh, Jon Kapetanakis, Venediktos Willson, Jenny Wang, Feng Hogea, Cosmina Gorsh, Boris Gutierrez, Ben Sapra, Sandhya Suvannasankha, Attaya Samyshkin, Yevgeniy",Nikolaou A Ambavane A Shah A Ma W Tosh J Kapetanakis V Willson J Wang F Hogea C Gorsh B Gutierrez B Sapra S Suvannasankha A Samyshkin Y,ORCID: 0000-0002-0686-2395 ORCID: 0000-0003-3561-5585,"Modelling and Simulation, Evidera, London, UK.

METHODS: Individual patient data from the PEGASUS study (NCT03500549)  comparing pegcetacoplan and eculizumab enabled adjustment for baseline differences  compared with published results from the ALXN1210-PNH-302 study (NCT03056040),  comparing ravulizumab and eculizumab. Adjusted differences and 95% confidence  intervals (CIs) were computed via weighted Wald tests for comparisons of  pegcetacoplan vs. ravulizumab, anchored to the common comparator eculizumab.  RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients from PEGASUS (36 pegcetacoplan; 32 eculizumab) and 195  from ALXN1210-PNH-302 (97 ravulizumab; 98 eculizumab) were included. Compared with  ravulizumab, treatment with pegcetacoplan was associated with more transfusion  avoidance (adjusted difference [95% CI] = +71.4% [53.5%, 89.3%]), hemoglobin level  stabilization (+75.5% [56.4%, 94.6%]), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level  normalization (+64.0% [41.8%, 86.1%]), and fewer blood transfusions (-5.7 units  [-7.2, -4.2]). Additionally, patients who received pegcetacoplan experienced  clinically meaningful improvements in fatigue (+8.2 points [3.8, 12.6]), global  health status (+9.6 points [0.1, 19.0]), physical functioning (+11.5 points [3.6,  19.5]), and fatigue symptoms (-13.3 points [-23.7, -3.0]), compared with  ravulizumab. Mean change from baseline in LDH level was not significantly different  for pegcetacoplan vs. ravulizumab.

An  indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis was performed to compare efficacy and  safety of medications (solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil) approved to treat  excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea. METHODS:  Efficacy and safety measures assessed in this indirect treatment comparison included  Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), 20-minute Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT20),  Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), Functional Outcomes of Sleep  Questionnaire (FOSQ), and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (any,  serious, or leading to discontinuation). RESULTS: A systematic literature review  identified 6 parallel-arm, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials that  randomized 1,714 total participants to placebo, solriamfetol, modafinil, or  armodafinil. In this indirect treatment comparison, all comparators were associated  with greater improvements than placebo on the ESS, MWT20, and CGI-C after 4, 8, and  12 weeks of treatment. Relative to comparators and placebo at 12 weeks, solriamfetol  at 150 mg or 300 mg had the highest probabilities of improvement in the ESS, MWT20,  and CGI-C. Modafinil (200 or 400 mg) and solriamfetol (150 or 300 mg) were  associated with greater improvement on the FOSQ than placebo at 12 weeks. Less than  2% of patients using placebo or comparators experienced serious or  discontinuation-related treatment-emergent adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The results  of this indirect treatment comparison show 12 weeks of treatment with solriamfetol,  modafinil, and armodafinil resulted in varying levels of improvement on the ESS,  MWT20, and CGI-C and similar safety risks in participants with excessive daytime  sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search  of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. Outcomes from eligible RCTs  were compared by an indirect treatment comparison using a Bayesian framework.  Subanalyses of Japanese and international trials were performed. RESULTS: Eight RCTs  (duration 26-30 weeks) were included. Mean difference in HbA1c change with iGlarLixi  exceeded that for IDegAsp: -0.64 (95% credible interval -1.01, -0.28) %-units (-7.0  [-11.0, -3.1] mmol/mol) for all trials, -0.39 (-0.55, -0.23) %-units (-4.3 [-6.0,  -2.5] mmol/mol) for international, and -0.88 (-1.11, -0.64) %-units (-9.6 [-12.1,  -7.0] mmol/mol) for Japanese trials. HbA1c target achievement (<7.0%-units  [<53 mmol/mol]) was greater for iGlarLixi in all trials (odds ratio 2.50 [1.06,  5.56]) and Japanese trials (2.17 [1.27, 3.70]), but not in international trials  (2.17 [0.42, 11.11]). Analyses suggesting differences in mean postmeal self-measured  plasma glucose were significantly lower by 1.0-2.0 mmol/L (18-36 mg/dL) with  iGlarLixi in all analyses. Bodyweight change was more favourable (1-2 kg) for  iGlarLixi versus IDegAsp for all analyses (P < 0.05). Comparisons of hypoglycaemia  were inconclusive owing to differences in definitions between studies. Adverse  events were more frequent with iGlarLixi because of gastrointestinal intolerance.  CONCLUSIONS: iGlarLixi appears to offer clinical benefit in glucose control and  bodyweight change in people needing both basal and meal-time intervention.","© 2021 The Authors.

Instead, the comparative efficacy  of siponimod can be derived from indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs). We assessed  the suitability of ITCs leveraging individual patient data from relevant phase III  trials across different MS phenotypes. METHODS: One siponimod trial in patients with  secondary progressive MS (SPMS), four fingolimod trials (three in  relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS], and one in primary progressive MS [PPMS]), and two  ofatumumab trials in relapsing MS (RMS) were considered. The suitability of ITCs was  evaluated based on trial design, patient eligibility criteria, baseline patient  characteristics, placebo response, and outcome definitions for each trial. Analyses  deemed feasible were conducted using one-to-one propensity score matching (PSM).  RESULTS: An ITC between siponimod in SPMS and either fingolimod in RRMS or  ofatumumab in RMS was not feasible because of insufficient overlap in key patient  characteristics (e.g. disability level and relapse history) and differences in  placebo response. However, a comparison between siponimod in SPMS and fingolimod in  PPMS was feasible because of sufficient overlap in eligibility criteria and baseline  characteristics. One-to-one PSM demonstrated siponimod was favored relative to  fingolimod for time to 6- and 3-month confirmed disability progression though not  significantly different (hazard ratio 0.76 [95% confidence interval 0.48-1.20;  p-value = .240] and hazard ratio 0.80 [95% confidence interval 0.52-1.22;  p-value = .300], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: For trials in MS, clinical phenotype is  an important determinant of ITC feasibility. An ITC between siponimod in SPMS and  either fingolimod in RRMS or ofatumumab in RMS was not feasible. The only feasible  comparison was between siponimod in SPMS and fingolimod in PPMS.",NA,"Samjoo, Imtiaz A Worthington, Evelyn Haltner, Anja Spin, Paul Drudge, Christopher Cameron, Chris Brennan, Róisín Dahlke, Frank Adlard, Nicholas",Samjoo IA Worthington E Haltner A Spin P Drudge C Cameron C Brennan R Dahlke F Adlard N,ORCID: 0000-0003-1415-8055 ORCID: 0000-0003-1659-2082 ORCID: 0000-0002-9829-7791 ORCID: 0000-0002-4622-3547 ORCID: 0000-0001-9721-3069 ORCID: 0000-0003-3613-760X ORCID: 0000-0003-3333-6291 ORCID: 0000-0001-6912-1685,"EVERSANA, Burlington, Canada.

It can considerably impair  health-related quality of life (HRQoL) beyond the impairments due to other psoriasis  symptoms, for example, because patients feel ashamed of visible nail defects or  because of the functional impairment in manual activities and walking. In clinical  trials on nail psoriasis, it is therefore crucial to assess whether the treatment  reduces HRQoL impairments that are specific to nail psoriasis. For this purpose, two  validated patient questionnaires are available, the Nail Psoriasis Quality of Life  Scale (NPQ10) and the Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis-Quality  of Life (NAPPA-QOL). The ten-item NPQ10 has the advantage of being short and thus  quick to administer. The 20-item NAPPA-QOL, in contrast, assesses the different  dimensions of HRQoL which is considered a multi-dimensional construct. Yet most  randomized controlled trials on nail psoriasis do not evaluate HRQoL improvement. If  they do, a number of different instruments are used, most of which are not nail  specific. This makes comparison of trial outcomes difficult. Harmonizing the  measurement of HRQoL in future clinical trials on nail psoriasis would improve  comparability across studies and would also enhance the reliability of  meta-analyses.",© 2021.

This study aims  to assess the effects of assessment-schedule matching (ASM) on the relative  effectiveness on the PFS of avelumab versus approved comparator immunotherapies or  chemotherapy after population matching in the second-line (2L) setting for  metastatic urothelial carcinoma. METHODS: The MAIC used patient-level data for  avelumab from the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial (NCT01772004). PFS was compared with  published curves for other treatments to obtain population-adjusted hazard ratios  (HRs). The MAIC was repeated after conducting ASM for differences in tumor  assessment scheduled first at 6 weeks for avelumab and durvalumab and at 8 or 9  weeks for other treatments. RESULTS: MAIC adjustment alone altered the HR estimates  up to 23%, whereas MAIC plus ASM resulted in up to 32.7% reductions from naive  comparisons. Even in cases in which MAIC had little effect, ASM brought an  additional change of 11.1% to 15.4%. Overall, the HR range of avelumab versus other  treatments changed from 0.83 to 1.25 for naive comparisons to 0.76 to 0.99 after ASM  plus MAIC, numerically favoring avelumab. CONCLUSIONS: Small variations in  assessment schedules can introduce bias in unanchored indirect treatment comparisons  of interval-censored time-to-event outcomes. In this study, adjusted PFS was  comparable across second-line urothelial carcinoma treatment options, numerically  favoring avelumab versus immunotherapies and chemotherapy agents. Correcting this  bias is especially important when HRs are applied in cost-effectiveness models to  transition patients between states.",Copyright © 2021 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes  Research.

Supplementary data in  the form of external comparators (ECs) can be used to provide clinical context to  support these drug evaluations. In this study we characterized HTAs for SAT-based  submissions, the use of supplementary EC data and outcomes from HTA review. METHODS:  HTA Accelerator database was used to describe SAT-based HTA submissions with  decisions (2011-2019). RESULTS: A total of 433 SAT-based HTA submissions were  identified between 2011 and 2019 with a 13-fold increase during this period. Around  65%(283/433) were in oncology or hem-oncology. Around 52%(226/433) of submissions  contained some type of EC data, including prior clinical trials (24%, 104) and  real-world data (RWD) (20%, 87), but 40%(175) contained no EC data. The overall  acceptance rate for SAT-based submissions was 48% and with RWD EC data acceptance  was 59%. In the latest 5-year period (2015-2019), use of RWD ECs increased 22% as a  proportion of submissions per year, whereas, prior trial ECs decreased (-14%) and  use of no EC remained stable (-2%). Between 2015 to 2017 and 2018 to 2019,  acceptance rate for RWD ECs increased by 20% (41% in 2015-2017 to 61% in 2018-2019)  whereas prior trial EC use decreased by 10% and no EC submissions decreased 16%. Of  226 submissions using ECs, only 29%(66) used an adjusted indirect treatment  comparison method. CONCLUSIONS: SAT-based submissions to HTA bodies are rapidly  evolving in terms of composition and acceptance. Types of EC and methodological  approach used are important determinants of positive outcomes.",Copyright © 2021 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes  Research.

METHODS: A total of 20 New Zealand  rabbits (half male and half female) were randomly and equally divided into control  and model groups. The chronic gastritis model was established by gavage of 5% sodium  salicylate each day for 5 weeks, while the rabbits of the control group received  gavage of clear water at the same volume. Morphological changes of the tissues of  gastric mucosa, otopoint ""Stomach"" and auricular control point were observed under  light microscope after staining with hematoxylin-eosin (H.E.), and given scores (0-3  points) according to the levels of inflammatory cells. The ultrastructural changes  of the otopoint ""Stomach"" tissue were observed under transmission electronic  microscope (TEM). RESULTS: H.E. staining revealed smoothness of the gastric smooth  muscle with no or a few of inflammatory cells in the control group, and appearance  of gastric mucosal hemorrhage and erosion, slightly disordered epithelial glands and  infiltration of a large number of lymphocytes in the mucosal layer with some  clustered lymphocyte aggregation foci in the model group. The pathological score of  gastric mucous in the model group was significantly higher than that in the control  group (P<0.01). Under light microscope, no obvious changes were observed in the skin  of the otopoint ""Stomach"" of the control group and the control point of the model  group, whereas hyperplasia and abscission in the epidermic cuticle and spinous layer  and basal layer, dermal tissue and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in  the otopoint ""Stomach"" of the model group. Results of TEM observation showed no  significant changes in the ultrastructure of the otopoint ""Stomach"" in the control  group, and swollen and vacuolated epidermal keratinocyte mitochondria, reduced  keratin filament aggregation, widened local cell space, unclear desmosome structure,  activation of the dermal fibroblasts, and an increase of the myelinated nerve  mitochondria in the ""Stomach"" region in the model group.

This study compared the efficacy and consumption of rVIII-SingleChain  (lonoctocog alfa, AFSTYLA(®)) with rAHF-PFM (octocog alfa, Advate(®)) and rFVIIIFc  (efmoroctocog alfa, Elocta(®)), for the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding  episodes in previously treated adolescents/adults with severe haemophilia A, through  a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). METHODS: A systematic literature  review identified published clinical trials for rAHF-PFM and rFVIIIFc. Individual  patient data for rVIII-SingleChain were used to match baseline patient  characteristics to those from published trials, using an approach similar to  propensity score weighting. After matching, annualized bleeding rates (ABR),  percentage of patients with zero bleeds, and rFVIII consumption were compared across  trial populations. RESULTS: Published data were identified from two rAHF-PFM trials  and one rFVIIIFc trial. rVIII-SingleChain had similar ABR (risk ratio [RR]: 0.74  [0.16; 3.48]; RR: 1.18 [0.85; 1.65]) and percentage of patients with zero bleeds  (odds ratio [OR]: 1.34 [0.56; 3.22]; OR: 0.78 [0.47; 1.31]) versus rAHF-PFM and  rFVIIIFc, respectively. Annual rVIII-SingleChain consumption was significantly lower  than rAHF-PFM (mean difference: - 1507.66 IU/kg/year [- 2011.71; - 1003.61]) and  equivalent to rFVIIIFc (RR: 0.96 [0.62; 1.49]). CONCLUSION: Although limited to  published information for comparator trials, these results suggest that with an  annualized rFVIII consumption comparable to rFVIIIFc, but significantly lower than  rAHF-PFM, routine prophylaxis with rVIII-SingleChain is able to maintain a similar  ABR and percentage of patients with zero bleeds, attesting to the long-acting nature  of rVIII-SingleChain.",© 2021.

This study assessed the  cost-effectiveness (CE) of empagliflozin + SoC in comparison to sitagliptin + SoC  and liraglutide + SoC based on the respective CVOT. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes  Model (CDM) was calibrated to reproduce the CVOT outcomes. EMPA-REG OUTCOME baseline  characteristics and CVOT specific treatment effects on risk factors for  cardiovascular disease (HbA1c, BMI, blood pressure, lipids) were applied. Three-year  observed cardiovascular events of empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and  liraglutide + SoC were derived from EMPA-REG OUTCOME and an indirect treatment  comparison. Relative risk adjustments to calibrate the CDM were obtained after a  trial and error process to match as closely the observed and CDM-predicted outcomes.  The drug-specific treatment effects were considered up until HbA1c reached 8.5% and  treatment switch occurred. After this switch, the United Kingdom Prospective  Diabetes Study 82 risk equations predicted events based on co-existing risk factors  and treatment intensification to basal bolus insulin were applied. The analysis was  conducted from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system applying 3%  discounting. The time horizon was lifelong. RESULTS: Empagliflozin + SoC provides  additional Quality Adjusted Life years (QALY + 0.564) for an incremental cost of  42,497RMB (US$6053) compared to sitagliptin + SoC, resulting in an Incremental Cost  Utility Ratio of 75,349RMB (US$10,732), thus below the willingness-to-pay threshold  of 212,676RMB, corresponding to three times the Gross Domestic Product in China  (2019). Compared to liraglutide + SoC, empagliflozin + SoC use leads to 0.211QALY  gained and cost savings of 71,427RMB (US$10,173) and is as such dominant. Scenario  and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results.  CONCLUSION: Results suggest that empagliflozin + SoC is cost-effective compared to  sitagliptin + SoC and liraglutide + SoC at a willingness-to-pay threshold of  212,676RMB ($30,292)/QALY.",© 2021.

METHODS: Systematic literature review and indirect  treatment comparisons were conducted of randomized controlled trials reporting  efficacy and safety outcomes. Efficacy was characterized by Modified Ashworth Scale  (MAS) and Ashworth Scale (AS) up to 16-weeks post-injection. Results were used to  inform a cost-effectiveness model with a 1-year time horizon, linking response rates  with health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes and costs from a UK  perspective. Other data sources included in the cost-effectiveness model were drug  unit costs, health care resource utilization based on UK physician survey, and HRQoL  impacts of adverse events associated with oral anti-spasticity therapies. Results  were characterized as cost per quality-adjusted life year and cost per responder.  RESULTS: Six studies were included in evidence syntheses. There was a trend towards  greater response rate for aboBoNT-A which resulted in improved HRQoL and lower  annual costs compared with onaBoNT-A. Safety outcomes were similar across BoNT-A  therapies. In cost-effectiveness analysis, aboBoNT-A was an economically dominant  therapy with respect to cost per quality-adjusted life year. The cost per responder  at 1 year was estimated to be £39,056 for aboBoNT-A vs. £54,831 for onaBoNT-A.  LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on observed safety and efficacy data, aboBoNT-A  is estimated to result in higher treatment response and consequently increased  quality-of-life and reduced costs, vs. onaBoNT-A in children with upper limb  spasticity. Limitations to the study include study heterogeneity limited details  available for onaBoNT-A studies (e.g. use of physical therapy), and limited  availability of responder data.

Due to  the lack of evidence to directly compare them, we conducted this network  meta-analysis to indirectly compare the effectiveness and toxicity of modified  FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB. METHODS: The eligible retrospective studies on treatments  related to modified FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB up to 4 April 2020 were searched and  assessed. We used the frequentist model to analyze the survival and toxicity data  between different treatments. Pooled analysis for overall survival (OS),  progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and events of  toxicity were analyzed in this study. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were involved in  this network meta-analysis. The comparisons on OS and PFS showed that modified  FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB had similar treatment efficacy (OS: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.78-1.63;  PFS: HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.85-1.67). GEM-NAB was more effective than modified  FOLFIRINOX based on the result of ORR (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.04-1.96). Moreover, our  analysis showed a similar toxicity profile between modified FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB.  CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence showed that modified FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB were  similar in survival and toxicity.

METHODS: A cost-minimization model was built to estimate and  compare treatment, disease management, and adverse event costs based on KEYNOTE-024  and -042, and CheckMate 227 Part 1a trial survival and adverse event data. RESULTS:  1L pembrolizumab generates $54,343, $75,744, and $76,259 per patient cost savings  compared with 1L nivolumab plus ipilimumab for patients with NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS ≥  1% within 1, 2, and 3 years of treatment initiation, respectively. CONCLUSION:  Pembrolizumab is cost saving as 1L treatment for PD-L1-positive metastatic NSCLC in  comparison with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, at least for the short term.",© 2021.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  Bucher indirect comparison was conducted to compare efficacy outcomes of semaglutide  1.0 mg versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg using published results from the SUSTAIN 7  and AWARD-11 trials. Sensitivity analyses using individual patient data from SUSTAIN  7 and aggregate data from AWARD-11 were conducted to explore the impact of  adjustment for cross-trial imbalances in baseline characteristics. RESULTS:  Semaglutide 1.0 mg significantly reduced HbA1c versus dulaglutide 3.0 mg, with an  estimated treatment difference (ETD) of -0.24%-points (95% confidence interval [CI]  -0.43, -0.05), with comparable reductions in HbA1c versus dulaglutide 4.5 mg with an  ETD of -0.07%-points (95% CI -0.26, 0.12). Semaglutide 1.0 mg significantly reduced  body weight versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg with an ETD of -2.65 kg (95% CI -3.57,  -1.73) and -1.95 kg (95% CI -2.87, -1.03), respectively. Sensitivity analyses  supported the primary analysis findings. CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison  showed significantly greater reductions in HbA1c with semaglutide 1.0 mg versus  dulaglutide 3.0 mg and comparable HbA1c reductions versus dulaglutide 4.5 mg.  Semaglutide 1.0 mg significantly reduced body weight versus both dulaglutide 3.0 and  4.5 mg. With several glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists available,  information regarding their comparative efficacy can be valuable to clinicians.","© 2021 The Authors.

This enables  flexible, individualized treatment schedules, which reduce the burden of prophylaxis  and improve patient outcomes. This analysis compared the efficacy of recombinant  factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) and recombinant factor IX albumin fusion  protein (rIX-FP), two EHL therapies approved for prophylaxis and treatment of  bleeding in hemophilia B. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect treatment  comparison (MAIC) was used to adjust the between-treatment differences in baseline  characteristics. Individual patient data for rFIXFc (B-LONG) were matched to  aggregated data for rIX-FP (PROLONG-9FP) followed by statistical comparison for  estimated annualized bleeding rate (ABR) using a Poisson regression model with  adjustment for over dispersion. Data were analyzed according to treatment regimen  prior to study entry: prior prophylaxis (rFIXFc, n=48; rIX-FP, n=40) or prior  episodic treatment (n=43 and n=19, respectively). Relative treatment effects are  presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).  RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline characteristics, estimated ABR observed for  rFIXFc and rIX-FP was not significantly different in patients on prior prophylaxis  (1.87 versus 1.58; IRR 1.18, 95% CI 0.67-2.10) or prior episodic (2.25 versus 2.22;  IRR 1.01 95% CI 0.40-2.57) regimens. CONCLUSION: This MAIC analysis shows that the  estimated ABR for rFIXFc-treated patients from B-LONG was similar to that of  rIX-FP-treated patients from PROLONG-9FP and, therefore, indicates that the two EHL  therapies provide similar efficacy when used as prophylaxis for patients with  hemophilia B. Trough levels differ between the two products (1-3% [targeted] versus  20% [observed], respectively), suggesting that trough level is not a surrogate  indicator when ABR is used as a criterion for clinical efficacy when comparing these  FIX products in hemophilia B.",© 2021 Astermark et al.,"Astermark, Jan Wojciechowski, Piotr Aballéa, Samuel Hakimi, Zalmai Nazir, Jameel Klamroth, Robert",Astermark J Wojciechowski P Aballéa S Hakimi Z Nazir J Klamroth R,ORCID: 0000-0001-8400-1171 ORCID: 0000-0003-4194-8183,"Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, and Department of Hematology,  Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden.

We examined generalizability of HTE detected using  causal forests in two similarly designed randomized trials in type II diabetes  patients. Methods We evaluated published HTE of intensive versus standard glycemic  control on all-cause mortality from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in  Diabetes study (ACCORD) in a second trial, the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial  (VADT). We then applied causal forests to VADT, ACCORD, and pooled data from both  studies and compared variable importance and subgroup effects across samples.  Results HTE in ACCORD did not replicate in similar subgroups in VADT, but variable  importance was correlated between VADT and ACCORD (Kendall's tau-b 0.75). Applying  causal forests to pooled individual-level data yielded seven subgroups with similar  HTE across both studies, ranging from risk difference of all-cause mortality of  -3.9% (95% CI -7.0, -0.8) to 4.7% (95% CI 1.8, 7.5). Conclusions Machine learning  detection of HTE subgroups from randomized trials may not generalize across study  samples even when variable importance is correlated. Pooling individual-level data  may overcome differences in study populations and/or differences in interventions  that limit HTE generalizability.",Copyright © 2021.

OBJECTIVE: To determine which of the 2 therapies would  result in the lowest overall cost from a US health plan perspective, under the  assumption of equivalent clinical efficacy and safety. METHODS: A cost-minimization  model was developed in Microsoft Excel. The model incorporated only costs that  differ between the treatments, including drug acquisition, administration, and  monitoring costs, over a 52-week horizon. Average dosing for EPAG and ROMI was taken  from the long-term EXTEND trial and from a published metaanalysis of 14 clinical  trials, respectively. ROMI is injectable and EPAG is oral, so only ROMI had  administration costs. The model assumed patients used 25 mg EPAG tablets and the 250  μg vial size of ROMI. ROMI wastage was included in drug acquisition costs by  rounding up average dose to the nearest whole vial. Monitoring requirements were  determined from US prescribing information, with platelet monitoring assumed equal,  and hepatic panel testing every 4 weeks for EPAG. The model was adjustable to  commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid plan perspectives, with optional inclusion of  drug wastage, monitoring, or administration costs. RESULTS: The base case used a  commercial plan perspective, with average dosing of 51.5 mg/day for EPAG and 4.20  μg/kg/week for ROMI. The analysis found a cost difference per treated patient of  $64,770 in favor of EPAG on an annual basis. Breakdown by unique costs for EPAG  included drug-acquisition cost of $123,135 and monitoring cost of $705. Breakdown by  unique costs for ROMI included drug-acquisition cost of $183,234, with wastage of  $63,179 and administration cost of $5,377. Based on a hypothetical commercial plan  with 1 million members and an estimated 11 patients with cITP receiving ROMI,  potential annual savings for switching all patients from ROMI to EPAG is $712,473 or  $0.06 per member per month. EPAG remained the less costly option for all plan types  and assumptions. A sensitivity analysis found that the result was most sensitive to  drug pricing and wastage inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Because of lower drug-acquisition  costs (including drug wastage) and administration costs, treatment of cITP with EPAG  is associated with a lower net cost per patient than ROMI.

There is no head-to-head CVOT comparing these treatments and heterogeneity between  their CVOTs renders conventional indirect comparison inappropriate. Therefore, a  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to compare the effects of  s.c. semaglutide and dulaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in  patients with and without established cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS:  Individual patient data from SUSTAIN 6 were matched with aggregate data from REWIND,  using a propensity score method to balance baseline effect-modifying patient  characteristics. Hazard ratios (HRs) for three-point (3P) MACE (CV death, non-fatal  myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke), anchored via placebo, were then indirectly  compared between balanced populations. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test  the robustness of the main analysis. RESULTS: After matching, included effect  modifiers were balanced. In the main analysis, s.c. semaglutide was associated with  a statistically significant 35% reduction in 3P MACE versus placebo (HR, 0.65 [95%  confidence interval [CI]; 0.48, 0.87]) and nonsignificantly greater reduction (26%)  versus dulaglutide (HR, 0.74 [95% CI; 0.54, 1.01]). Results were supported by all  sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a statistically  significant lower risk of 3P MACE for s.c. semaglutide versus placebo, in a  population with lower prevalence of pre-existing CVD than that in the pre-specified  primary analysis in SUSTAIN 6. Reduction in 3P MACE with s.c. semaglutide was  greater than with dulaglutide, although not statistically significant.","© 2021 Novo Nordish A/S.

Platinum-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have  been extensively researched in recent years as promising treatments in the  neoadjuvant setting. However, clinical data is lacking in direct comparisons of  these two treating regimens. METHODS: We conducted an online search on PubMed,  Embase, Cochrane Online Library and key oncological meetings for available  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating ICIs or platinum drugs versus  anthracyclines and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AT-based NACT).  Conventional meta-analyses were conducted separately, and then indirect comparisons  for clinical efficacy and safety profile were performed between ICIs and platinum  drugs using AT-based NACT as a common comparator. RESULTS: Seven random controlled  trials (RCTs) with 1,647 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The indirect  comparison demonstrated that ICIs plus chemotherapy significantly improved  pathological complete response (pCR) rate (p = 0.00445, OR, 1.78; 95%CI, 0.70-4.53),  and decreased the adverse effect (AE) related discontinuance versus platinum-based  chemotherapy (P = 0.00015; OR 0.46; 95%CI, 0.26-0.82). CONCLUSION: ICIs plus  chemotherapy showed increased pCR rate and decreased adverse effects compared with  platinum-based chemotherapy in early TNBC. However, subgroup analysis and survival  data to explore the proper patients for each treatment remains scarce. Therefore,  further studies with powered direct comparisons of these two treating regimens are  required.","Copyright © 2021 He, Peng, Sun and Liu.","He, Qin Peng, Yicheng Sun, Jie Liu, Jianxia",He Q Peng Y Sun J Liu J,NA,"Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,  Suzhou, China.

The current study  aimed to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of add-on anti-seizure  medications in DS. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE database search and a manual search  was done using keywords; ""antiepileptic"", ""Dravet syndrome"" and ""antiseizure"". The  primary efficacy outcome was ≥50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency from  baseline while the safety outcome was treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  Frequentist approach were used for combining direct and indirect evidence and  network plots prepared. The drugs were ranked based on p-scores obtained using the  surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA). Heterogeneity across studies was  calculated by I(2) statistic and Q test. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) with 565 patients with DS (2-20 years) who received placebo or any of the  three active interventions (stiripentol, cannabidiol, and fenfluramine) were  included. Compared with placebo, all the three drugs were associated with a  significant reduction in convulsive seizure frequency from baseline. Stiripentol had  the highest probability ranking for ≥50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency  from baseline [OR: 20.2; 95% CI: 2.1-198.0] and for occurrence of any treatment  emergent adverse events (TEAEs) [OR:53.9; 95% CI: 1.4 to 2079.8] followed by  fenfluramine and cannabidiol. However, for serious TEAEs, the ranking order was  stiripentol followed by cannabidiol and fenfluramine. The trial on stiripentol had  limited sample size explaining the wide confidence intervals for the comparative  outcomes. CONCLUSION: In this indirect comparison, fenfluramine and stiripentol hadd  comparable efficacy but fenfluramine appeareded to be safer in terms of less  frequent serious TEAEs. Cannabidiol had relatively lower efficacy and was associated  with serious TEAEs. A head-to-head trial between stiripentol, cannabidiol and  fenfluramine is the need of the hour.",Copyright © 2021.

METHODS: MAICs were performed with individual patient data for cilta-cel  (CARTITUDE-1; NCT03548207) and published summary-level data for ide-cel (KarMMa;  NCT03361748). Treated patients from CARTITUDE-1 who satisfied the eligibility  criteria for KarMMa were included in the analyses. The MAIC adjusted for unbalanced  baseline covariates of prognostic significance identified in the literature and by  clinical expertise. Comparative efficacy was estimated for overall response rate  (ORR), complete response or better (≥CR) rate, duration of response (DoR),  progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Cilta-cel was  associated with statistically significantly improved ORR (odds ratio [OR]: 94.93  [95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.86, 412.25; p < .0001]; relative risk [RR]: 1.34),  ≥CR rate (OR: 5.49 [95% CI: 2.47, 12.21; p < .0001]; RR: 2.21), DoR (hazard ratio  [HR]: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.29, 0.87; p = .0137]), and PFS (HR: 0.37 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.62;  p = .0002]) when compared with ide-cel. For OS, the results were in favor of  cilta-cel and clinically meaningful but with a CI overlapping one (HR: 0.55 [95% CI:  0.29, 1.05; p = .0702]).

However, the long-term  clinical and economic impact of using bosutinib versus dasatinib and nilotinib has  not been evaluated. The objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of  bosutinib compared with dasatinib and bosutinib compared with nilotinib from a US  payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using partition  survival methods and three health states: progression-free, progression, and death.  Trial data (individual patient-level and aggregate-level data) informed the  progression-free and overall survival estimates. Costs included drugs and medical  resource use. Utility values were obtained from literature. Sensitivity analyses  (SAs) included one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs). RESULTS:  Comparing bosutinib versus dasatinib resulted in a gain of 0.4 discounted life  years, 1.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental costs of $28,459  (values in 2020 US dollars), for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of  $19,811/QALY gained. Comparing bosutinib versus nilotinib resulted in a gain of 0.8  discounted life-years, 1.8 QALYs, and incremental costs of $76,563, for an ICER of  $41,932/QALY gained. Drug costs and extrapolation distribution type were the main  drivers of the model in the one-way SAs. In the PSAs, bosutinib had >90% and >80%  probabilities of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of  $100,000/QALY versus dasatinib and nilotinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results  suggest that compared with dasatinib and nilotinib, bosutinib may represent good  value for money for treating 2L CP-CML patients.",© 2021.

An important recent innovation in  RF ablation is Ablation Index (AI), known also as the VISITAG SURPOINT™ Module, a  composite lesion quality marker whose use has been shown to significantly reduce the  incidence of acute and late pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection and the recurrence of  atrial arrhythmias in PsAF. Due to a lack of direct comparative evidence between the  latest generations of technologies, there is uncertainty regarding the best  treatment option in PsAF. The objective of the present study was to conduct a  matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) using individual  patient-level data (IPD) to assess the comparative effectiveness of the THERMOCOOL  SMARTTOUCH™ Catheter or the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH™ SF Catheter with AI/VISITAG  SURPOINT™ Module (STAI) versus the second-generation CB catheter (Arctic Front  Advance™; herein referred to as CB) with respect to 12-month atrial arrhythmia  recurrence, fluoroscopy time, and procedural efficiency. METHODS: IPD for STAI were  obtained from four investigator-initiated studies and were pooled. Comparable CB  studies identified from a systematic literature review were also pooled. In the  absence of a common treatment arm between STAI and CB studies, an unanchored MAIC  was conducted. The primary analysis compared the pooled STAI IPD to the pooled CB  cohort, with corrections for differences across trials, including eligibility  criteria and patient baseline characteristics. Scenario and sensitivity analyses  were conducted to assess the robustness of the primary analysis. RESULTS: In the  primary analysis, which was adjusted for left atrial diameter (LAD), age, diabetes,  and sex, STAI was associated with a statistically significant 65% relative reduction  in the rate of arrhythmia recurrence compared to CB at 12-month follow-up (HR 0.35;  95% CI 0.23, 0.52). STAI was associated with shorter total fluoroscopy time than CB  but longer procedure time. Results were consistent across scenario and sensitivity  analyses. CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency ablation with AI significantly reduced atrial  arrhythmia recurrence at 12-month follow-up and fluoroscopy time compared to CB,  with longer procedure times.",© 2021.

METHODS: In  the absence of studies for both onasemnogene abeparvovec and nusinersen with a  common comparator, a Bayesian naïve indirect treatment comparison (ITC) and MAIC  between onasemnogene abeparvovec and nusinersen were conducted to compare efficacy  and safety of onasemnogene abeparvovec with nusinersen. Outcomes of interest were  event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and motor milestone achievements  (independent sitting and independent walking). Relative treatment effects were  expressed as relative risk (RR) and risk difference. RESULTS: Pooled and weighted  patient-level data illustrated a favorable effect toward onasemnogene abeparvovec,  suggesting longer EFS for patients compared with nusinersen (HR of onasemnogene  abeparvovec vs. nusinersen: 0.19 [95% CI: 0.07-0.54; 99% CI: 0.05-0.74]). At 24  months of follow-up, patients receiving onasemnogene abeparvovec were statistically  significantly more likely to achieve the motor milestone of sitting independently  compared with patients treated with nusinersen. Although statistically significant  differences were not observed at 6 to 18 months between treatment options, the  likelihood of sitting independently at 12 and 18 months numerically favored  onasemnogene abeparvovec. A numerically greater likelihood of walking by 18 and 24  months was also observed for patients treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec compared  with nusinersen. Onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy was also associated with a  favorable (but statistically nonsignificant) outcome for OS and may be associated  with prolonged survival compared with nusinersen (HR of onasemnogene abeparvovec vs.  nusinersen: 0.35 [95% CI: 0.09-1.32; 99% CI: 0.06-2.01]). Bayesian naïve ITC results  were similar to the MAIC analysis for EFS, OS, and motor milestone achievements.  Small sample size limited covariate matching to baseline CHOP INTEND and nutritional  support requirement, leading to wider CIs and statistically inconclusive outcomes  for some of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations of the current MAIC  analysis (mainly a small sample size for statistical testing, even for the pooled  onasemnogene abeparvovec trials, and potential differences in prognostic and  predictive factors between studies), the relative treatment effects in EFS, OS, and  motor milestone achievement indicate that onasemnogene abeparvovec may offer  continued benefit compared with nusinersen through 24 months of follow-up.",NA,"Bischof, Matthias Lorenzi, Maria Lee, Jennifer Druyts, Eric Balijepalli, Chakrapani Dabbous, Omar",Bischof M Lorenzi M Lee J Druyts E Balijepalli C Dabbous O,NA,"Novartis Gene Therapies, Zürich, Switzerland.

Popular methods include matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) and  simulated treatment comparison (STC). There is limited formal evaluation of these  methods and whether they can be used to accurately compare treatments. Thus, we  undertake a comprehensive simulation study to compare standard unadjusted indirect  comparisons, MAIC and STC across 162 scenarios. This simulation study assumes that  the trials are investigating survival outcomes and measure continuous covariates,  with the log hazard ratio as the measure of effect. MAIC yields unbiased treatment  effect estimates under no failures of assumptions. The typical usage of STC produces  bias because it targets a conditional treatment effect where the target estimand  should be a marginal treatment effect. The incompatibility of estimates in the  indirect comparison leads to bias as the measure of effect is non-collapsible.  Standard indirect comparisons are systematically biased, particularly under stronger  covariate imbalance and interaction effects. Standard errors and coverage rates are  often valid in MAIC but the robust sandwich variance estimator underestimates  variability where effective sample sizes are small. Interval estimates for the  standard indirect comparison are too narrow and STC suffers from bias-induced  undercoverage. MAIC provides the most accurate estimates and, with lower degrees of  covariate overlap, its bias reduction outweighs the loss in precision under no  failures of assumptions. An important future objective is the development of an  alternative formulation to STC that targets a marginal treatment effect.",© 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: A US  hospital-based budget impact model was developed to estimate the impact of ECP in  reducing the surgical complication of anastomotic leak. The incremental acquisition  cost of ECP vs SOC was compared to the net potential savings from reduced  complication costs. The model was based on complication rates from a recently  published matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) that compared clinical and  healthcare utilization outcomes of patients using ECP with those of a propensity  score-matched retrospective SOC control cohort from a real-world clinical practice  population. The model assessed total cost, average length of stay (LOS), proportion  of patients with a non-home discharge, and all-cause readmission. Deterministic  (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to evaluate the  robustness of the model assumptions and inputs. RESULTS: Despite a higher device  cost of $412 for ECP compared with $298 for a manual stapler, annual savings due to  avoided complications with ECP was $53,987 for anastomotic leak, assuming 100  procedures per year with each type of circular stapler. ECP also helped to avoid 27  LOS days, 0.38 readmissions and 0.22 non-home discharges. Sensitivity analyses  around potential drivers of costs established the robustness of economic savings  with the use of ECP - with annual savings being most impacted by the probability of  anastomotic leak complication in the DSA. CONCLUSION: This model demonstrates that  among patients undergoing left-sided colectomy procedures, the incremental cost of  using the ECHELON CIRCULAR™ Powered Stapler instead of a manual circular stapler was  offset by the savings from lowered incidence and cost of management of anastomotic  leaks in the hospital setting.",© 2021 Pollack et al.,"Pollack, Esther Johnston, Stephen Petraiuolo, William J Roy, Sanjoy Galvain, Thibaut",Pollack E Johnston S Petraiuolo WJ Roy S Galvain T,NA,"Franchise Health Economics and Market Access, Ethicon, Blue Ash, OH, USA.

METHODS: A Markov model with a 4-week cycle length was used to compare MEP with BEN  and RES as therapies added to SoC in the management of SEA, in terms of cost per  QALY gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs (€2019) were  obtained from public sources, while utilities and transition probabilities were  retrieved from literature, e.g. network meta-analysis. Continuation criteria for  biological treatment and reduction of oral corticosteroids (OCS) was set at 50%  minimum reduction of exacerbation rate. Adverse events related to chronic OCS use  included diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts, acute myocardial infarct, and peptic  ulcer. The analysis was performed over a 5-year time horizon from the National  Healthcare System (NHCS) perspective, with a yearly discount rate of 3% applied to  both costs and QALYs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and univariate  deterministic sensitivity analysis were performed to address uncertainty around the  cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: On top of SoC, the model indicates that MEP is  dominant (lower cost, higher benefit) compared to BEN and RES: For BEN and RES,  respectively, treatment with MEP had a point estimate of 0.076 and 0.075 additional  QALYs, and savings of €3,173.47 and €7,772.95 per patient. The findings were robust  to variation as estimated using sensitivity analysis.

Its cost-effectiveness (CE)  was previously evaluated based on interim trial analyses (follow-up ∼1 year). The  present analysis describes CE incorporating additional follow-up based on  protocol-specified final trial analyses (1-1.5 years additional follow-up), from a  US healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: A partitioned survival model is used to  compare pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs chemotherapy using data from the KN189  (non-squamous patients) and KN407 (squamous patients) clinical trials. An indirect  treatment comparison vs pembrolizumab monotherapy is made for patient subgroups with  PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and 1-49% based on data from the KN024 and KN042 trials. Efficacy,  treatment utilization, health utility, and safety data are derived from trials and  projected over 20 years. Costs for drugs, non-drug disease management, and adverse  events are also incorporated. RESULTS: Overall, versus chemotherapy alone,  pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is projected to increase life expectancy by 1.12 years  (3.35 vs 2.23) and 0.67 years (3.17 vs 2.50) in non-squamous and squamous patients,  respectively. Resultant ICERs ($158,030/QALY and $178,387/QALY) are below a US  3-times GDP per capita threshold ($195,000/QALY). ICERs vs chemotherapy also  generally fall below the threshold within PD-L1 sub-groups (except in squamous  PD-L1 < 1%, which may have differed due to small sample size) while ICERs vs  pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 ≥ 50% and 1-49% sub-groups generally exceed it  (except in squamous PD-L1 1-49%); largely a result of the higher drug acquisition  cost of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy relative to differences in life expectancy.  CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, with longer-term trial follow-up and in the context of  prior literature, in the US, one of the two options for pembrolizumab use (either  pembrolizumab + chemotherapy or pembrolizumab monotherapy), represents a  cost-effective treatment in virtually all non-squamous and squamous metastatic NSCLC  patient populations and PD-L1 sub-groups evaluated.",NA,"Insinga, Ralph P Feliciano, Josephine L Qiao, Nan Vandormael, Kristel Zhang, Ying",Insinga RP Feliciano JL Qiao N Vandormael K Zhang Y,NA,"Center for Observational and Real-World Evidence, Merck & Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ,  USA.

Comparison between CGRPmAbs and previously approved Botulinum  neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) will inform optimal preventive treatment of chronic migraine,  but head-to-head trials are lacking. We therefore aimed to perform adjusted indirect  comparison between CGRPmAbs and BoNT-A through a meta-analysis. Methods: OVID  MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, clinical  registries, and government websites were searched from inception to September 2019.  Randomized controlled trials comparing CGRPmAbs or BoNT-A with placebo in the  preventive treatment of chronic migraine were included. The primary outcomes were  headache days and migraine days measured at week 12. Data were synthesized by using  a frequentist approach; and the treatments were ranked by P-score. Results: We  included 10 trials (n = 4,678) after screening 1049 candidates. Six trials were with  low risk of bias. Fremanezumab had an effect similar to BoNT-A in the reduction of  headache days at week 12 (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.08, 95%CI -0.55 to -0.7).  Galcanezumab reduced more migraine days than BoNT-A at week 12 (SMD, -0.94, 95%CI  -1.24 to -0.63); fremanezumab showed similar findings (SMD, -0.55, 95%CI -0.85 to  -0.24). Galcanezumab and fremanezumab had better effect in mitigating headache  impact at week 12. CGRPmAbs and BoNT-A had similar adverse event rate. Conclusion:  CGRPmAbs and BoNT-A had similar effect in the preventive treatment of chronic  migraine. BoNT-A might be preferentially selected owing to its cost-effectiveness  profiles. Further studies with direct comparison of the two treatments are  warranted.","Copyright © 2021 Chen, Ye, Tang, She, Chen and Zheng.","Chen, Yao-Yao Ye, Xiao-Qian Tang, Tai-Chun She, Tian-Wei Chen, Min Zheng, Hui",Chen YY Ye XQ Tang TC She TW Chen M Zheng H,NA,"The Third Hospital/Acupuncture and Tuina School, Chengdu University of Traditional  Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.

We examined the cost-effectiveness of second- or third-line+ (2L+ or 3L+) lorlatinib  in Sweden, versus chemotherapy. METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three  health states (progression free, progressed, or death) was used. Lorlatinib relative  efficacy versus chemotherapy was derived using unanchored matching adjusted indirect  treatment comparisons from a phase 2 clinical trial. Utility data were derived from  the same trial and published studies. Costs (year 2019) were obtained from Swedish  national data. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum using a societal  perspective (base case). Model robustness was evaluated with deterministic and  probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For 2L+, the average discounted total  quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain was 1.29 years. Total incremental costs were  Swedish krona (SEK) 731,791, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio  (ICER) of SEK 566,278 per QALY gained. Non-discounted survival gain amounted to  1.94 years. For 3L+, the average discounted total QALY gain was 1.25 years. Total  incremental costs were SEK 754,801, resulting in an ICER of SEK 603,934 per QALY  gained. Non-discounted survival gain was 1.88 years. Sensitivity analyses were  consistent. CONCLUSIONS: ICERs ranged from SEK 421,000 to SEK 384,066 less than the  boundary for a cost-effective treatment for a high-severity disease in Sweden (SEK  988,000), suggesting 2L+ or 3L+ lorlatinib is a cost-effective treatment for  ALK-positive NSCLC versus chemotherapy.",© 2021.

Thus,  comparisons between non-reference treatments rely on indirect evidence, and are  based on the unidentifiable consistency assumption, limiting the reliability of the  results. We suggest a method of performing a sensitivity analysis through data  imputation to assess the robustness of results with an unknown degree of  inconsistency. METHODS: The method involves imputation of data for randomized  controlled trials comparing non-reference treatments, to produce a complete network.  The imputed data simulate a situation that would allow mixed treatment comparison,  with a statistically acceptable extent of inconsistency. By comparing the agreement  between the results obtained from the original star-shaped network meta-analysis and  the results after incorporating the imputed data, the robustness of the results of  the original star-shaped network meta-analysis can be quantified and assessed. To  illustrate this method, we applied it to two real datasets and some simulated  datasets. RESULTS: Applying the method to the star-shaped network formed by  discarding all comparisons between non-reference treatments from a real complete  network, 33% of the results from the analysis incorporating imputed data under  acceptable inconsistency indicated that the treatment ranking would be different  from the ranking obtained from the star-shaped network. Through a simulation study,  we demonstrated the sensitivity of the results after data imputation for a  star-shaped network with different levels of within- and between-study variability.  An extended usability of the method was also demonstrated by another example where  some head-to-head comparisons were incorporated. CONCLUSIONS: Our method will serve  as a practical technique to assess the reliability of results from a star-shaped  network meta-analysis under the unverifiable consistency assumption.",NA,"Yoon, Jeong-Hwa Dias, Sofia Hahn, Seokyung",Yoon JH Dias S Hahn S,ORCID: 0000-0002-4684-4917,"Interdisciplinary Program in Medical Informatics, Seoul National University College  of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.

The aim of  this study was to compare the Padua downstaging protocol to the XXL protocol in  terms of downstaging failure rates and patient outcome. A total of 191 patients  undergoing aggressive surgical downstaging and potentially eligible for LT from 2012  to 2018 at our center were retrospectively selected according to XXL trial criteria.  Unlike the XXL trial, patients with a complete response to downstaging did not  receive any prioritization for LT. Downstaging failure was defined as stable  progressive disease or post-treatment mortality. The statistical method of  ""matching-adjusted indirect comparison"" was used to match the study group to the XXL  population. Downstaging failure rate was considerably lower in the study group than  in the XXL trial (12% vs. 32%, d value = |0.683|). The survival curves of our LT  group (n = 68) overlapped with those of the LT-XXL group (p = 0.846). Survival  curves of non-LT candidates with a sustained complete response (n = 64) were similar  to those of transplanted patients (p = 0.281).

METHODS: Patients in the ECP trial  cohort were propensity score matched to those in the historical cohort through  nearest neighbor matching. Outcomes included 30-day readmission rates; length of  stay (LOS) for the index admission; rates of anastomotic leak, pelvic abscess,  ileus/small bowel obstruction, infection, bleeding, and stoma creation. RESULTS: The  study included 168 patients in the ECP trial cohort and 4544 patients in the  historical cohort; 165 ECP trial patients were matched to 1348 historical cohort  patients. After matching, conversions were more prevalent in the historical cohort  than the ECP trial cohort (4.2% ECP vs. 10.2% historical, p = 0.001). Relative to  the historical cohort, the ECP trial cohort had statistically significant lower  rates of 30-day inpatient readmission (6.1% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.019), anastomotic leak  (1.8% vs. 6.9%, p < 0.001), ileus/small bowel obstruction (4.8% vs. 14.7%,  p < 0.001), infection (1.8% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.001), and bleeding (1.8% vs. 9.2%,  p < 0.001) during the index admission or within 30 days thereafter. No statistically  significant differences in rates of pelvic abscess, stoma creation, or LOS were  found between the two cohorts. Three sensitivity analyses to address the difference  in conversion rates yielded largely consistent results, with loss of statistical  significance for inpatient admission in some cases. This study is limited by its  potential for differences in unmeasurable factors between the ECP trial and  historical cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the ECP trial cohort had lower  incidence proportions of several surgical complications as compared with the  historical cohort. Further controlled prospective clinical studies are needed to  confirm the validity of this finding.",© 2021.

METHODS: Two cost-utility models were constructed for the two licensed indications  using similar methodologies but indication-specific data. Clinical efficacy data  were based on pooled analyses of clinical trials for tisagenlecleucel (pALL: ELIANA,  ENSIGN, B2101J; DLBCL: JULIET, NCT02030834) and published data for comparator  treatments. Treatment effects were compared based on matching-adjusted indirect  comparison (MAIC) analyses. Four clinical lymphoma and leukaemia experts provided  Switzerland-specific input regarding comparators, diagnostic and therapeutic  procedures, clinical evidence and costs, which were used to inform the models. The  base case analysis reflected the perspective of the Swiss mandatory health insurance  system. Deterministic, probabilistic and scenario analyses were carried out to  explore the robustness of results. RESULTS: The base case analysis resulted in  incremental costs of CHF 31,961-CHF 36,419 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)  gained for pALL across the different comparators and CHF 113,179 for DLBCL (1  CHF = 1.09 USD). Incremental costs per life-year gained ranged between CHF  33,906-CHF 97,399 across the two indications. Including productivity gains,  tisagenlecleucel was shown to be dominant (more effective and less costly) over all  the comparators for pALL and to result in incremental costs per life-year gained of  CHF 57,324 for DLBCL. CONCLUSION: Using hypothetical willingness-to-pay thresholds  of CHF 100,000-150,000 per QALY gained, the present analysis has shown  tisagenlecleucel to be a cost-effective treatment option in pALL and DLBCL.",NA,"Moradi-Lakeh, Maziar Yaghoubi, Mohsen Seitz, Patrick Javanbakht, Mehdi Brock, Elisabeth",Moradi-Lakeh M Yaghoubi M Seitz P Javanbakht M Brock E,ORCID: 0000-0002-2733-4946,"Optimax Access LLC, 93 Martinique, Laguna Niguel, CA, 92677, USA.

Recent estimates from a single-arm trial (BHV3000-201)  have also shown evidence of long-term preventive effects in monthly migraine days  (MMDs) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aimed to compare MMDs  and HRQoL data for oral rimegepant to those obtained in placebo-controlled trials  for injectable anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) galcanezumab and erenumab.  METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) were conducted using  rimegepant subject-level data and published aggregate-level results from mAb trials.  Rimegepant baseline characteristics were matched to the pooled subject  characteristics from EVOLVE-I/II (galcanezumab vs. placebo; n = 1773) and STRIVE  (ereumab vs. placebo; n = 955) by reweighting the rimegepant subjects to more  closely match the distributions observed in these trials. To align with inclusion  criteria of the mAb trials, only the subset of rimegepant subjects with a history of  4-14 MMDs were included (n = 257). Weighted mean differences were used to calculate  adjusted change in MMDs, Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS) score, and  Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire version 2 (MSQv2) scores from  baseline to week 12. RESULTS: When matched to the EVOLVE trials, rimegepant was  superior to placebo with a mean difference in MMD change from baseline [95%  confidence interval] of -1.16 [-1.80, -0.52] and was not statistically significantly  different from galcanezumab 0.59 [-0.13, 1.32]. When matched to the STRIVE trial,  rimegepant was superior to placebo -1.59 [-2.15, -1.03] and was not statistically  significantly different from erenumab -0.06 [-0.61, 0.50]. Rimegepant showed  superior MIDAS and MSQv2 results compared with placebo in both EVOLVE trials and in  the STRIVE trial, no statistically significant differences from galcanezumab and  erenumab regarding MIDAS, and favorable results compared with erenumab across all  MSQv2 domains, while being generally similar to galcanezumab across all MSQv2  domains. CONCLUSIONS: When adjustments were made to reflect baseline characteristics  in published literature, supporting data from BHV3000-201 suggest that rimegepant  every other day is an effective therapy in reducing disability and MMDs and  enhancing migraine-specific HRQoL. These data support the preventive benefit  observed in randomized trials of rimegepant and further validate its efficacy for  both acute and preventive treatment of migraine.",© 2021 American Headache Society.,"Popoff, Evan Johnston, Karissa Croop, Robert Thiry, Alexandra Harris, Linda Powell, Lauren Coric, Vladimir L'Italien, Gilbert Moren, James",Popoff E Johnston K Croop R Thiry A Harris L Powell L Coric V L'Italien G Moren J,NA,"Broadstreet Health Economics & Outcomes Research, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

However, there is no direct evidence for their  relative effectiveness and safety. In this study, we conducted an indirect treatment  comparison to compare the efficacy and safety of CGRP monoclonal antibody with  botulinum toxin for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. Methods: Up to  August 31, 2020, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library  Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central). Weighted mean difference (WMD) and  relative risk (RR) were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. Indirect treatment  comparison (ITC) software was used to conduct indirect treatment comparison.  Results: Ten studies were pooled with 6,325 patients in our meta-analysis. Both  botulinum toxin and CGRP monoclonal antibody demonstrated favorable efficacy in the  change of migraine days, headache days, HIT-6 score, and 50% migraine responder rate  compared with placebo. In indirect treatment comparison, CGRP monoclonal antibody  was superior to botulinum toxin in the frequency of acute analgesics intake (WMD =  -1.31, 95% CI: -3.394 to 0.774, p = 0.02113), the rate of treatment-related adverse  events (AEs) (RR = 0.664, 95% CI: 0.469 to 0.939, p = 0.04047), and the rate of  treatment-related serious adverse events (RR = 0.505, 95% CI: 0.005 to 46.98, p <  0.001). Conclusion: For chronic migraine patients, CGRP monoclonal antibody was  slightly better than botulinum toxin in terms of efficacy and safety. In the future,  head-to-head trials would be better to evaluate the efficacy and safety between  different medications in the prevention of chronic migraine.","Copyright © 2021 Lu, Zhang, Guo, Liu, Xu, Hu, Ni, Lu and Zhao.","Lu, Jiajie Zhang, Quanquan Guo, Xiaoning Liu, Wei Xu, Chunyang Hu, Xiaowei Ni, Jianqiang Lu, Haifeng Zhao, Hongru",Lu J Zhang Q Guo X Liu W Xu C Hu X Ni J Lu H Zhao H,NA,"Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,  Suzhou, China.

In the absence of  randomized head-to-head trials, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) can  be used to adjust for cross-trial differences and evaluate the comparative efficacy  and safety of these agents. We used MAIC methodology to indirectly compare key  outcomes with ozanimod (OZM) and teriflunomide (TERI) in the treatment of RMS.  METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify clinical trials  evaluating the efficacy and safety of OZM vs TERI. Given the absence of head-to-head  trials of OZM vs TERI, we used a matching-adjusted indirect comparison to adjust for  potential treatment effect modifiers and prognostic factors while assessing  confirmed disability progression (CDP), relapse, and safety outcomes. Individual  patient data for OZM (SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B trials) and aggregate level data  for TERI (ASCLEPIOS I/II, TOWER, OPTIMUM, and TEMSO trials) were used to evaluate  the following outcomes: annualized relapse rate (ARR), proportion of patients  relapsed, CDP at 3 and 6 months, overall adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs),  and discontinuations due to AEs. RESULTS: After matching, baseline patient  characteristics were balanced between OZM and TERI. Compared with TERI, OZM  demonstrated significant improvements in ARR (rate ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62-0.84),  proportion of patients relapsed (odds ratio [OR]: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.44-0.70), overall  AEs (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.29-0.43), SAEs (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.37-0.77), and  discontinuations due to AEs (OR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.09-0.21). OZM demonstrated  statistically significant improvements in CDP at 3 months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78;  95% CI: 0.66-0.92) but nonsignificant differences at 6 months (HR: 0.78; 95% CI:  0.60-1.01) compared with TERI.

CD19-directed  chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has recently been introduced as a new  option for these patients. Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) is an investigational  CAR T-cell therapy that has shown promising activity in this setting. We used an  unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) methodology to compare  liso-cel, using individual patient-level data from the TRANSCEND NHL 001 (TRANSCEND;  NCT02631044) trial, to salvage chemotherapy, using summary-level data from the  SCHOLAR-1 study, for the treatment of patients with R/R LBCL. Standardized mean  differences were used to evaluate imbalances between the TRANSCEND and SCHOLAR-1  studies. MAIC was conducted to determine the relative efficacy of liso-cel vs.  salvage chemotherapy with regard to overall survival, complete response rate, and  objective response rate. For all efficacy outcomes assessed, comparisons of clinical  factors before MAIC showed that five of seven baseline characteristics were similar  between the TRANSCEND and SCHOLAR-1 studies; however, age and R/R to last therapy  status differed between studies, thus requiring matching and adjusting to ensure the  validity of this analysis. The base case analyses demonstrated a significantly lower  risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4-0.6;  p < 0.001) with significantly higher rates of complete response (odds ratio, 12.9;  95% CI 8.0-20.7) and objective response (odds ratio, 7.0; 95% CI 4.6-10.5) for  patients treated with liso-cel than patients treated with salvage chemotherapy. MAIC  comparisons demonstrated favorable efficacy for liso-cel compared with salvage  chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with R/R LBCL.Trial Registration  ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02631044.",NA,"Salles, Gilles Spin, Paul Liu, Fei Fei Garcia, Jacob Kim, Yeonhee Hasskarl, Jens",Salles G Spin P Liu FF Garcia J Kim Y Hasskarl J,ORCID: 0000-0002-9541-8666,"Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 530 E 74th St, New York,  NY, 10021, USA. sallesg@mskcc.org.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the  comparative benefit, risk, and immunogenicity of different rotavirus vaccines by  synthesizing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies. DATA  SOURCES: Relevant studies published in 4 databases: Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane  Library, and Web of Science were searched until July 1, 2020, using search terms  including ""rotavirus"" and ""vaccin*."" STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials and  cohort and case-control studies involving more than 100 children younger than 5  years that reported the effectiveness, safety, or immunogenicity of rotavirus  vaccines were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A random-effects model was  used to calculate relative risks (RRs), odds ratios (ORs), risk differences, and 95%  CIs. Adjusted indirect treatment comparison was performed to assess the differences  in the protection of Rotarix and RotaTeq. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary  outcomes were RVGE, severe RVGE, and RVGE hospitalization. Safety-associated  outcomes involved serious adverse events, intussusception, and mortality. RESULTS: A  meta-analysis of 20 RCTs and 38 case-control studies revealed that Rotarix (RV1)  significantly reduced RVGE (RR, 0.316 [95% CI, 0.224-0.345]) and RVGE  hospitalization risk (OR, 0.347 [95% CI, 0.279-0.432]) among children fully  vaccinated; RotaTeq (RV5) had similar outcomes (RVGE: RR, 0.350 [95% CI,  0.275-0.445]; RVGE hospitalization risk: OR, 0.272 [95% CI, 0.197-0.376]). Rotavirus  vaccines also demonstrated higher protection against severe RVGE. Additionally, no  significant differences in the protection of RV1 and RV5 against rotavirus disease  were noted in adjusted indirect comparisons. Moderate associations were found  between reduced RVGE risk and Rotavac (RR, 0.664 [95% CI, 0.548-0.804]), Rotasiil  (RR, 0.705 [95% CI, 0.605-0.821]), and Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine (RR, 0.407  [95% CI, 0.332-0.499]). All rotavirus vaccines demonstrated no risk of serious  adverse events. A positive correlation was also found between immunogenicity and  vaccine protection (eg, association of RVGE with RV1: coefficient, -1.599; adjusted  R2, 99.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The high protection and low risk of serious  adverse events for rotavirus vaccines in children who were fully vaccinated  emphasized the importance of worldwide introduction of rotavirus vaccination.  Similar protection provided by Rotarix and RotaTeq relieves the pressure of vaccines  selection for health care authorities.",NA,"Sun, Zi-Wei Fu, Yu Lu, Hai-Ling Yang, Rui-Xia Goyal, Hemant Jiang, Ye Xu, Hua-Guo",Sun ZW Fu Y Lu HL Yang RX Goyal H Jiang Y Xu HG,NA,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing  Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.

Empagliflozin reduced major adverse CV event  (MACE) by 14%, CV death by 38%, and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) by 35%  vs placebo, each on top of standard of care (SoC). SGLT-2 inhibitors canagliflozin  and dapagliflozin have also been compared with placebo, all on top of SoC, in CV  outcome trials. In the CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study)  Program, canagliflozin reduced MACE by 14% and HHF by 33%. Dapagliflozin reduced HHF  by 27% in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial (Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of  Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events). This analysis estimated  the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or SoC,  in US adults with T2DM and established CV disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:  Individual patient-level discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict  time-to-event for CV and renal outcomes, and specific adverse events over patients'  lifetimes. Occurrence of events in EMPA-REG OUTCOME was estimated based on  event-free survival curves with time-dependent covariates. An HR for canagliflozin  or dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on each clinical event was estimated from  published CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58, and EMPA-REG OUTCOME data using indirect  treatment comparison. Public sources provided US costs and utilities. RESULTS: The  model predicted longer survival for empagliflozin versus canagliflozin,  dapagliflozin, and SoC mainly due to direct reduction in CV death. Empagliflozin  dominated canagliflozin, yielding more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; 0.38) at  a lower cost (-US$306). Compared with dapagliflozin and SoC, empagliflozin yielded  0.50 and 0.84 incremental QALYs at US$1517 and US$27 539 incremental costs, yielding  incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$3054/QALY and US$32 848/QALY,  respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin was projected to dominate canagliflozin and  be highly cost-effective compared with dapagliflozin and SoC using US healthcare  costs.",© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

METHODS: Systematic review methodology was based on the Cochrane  Collaboration handbook and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-analyses. Four databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science)  were queried from inception to July 30, 2020. Two independent reviewers screened  potentially relevant studies and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes of interest were  symptom score (SS), medication score (MS), combined symptom medication score (CSMS),  and Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Meta-analyses with an  adjusted indirect comparison were conducted in RevMan 5.4.1. RESULTS: Seven SCIT  versus SLIT randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated no significant  differences for any outcomes, but insufficient data precluded direct meta-analysis.  For the adjusted indirect comparison, 46 RCTs over 39 studies were included for SCIT  versus placebo (n = 13) and SLIT versus placebo (n = 33). Statistically significant  results favoring SCIT were found for SS (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.40;  95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31-0.49), MS (SMD = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.14-0.39), CSMS  (SMD = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.17-0.67), and RQLQ (MD = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.04-0.44).  Statistically significant results favoring SLIT were found for SS (SMD = 0.42; 95%  CI = 0.32-0.53), MS (SMD = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.28-0.53), CSMS (SMD = 0.37; 95%  CI = 0.29-0.45), and RQLQ (MD = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.20-0.43). No significant  differences were found between SCIT and SLIT for SS (SMD = -0.02; 95% CI = -0.15 to  0.11), MS (SMD = -0.14; 95% CI = -0.31 to 0.03), CSMS (SMD = 0.05; 95% CI = -0.21 to  0.31), or RQLQ (MD = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.31 to 0.15). CONCLUSION: SCIT and SLIT are  comparably effective treatments for adults with AR/C. More RCTs analyzing SCIT  versus SLIT are needed to directly compare the two.

BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons represent an  established therapeutic tool for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). A  comparison between PCB and SCB is still lacking. METHODS: We performed an indirect  comparison between two cohorts of patients previously included into two  investigator-driven registries with clinical primary endpoints, 494 treated with the  Elutax SV PCB (AR Baltic, Lithuania) from the DCB RISE registry, and 596 treated  with the Magic Touch SCB (Concept Medical, India) from the EASTBOURNE registry. The  primary endpoint was the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at  12-month clinical follow-up. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, a total of  580 patients were well matched for baseline clinical and procedural characteristics  and were analyzed. At 12 months there was no significant difference between the  matched DCB RISE and EASTBOURNE cohorts in terms of the primary endpoint MACE (10.3%  DCB RISE vs. 10.7% EASTBOURNE, p = 0.892). No significant difference was observed  also regarding the rate of TLR (7.9% DCB RISE vs. 8.3% EASTBOURNE; p = 0.879,  respectively). By multivariate analysis, insulin-dependent diabetes was the only  predictor of MACE.

The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either  the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although  there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow  sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled  trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in  psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains  unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head,  which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the  efficacy and safety of non-biological systemic agents, small molecules, and  biologics for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network  meta-analysis, and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their  efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: For this living systematic review we updated  our searches of the following databases monthly to September 2020: the Cochrane  Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched  two trials registers to the same date. We checked the reference lists of included  studies and relevant systematic reviews for further references to eligible RCTs.  SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic treatments in  adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic  arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed with moderate-to-severe  psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to placebo or another active  agent. The primary outcomes of this review were: the proportion of participants who  achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area and Severity  Index (PASI) 90 at induction phase (from 8 to 24 weeks after the randomisation), and  the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) at induction  phase. We did not evaluate differences in specific adverse events. DATA COLLECTION  AND ANALYSIS: Several groups of two review authors independently undertook study  selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised  the data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments  of interest and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the PASI  90 score) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse events). We assessed the  certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes and all  comparisons, according to CINeMA, as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We  contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. We used the surface under  the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to infer on treatment hierarchy: 0% (treatment  is the worst for effectiveness or safety) to 100% (treatment is the best for  effectiveness or safety). MAIN RESULTS: We included 158 studies (18 new studies for  the update) in our review (57,831 randomised participants, 67.2% men, mainly  recruited from hospitals). The overall average age was 45 years; the overall mean  PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were  placebo-controlled (58%), 30% were head-to-head studies, and 11% were multi-armed  studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. We have assessed a total of 20  treatments. In all, 133 trials were multicentric (two to 231 centres). All but two  of the outcomes included in this review were limited to the induction phase  (assessment from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation). We assessed many studies  (53/158) as being at high risk of bias; 25 were at an unclear risk, and 80 at low  risk. Most studies (123/158) declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 22  studies did not report their source of funding. Network meta-analysis at class level  showed that all of the interventions (non-biological systemic agents, small  molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo  in reaching PASI 90. At class level, in reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments  anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more  effective than the small molecules and the non-biological systemic agents. At drug  level, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, risankizumab and guselkumab  were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than ustekinumab and three  anti-TNF alpha agents: adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept. Ustekinumab and  adalimumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than etanercept;  ustekinumab was more effective than certolizumab, and the clinical effectiveness of  ustekinumab and adalimumab was similar. There was no significant difference between  tofacitinib or apremilast and three non-biological drugs: fumaric acid esters  (FAEs), ciclosporin and methotrexate. Network meta-analysis also showed that  infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab, and  brodalumab outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in reaching PASI 90.  The clinical effectiveness of these drugs was similar, except for ixekizumab which  had a better chance of reaching PASI 90 compared with secukinumab, guselkumab and  brodalumab. The clinical effectiveness of these seven drugs was: infliximab (versus  placebo): risk ratio (RR) 50.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.96 to 120.67,  SUCRA = 93.6; high-certainty evidence; ixekizumab (versus placebo): RR 32.48, 95% CI  27.13 to 38.87; SUCRA = 90.5; high-certainty evidence; risankizumab (versus  placebo): RR 28.76, 95% CI 23.96 to 34.54; SUCRA = 84.6; high-certainty evidence;  bimekizumab (versus placebo): RR 58.64, 95% CI 3.72 to 923.86; SUCRA = 81.4;  high-certainty evidence; secukinumab (versus placebo): RR 25.79, 95% CI 21.61 to  30.78; SUCRA = 76.2; high-certainty evidence; guselkumab (versus placebo): RR 25.52,  95% CI 21.25 to 30.64; SUCRA = 75; high-certainty evidence; and brodalumab (versus  placebo): RR 23.55, 95% CI 19.48 to 28.48; SUCRA = 68.4; moderate-certainty  evidence. Conservative interpretation is warranted for the results for bimekizumab  (as well as mirikizumab, tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, acitretin, ciclosporin,  fumaric acid esters, and methotrexate), as these drugs, in the NMA, have been  evaluated in few trials. We found no significant difference between any of the  interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAE analyses  were based on a very low number of events with low to moderate certainty for all the  comparisons. Thus, the results have to be viewed with caution and we cannot be sure  of the ranking. For other efficacy outcomes (PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment  (PGA) 0/1) the results were similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on  quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for several of the  interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows that compared to placebo, the  biologics infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab  and brodalumab were the most effective treatments for achieving PASI 90 in people  with moderate-to-severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate- to high-certainty  evidence. This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured  from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficient for evaluation of  longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of  studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 45 years) and  high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients  seen in daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that short-term trials  provide scanty and sometimes poorly-reported safety data and thus do not provide  useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. We found no  significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs,  and the evidence for all the interventions was of low to moderate quality. In order  to provide long-term information on the safety of the treatments included in this  review, it will also be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies and  postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies. In terms of future  research, randomised trials directly comparing active agents are necessary once  high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, including  head-to-head trials amongst and between non-biological systemic agents and small  molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23  versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also  undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve  participants, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.).  Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and  researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the  interventions and the comparative safety of different agents. Editorial note: This  is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to  review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant  new evidence as it becomes available.

It may offer improved efficacy versus intravenous (IV) infliximab  formulations. METHODS: A network meta-regression was conducted using individual  patient data from two randomised trials in patients with RA, which compared CT-P13  SC with CT-P13 IV, and CT-P13 IV with reference infliximab IV. In this analysis,  CT-P13 SC was compared with CT-P13 IV, reference infliximab IV and pooled data for  both reference infliximab IV and CT-P13 IV. Outcomes included changes from baseline  in 28-joint Disease Activity Score based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP),  Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI),  and rates of remission, low disease activity or clinically meaningful improvement in  functional disability per Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI).  RESULTS: The two studies enrolled 949 patients with RA; pooled data for 840 and 751  patients were evaluable at weeks 30 and 54, respectively. For the CT-P13 SC versus  pooled IV treatment arm comparison, differences in changes from baseline in  DAS28-CRP (- 0.578; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.831, - 0.325; p < 0.0001), CDAI  (- 3.502; 95% CI - 5.715, - 1.289; p = 0.002) and SDAI (- 4.031; 95% CI - 6.385,  - 1.677; p = 0.0008) scores at 30 weeks were statistically significant in favour of  CT-P13 SC. From weeks 30 to 54, the magnitude of the differences increased and  remained statistically significant in favour of CT-P13 SC. Similar results were  observed for the comparison of CT-P13 SC with CT-P13 IV and with reference  infliximab IV. Statistically significant differences at week 30 favoured CT-P13 SC  over the pooled IV treatment arms for the proportions of patients achieving  EULAR-CRP good response, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 and ACR70  responses, DAS28-CRP-defined remission, low disease activity (DAS28-CRP, CDAI and  SDAI criteria) and clinically meaningful HAQ-DI improvement.

Since 2004, the number of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs)  for MS has grown substantially. As a result, patients, healthcare providers, and  insurers are increasingly interested in comparative efficacy and safety evaluations  to distinguish between treatment options, but head-to-head studies between DMTs are  limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to compare efficacy and safety  outcomes with the DMTs ozanimod and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) using a  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to adjust for cross-trial differences  in study design and population. METHODS: A systematic literature review was  performed to identify clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of  ozanimod compared with DMF. Individual patient-level data (IPD) for ozanimod were  obtained from the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B trials, and aggregate-level patient  data (APD) for DMF were obtained from CONFIRM and DEFINE. A MAIC is used to weight  IPD to APD based on important baseline patient characteristics considered to be  effect modifiers or prognostic factors in order to balance the covariate  distribution to establish more homogenous trial populations. Once trial populations  are determined to be sufficiently homogenous, outcomes of interest are estimated and  used to generate treatment effects between the weighted IPD and APD. We used MAIC  methodology to compare efficacy and safety outcomes of interest between ozanimod 1.0  mg once daily (OD) and DMF 240 mg twice daily (BID), including confirmed disability  progression (CDP) at 3 and 6 months, annualized relapse rate (ARR), proportion of  patients relapsed, overall adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and  discontinuations due to AEs. RESULTS: After matching patient data, baseline patient  characteristics were balanced between patients receiving ozanimod and those  receiving DMF. Compared with DMF, ozanimod demonstrated significantly improved CDP  at 3 months (hazard ratio 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.86), ARR (rate  ratio [RR] 0.80; 95% CI 0.67-0.97), proportion of patients relapsed (odds ratio [OR]  0.66; 95% CI 0.52-0.83), overall AEs (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.08-0.16), SAEs (OR 0.27; 95%  CI 0.19-0.39), and discontinuations (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.07-0.17). CDP at 6 months did  not differ significantly between the two agents (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.62-1.26).  CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment of baseline patient characteristics, the MAIC  demonstrated that the efficacy and safety of ozanimod 1.0 mg OD was superior to that  of DMF 240 mg BID. Although a MAIC is less likely to produce biased estimates than a  naïve or a standard indirect treatment comparison via a common comparator,  limitations include potential confounding due to unobserved and thus unaccounted for  baseline differences.",© 2021.

Comparative efficacy and safety  evaluation is important to key patients, healthcare providers, and health insurers;  however, head-to-head studies between MS therapies are limited. In this analysis, we  used an indirect treatment comparison method, specifically a matching-adjusted  indirect comparison (MAIC), to compare results of clinical trials of ozanimod and  DMF. In this MAIC, findings suggested that ozanimod was associated with greater  reductions of relapses, a lowered risk of disability progression at 3 months, and  improved safety outcomes compared with DMF. Although MAICs were conducted while  adjusting for important treatment-effect modifiers and/or prognostic factors, the  possibility of confounding as a result of unobserved baseline differences remains.  Such an issue can be resolved only by conducting a head-to-head treatment comparison  in a randomized clinical trial.",eng,NA,20220131,0 (Immunosuppressive Agents) 0 (Indans) 0 (Oxadiazoles) 0 (Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor Modulators) FO2303MNI2 (Dimethyl Fumarate) Z80293URPV (ozanimod),"Comparative Effectiveness Research Dimethyl Fumarate/*pharmacology Humans Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology Indans/*pharmacology Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/*drug therapy Oxadiazoles/*pharmacology Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor Modulators/pharmacology Treatment Outcome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study indirectly compared the effectiveness of  pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy+/-bevacizumab for  previously untreated non-squamous NSCLC patients without EGFR/ALK aberrations.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted  using individual patient data (IPD) from KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G (KN021 G)  (pembrolizumab + carboplatin + pemetrexed; N = 59) and KEYNOTE-189 (KN189)  (pembrolizumab + pemetrexed + platinum chemotherapy; N = 410) and published  aggregate data from IMpower 130 (atezolizumab + carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel;  N = 451) and IMpower 150 (atezolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab;  N = 356). To adjust for cross-trial differences in baseline characteristics, data  from patients randomized to pembrolizumab + chemotherapy in KN021 G/KN189 were  reweighted to match the baseline characteristics of patients randomized to  atezolizumab + chemotherapy from IMpower 130 or  atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab from IMpower 150. Outcomes included  overall survival (OS), blinded independent review-assessed progression-free survival  (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). OS and PFS follow-up were truncated to the  trial with shorter follow-up. Sensitivity analyses were conducted without truncation  of follow-up of OS and PFS. RESULTS: After matching for cross-trial differences, the  effective sample size of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy was 428 and 389 for the  IMpower 130 and IMpower 150 comparisons, respectively. The estimated HRs (95 % CIs)  of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy were 0.80  (0.67,0.95) and 0.79 (0.67,0.93) with regard to OS and PFS, respectively. For  pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab, the  estimated HR (95 % CIs) was 0.86 (0.72,1.03) for OS and 0.81 (0.68,0.96) for PFS.  For ORR, the estimated risk ratio (95 % CI) and the risk difference (95 % CI) was  0.9 (0.8,1.1) and -3.5 % (-10.0,3.1) for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus  atezolizumab + chemotherapy, respectively, and 0.8 (0.7,0.9) and -12.2 %  (-19.6,-4.8) for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus  atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab, respectively. Findings were consistent  across sensitivity analyses for both outcomes. CONCLUSION: MAIC results showed a  significantly better OS and PFS for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy compared with  atezolizumab + chemotherapy and a significantly better PFS for  pembrolizumab + chemotherapy compared with  atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab.",Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Lacking head-to-head trials, the optimal treatment for nmCRPC is  unknown, despite widely varied treatment costs. We compared the efficacy and safety  of nmCRPC treatments. METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases, regulatory  documents, and trial registries for nmCRPC trials. We included published results  and, when available, original data. We performed matching-adjusted indirect  comparison and network meta-analysis and compared treatments regarding  metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and serious adverse events. RESULTS: We  analyzed 5 trials with 4360 participants. Compared with placebo, abiraterone acetate  engendered the lowest hazard of metastasis and death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.22, 95%  credible interval [CrI] = 0.12-0.41), followed by apalutamide (HR = 0.28, 95%  CrI = 0.23-0.34), enzalutamide (HR = 0.30, 95% CrI = 0.25-0.36), and darolutamide  (HR = 0.41, 95% CrI = 0.34-0.49); darolutamide led to the lowest hazard of death  (HR = 0.69, 95% CrI = 0.53-0.90), followed by enzalutamide (HR = 0.73, 95%  CrI = 0.61-0.87) and apalutamide (HR = 0.75, 95% CrI = 0.59-0.95); darolutamide  resulted in the lowest odds of serious adverse events (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95%  CrI = 1.02-1.70), followed by enzalutamide (OR =1.43, 95% CrI = 1.08-1.89),  apalutamide (OR = 1.58, 95% CrI = 1.23-2.03), and abiraterone acetate (OR = 1.94,  95% CrI = 1.17-3.22). CONCLUSIONS: For nmCRPC, darolutamide offered optimal efficacy  and safety among approved drugs, and abiraterone acetate may offer comparable  metastasis-free survival benefit with cost savings from generic availability. Future  research is needed to more fully examine the benefit of abiraterone acetate.","© The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

This matching-adjusted indirect comparison evaluated the efficacy and safety of both  drugs after sorafenib in patients with HCC and AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. METHODS: Individual  patient data (IPD) from the CELESTIAL trial (cabozantinib) and population-level data  from the REACH-2 trial (ramucirumab) were used. To align with REACH-2, the CELESTIAL  population was limited to patients who received first-line sorafenib only and had  baseline serum AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. The IPD from CELESTIAL were weighted to balance the  distribution of 11 effect-modifying baseline characteristics with those of REACH-2.  Overall survival (OS; primary endpoint) and progression-free survival (PFS) were  compared for the CELESTIAL (matching-adjusted) and REACH-2 populations using  weighted Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and parametric (OS, Weibull; PFS, log-logistic)  modeling. Rates of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and TRAE-related  discontinuations were also compared. RESULTS: After matching and weighting, baseline  characteristics were balanced between populations (REACH-2, N = 292; CELESTIAL,  effective sample size = 105). Weighted KM estimates for OS (median [95% CI]) were  not significantly different between cabozantinib and ramucirumab (10.6 [9.5-17.3]  months versus 8.7 [7.3-10.8] months; p = 0.104), but PFS was significantly longer  for cabozantinib than for ramucirumab (5.5 [4.6-7.4] months versus 2.8 [2.7-4.1]  months; p = 0.016). Parametric modeling results were consistent with the weighted KM  analysis. Rates of some grade 3 or 4 TRAEs were lower with ramucirumab than with  cabozantinib; however, TRAE-related discontinuation rates were similar (p = 0.271).  CONCLUSION: In this MAIC, cabozantinib significantly prolonged median PFS compared  with ramucirumab after prior sorafenib treatment in patients with HCC and  AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL; rates of some grade 3 or 4 TRAEs were lower with ramucirumab than  cabozantinib but related discontinuation rates were not significantly different  between treatments.

This study compares prespecified adverse  events and metastasis-free survival associated with darolutamide vs apalutamide, and  darolutamide vs enzalutamide, via matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: Individual patient data from the phase III ARAMIS trial  (N(PLACEBO)=553; N(DAROLUTAMIDE)=943) were selected and reweighted to match the  inclusion criteria and baseline characteristics published for the phase III SPARTAN  (N(PLACEBO)=401; N(APALUTAMIDE)=806) and PROSPER (N(PLACEBO)=468;  N(ENZALUTAMIDE)=933) trials. Only baseline factors consistently reported across  trials were included as matching covariates. Both indirect comparisons matched on  age, prostate specific antigen level and doubling time, Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group performance status, Gleason score, and bone-sparing agent use. Darolutamide vs  apalutamide also matched on prior surgery and darolutamide vs enzalutamide also  matched on region. Risk differences and odds ratios were calculated for adverse  events and hazard ratios for metastasis-free survival. RESULTS: No differences in  metastasis-free survival hazard ratios were found after matching in either  comparison. However, fall, fracture and rash rates were statistically significantly  lower in favor of darolutamide vs apalutamide. Fall, dizziness, mental impairment,  fatigue and severe fatigue rates were statistically significantly lower in favor of  darolutamide vs enzalutamide. CONCLUSIONS: While metastasis-free survival did not  differ across drugs in these cross-trial indirect comparisons, darolutamide showed a  favorable safety and tolerability profile in prespecified adverse events vs  apalutamide and enzalutamide. Consideration of these adverse events is important in  clinical decision-making and treatment selection in nonmetastatic  castration-resistant prostate cancer.",NA,"Halabi, Susan Jiang, Shan Terasawa, Emi Garcia-Horton, Viviana Ayyagari, Rajeev Waldeck, A Reginald Shore, Neal",Halabi S Jiang S Terasawa E Garcia-Horton V Ayyagari R Waldeck AR Shore N,NA,"Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.

METHODS: We conducted an analysis using a Markov cohort model  with a cycle length of 1 year, life-long time horizon, and discount rate of 3% for  cost and health outcomes. We used a matching-adjusted indirect comparison to  estimate clinical outcomes using data from the EXPAND randomised controlled trial of  siponimod vs placebo and the Nordic SPMS randomised controlled trial of interferon  beta-1a vs placebo as the basis for estimates of disability progression and relapse  outcomes. We used 6-month confirmed disability progression results to estimate  disability progression in the base-case analysis. We calculated quality-adjusted  life-years (QALYs) based on an external study that administered the EQ-5D-3L  questionnaire to European patients with multiple sclerosis. We included costs (Swiss  Franc (CHF), year 2020) of drug acquisition/administration, adverse events and  disease management. We also performed a budget impact analysis to estimate the cost  over the first 3 years of introducing siponimod. RESULTS: For the base case,  siponimod resulted in mean incremental costs of CHF 84,901 (siponimod: CHF 567,838,  interferon beta-1a: CHF 482,937) and mean incremental QALYs of 1.591 (siponimod:  7.495, interferon beta-1a: 5.905), leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness  ratio of CHF 53,364 per QALY gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the  probability of the cost effectiveness of siponimod assuming a willingness-to-pay  threshold of CHF 100,000 per QALY gained was 90%. Siponimod was projected to result  in drug administration costs for siponimod of CHF 23,817,856 in the first 3 years  after introduction, accompanied by large cost offsets in drug acquisition of other  multiple sclerosis drugs. Considering drug administration, monitoring and adverse  event management costs, it was estimated to result in additional healthcare costs in  Switzerland of CHF 2,177,021. CONCLUSIONS: In the base-case analysis, we found that  siponimod may be cost effective for treating Swiss adult patients with SPMS with  active disease. The results of the cost-effectiveness analyses are valid under the  assumption that the efficacy of siponimod and the comparators on disability  progression for the overall SPMS population would be the same in the active SPMS  population.

Tisagenlecleucel is a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy with  promising efficacy and manageable safety that was approved in Japan in 2019 for the  treatment of CD19-positive r/r B cell ALL (B-ALL). However, there is no publication  assessing the cost-effectiveness of CAR-T in Japan. The objective of this study was  to assess the cost-effectiveness of a tisagenlecleucel treatment strategy compared  to a blinatumomab treatment strategy and a clofarabine combination treatment  strategy (i.e., clofarabine + cyclophosphamide + etoposide) in Japan for pediatric  and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with r/r B-ALL. A partitioned  survival model with a lifetime horizon and monthly cycle was constructed from a  Japanese public healthcare payer's perspective. Patients were distributed across the  following partitioned health states: event-free survival (EFS), progressive disease,  and death, which were informed by the EFS and overall survival (OS) data of  respective clinical trials before year 5. For the tisagenlecleucel arm, a  decision-tree structure was used to partition patients based on the infusion status;  those who discontinued prior to receiving infusion were assigned efficacy and cost  inputs of blinatumomab and those who received infusion were assigned efficacy and  costs inputs based on tisagenlecleucel-infused patients. As trial data for  blinatumomab and clofarabine ended before year 5, matching-adjusted indirect  comparisons were used to extrapolate OS between the end of trial observation and up  to year 5. All surviving patients followed the mortality risk of long-term ALL  survivors without additional risk of disease relapse after year 5, regardless of  initial treatment strategies. The model accounted for pretreatment costs, treatment  costs, adverse event costs, follow-up costs, subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic  stem cell transplantation costs, and terminal care costs. Incremental  cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per life-years (LYs) gained and ICERs per  quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were evaluated using a 2% discount rate,  and a threshold of ¥7.5 million was used to assess cost-effectiveness. Deterministic  and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The total LYs (discounted)  for tisagenlecleucel, blinatumomab, and clofarabine combination treatment strategies  were 13.3, 4.0, and 2.7 years, respectively; the corresponding QALYs were 11.6, 3.1,  and 2.1 years, respectively. The ICERs per QALY gained for tisagenlecleucel were  ¥2,035,071 versus blinatumomab and ¥2,644,702 versus clofarabine combination  therapy. Extensive sensitivity analyses supported the findings.

Inadequate response to steroid therapy for  aGVHD is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality, including among  pediatric patients, who are the focus of this study. Ruxolitinib and  remestemcel-L-rknd were evaluated for the treatment of steroid-refractory (SR) aGVHD  in two separate single-arm trials. To effectively compare the safety and efficacy of  these treatments without a head-to-head trial, a simulated treatment comparison  (STC) was conducted. Methods: Regression techniques were used to adjust individual  patient-level data from the remestemcel-L-rknd trial to mutually reported baseline  characteristics from the ruxolitinib trial. Outcomes of interest included a 28-day  overall response rate (ORR), a 28-day ORR in the grade III-IV aGVHD population, and  adverse events (AEs). Results: In the full populations, the STC of risk ratios (RRs)  found treatment with remestemcel-L-rknd to be associated with a numerical but not  statistically significant improvement in the 28-day ORR versus ruxolitinib. In the  grade III-IV aGVHD sub-group, the STC showed significantly improved 28-day ORR for  remestemcel-L-rknd versus ruxolitinib (P=0.04). Remestemcel-L-rknd was also  associated with improved safety outcomes (P<0.05) in 17 out of 30 AEs, including  hematologic events, peripheral edema, muscular weakness, nausea, back pain, and  fatigue. Conclusion: Remestemcel-L-rknd was associated with significant improvements  in day 28 ORR compared with ruxolitinib in patients with severe (grade III-IV) SR  aGVHD. Across all grades of SR aGVHD, remestemcel-L-rknd was associated with fewer  all-grade treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (27/30) available for  comparison, including the majority reaching statistical significance.",NA,"Tremblay, Gabriel Tomaras, Dimitrios Strati, Eric Forsythe, Anna",Tremblay G Tomaras D Strati E Forsythe A,NA,"Purple Squirrel Economics, New York, NY.

METHODS AND  RESULTS: Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials were  searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating SGLT2i or ARNI in HFrEF. And a  total of six trials were included. SGLT2i was found to significantly reduce the risk  of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure by 27% [hazard ratio  (HR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.80], hospitalization for heart  failure by 31% (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62-0.77), cardiovascular death by 16% (HR 0.84,  95% CI 0.74-0.95), and all-cause death by 16% (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.94) in HFrEF  only with a statistically higher risk of genital infection (risk ratio (RR) 2.78,  95% CI 1.46-5.29). The reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for  heart failure was of similar magnitude in patients with or without diabetes mellitus  (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.80 vs. HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.87) using SGLT2i. Indirect  treatment comparison showed that SGLT2i and ARNI had similar effects on primary  outcome (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82-1.06). And combination of SGLT2i and ARNI achieved a  better prognosis performance (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.89) compared with ARNI  monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2i could safely reduce cardiovascular death or  hospitalization for heart failure in HFrEF regardless of diabetes mellitus status.

We report here a MAIC of second-line MKI options for patients  with HCC previously treated with sorafenib using individual real-world data of  regorafenib and aggregate data of second-line cabozantinib from the CELESTIAL trial.  METHODS: Data from 278 patients who received regorafenib as second-line therapy  after sorafenib failure for unresectable HCC were used as IPD. Data inclusion were  adapted to those reported in the CELESTIAL trial in the subset of patients who  received sorafenib as the only prior therapy. Survival medians and rates were  obtained from Kaplan-Meier curves, and differences between regorafenib and  cabozantinib groups were explored through Cox regression adjusted for weights  originating from MAIC. RESULTS: The median OS of the weighted regorafenib group was  11.1 months (IQR: 5.6-16.4) and 11.3 (IQR: 6.7-22.4) for cabozantinib; HR 0.83  (95%CI 0.62-1.09). The median PFS of the weighted regorafenib group was 3.0 months  (IQR: 1.9-4.8) and 5.5 (IQR: 2.3-9.3) for cabozantinib; HR 0.50 (95%CI 0.41-0.62).  In the subgroup who received prior sorafenib for < 3 months, the median OS of the  regorafenib group was 6.5 months (IQR: 4.7-10.9) and 9.5 months (IQR: 5.9-18.2) for  cabozantinib; HR 0.68 (95%CI 0.39-1.16). In the subgroup receiving prior sorafenib  for 3 to < 6 months, the median OS of the regorafenib group was 8.0 months (IQR:  4.2-15.2) and 11.5 (IQR: 6.5-23.9) for cabozantinib; HR 0.66 (95%CI 0.42-1.02). In  the subgroup receiving prior sorafenib for ≥ 6 months, the median OS of the  regorafenib group was 13.4 (IQR: 8.1-46.5) and 12.3 (IQR: 6.6-22.9) for  cabozantinib; HR 0.89 (95%CI 0.52-1.51). CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed no  differences between regorafenib and cabozantinib in terms of OS. However, in earlier  progressors on prior sorafenib a larger benefit might be expected from cabozantinib  treatment.","© 2021.

In  the absence of head-to-head comparisons between second-generation tyrosine kinase  inhibitors (TKIs), the objective of this study was to indirectly compare the  efficacy of bosutinib with nilotinib and dasatinib in first-line (1L) CP-CML.  METHODS: Cross-trial heterogeneity in terms of patient baseline characteristics and  imatinib dose escalation are difficult to adjust for in network meta-analyses and  anchored matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (MAICs). Therefore, an  unanchored MAIC was performed using patient level data from bosutinib (BFORE trial)  and published aggregated data from nilotinib (ENESTnd) and dasatinib (DASISION)  trials. After matching, cytogenetic and molecular responses, and disease  progression, after a minimum follow-up of 24 months were compared between nilotinib  versus bosutinb and dasatinib versus bosutinib. RESULTS: The comparison of nilotinib  versus bosutinib resulted in no statistically significant differences for MMR at and  by 24 months, MR4 by 24 months, MR4.5 at and by 24 months, CCyR by 24 months, and  disease progression, however, a decreased odds of MR4 at 24 months in favor of  bosutinib versus nilotinib was observed. The comparison of dasatinib versus  bosutinib by 24 months resulted in no statistically significant differences for MMR,  disease progression, and CCyR, however a decreased odds of MR4.5 in favor of  bosutinib versus dasatinib was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in these analyses  bosutinib demonstrates equivalent efficacy to nilotinib and dasatinib in the  treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML.",NA,"Muresan, Bogdan Mamolo, Carla Cappelleri, Joseph C Leip, Eric Viqueira, Andrea Heeg, Bart",Muresan B Mamolo C Cappelleri JC Leip E Viqueira A Heeg B,ORCID: 0000-0001-5321-561X,"Ingress Health, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

These comparisons are of particular  interest in the areas of oncology and hematology where uncertainty in  decision-making on the inclusion of new drugs is frequently accentuated by both the  severity of the disease and the high cost of treatment. The objective of this study  was to describe how Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison methodology has been used  to date in the assessment of hematological cancer drugs by international agencies.  METHOD: Between January 2015 and October 2019, an exhaustive search was conducted of  the websites of European National Agencies that provided public information on the  assessment process. The assessments provided by these agencies were reviewed to  obtain a list of hematological cancer drugs for which the presentation of a  Matched-Adjusted Indirect Comparison was recorded. For this list of drugs, the role  of the comparison in the assessment process was analyzed for each selected agency.  RESULTS: Thirteen hematological and oncological treatments were found in which the  pharmaceutical marketing authorization holder had presented Matching-Adjusted  Indirect Comparisons: most of this information referred to the first half of 2018.  Acceptance of this methodology diverges among agencies, ranging from 50% in the case  of the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, to 40% in the  case of French National Authority for Health, to not having been taken into account  in any of the 3 cases assessed by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency  in Health Care. The main cause of non-acceptance was matching-related problems.  CONCLUSIONS: Matching- Adjusted Indirect Comparison methodology is a tool that is  being utilized in the decision-making process for assessing new hematological cancer  treatments.",Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

METHODS: A three-state (i.e.  pre-progression, post-progression, and death) partitioned survival model was used to  estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs for patients on each  treatment over a lifetime horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall  survival (OS) were based on a matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC)  that accounted for differences in trial population baseline characteristics. Mixture  cure models (MCMs) were used to account for long-term survivors. Costs included drug  acquisition and administration for the CAR T-cell therapies and conditioning  chemotherapy, apheresis, CAR T-specific monitoring, transplant, hospitalization,  adverse events, routine care, and terminal care. Health state utilities were derived  from trial and published data. Sensitivity analyses included probabilistic  sensitivity analyses (PSAs) and an analysis of extremes that assessed the results  across a vast array of combinations of parametric OS and PFS curves across the two  therapies. RESULTS: Compared to tisa-cel, axi-cel resulted in 2.31 QALYs gained and  a cost reduction of $1,407 in the base case. In the PSA, the cost per QALY gained  was ≤$31,500 in 95% of the 1,000 simulations. In the analysis of extremes, the cost  per QALY gained was ≤$7,500 in 99% of the 1,296 combinations of MCMs and ≤$40,000 in  95% of the 1,296 combinations of standard models. LIMITATIONS: In absence of  head-to-head comparative data, we relied on a MAIC, which cannot account for all  possible confounders. Moreover, some outcomes (i.e. transplantations,  hospitalizations, adverse events (AEs)) were not adjusted in the MAIC. CONCLUSIONS:  In this simulation, axi-cel was a superior treatment option as it is predicted to  achieve better outcomes at lower or minimal incremental costs versus tisa-cel.",NA,"Liu, Rongzhe Oluwole, Olalekan O Diakite, Ibrahim Botteman, Marc F Snider, Julia Thornton Locke, Frederick L",Liu R Oluwole OO Diakite I Botteman MF Snider JT Locke FL,ORCID: 0000-0001-8316-6089 ORCID: 0000-0001-8525-9641 ORCID: 0000-0001-7151-4330 ORCID: 0000-0003-2808-7163 ORCID: 0000-0003-0017-4863 ORCID: 0000-0001-9063-6691,"Pharmerit - an OPEN Health Company, Bethesda, MD, USA.

The aim of present study was to evaluate the cost  effectiveness of empagliflozin compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment of  patients with T2DM and established CVD in Greece. METHODS: A published health  economic model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes of T2DM patients  receiving empagliflozin compared to those receiving dapagliflozin. Individual  patient-level discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict time-to-event for  CV, renal, and adverse events over patients' lifetimes. Hazard ratios for  dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on each clinical event was estimated from  DECLARE-TIMI 58 and EMPA-REG OUTCOME trials' data using an indirect treatment  comparison. Following a public payer perspective, only direct medical costs related  to drug acquisition, fatal/non-fatal diabetes-related complications and adverse  events were considered (€2020). Model extrapolated outcomes included life years  (LY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs as well as incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of changes  in input data. RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, empagliflozin was associated with  longer mean survival (17.23 LY with empagliflozin vs 16.07 LY with dapagliflozin)  and reduced rate of CV mortality resulting in 0.48 more QALYs (9.27 vs 8.79), at  additional costs of €462. The generated ICER of empagliflozin was €965 per QALY  gained. Deterministic sensitivity analysis confirmed empagliflozin's cost-effective  profile. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of  empagliflozin being cost effective over dapagliflozin was 100%, at the defined  threshold of €36,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin was estimated to be  a highly cost-effective treatment option compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment  of T2DM patients with established CVD in Greece.",NA,"Gourzoulidis, George Tzanetakos, Charalampos Ioannidis, Ioannis Tsimihodimos, Vasilis Diogo, Viana Karpouzos, George Papageorgiou, Giannis Kourlaba, Georgia",Gourzoulidis G Tzanetakos C Ioannidis I Tsimihodimos V Diogo V Karpouzos G Papageorgiou G Kourlaba G,ORCID: 0000-0002-7239-9829,"ECONCARE LP, Athens, Greece. g.gourzoulidis@econcare.gr.

Other  major healthcare stakeholders, such as insurance companies and health technology  assessment agencies, while basing initial access and reimbursement decisions on RCT  results, are also keenly interested in whether results observed in idealized trial  settings will translate into comparable outcomes in real world settings-that is,  into so-called ""real world"" effectiveness. Unfortunately, evidence of real world  effectiveness for new interventions is not available at the time of initial  approval. To bridge this gap, statistical methods are available to extend the  estimated treatment effect observed in a RCT to a target population. The  generalization is done by weighting the subjects who participated in a RCT so that  the weighted trial population resembles a target population. We evaluate a variety  of alternative estimation and weight construction procedures using both simulations  and a real world data example using two clinical trials of an investigational  intervention for Alzheimer's disease.

This study aimed to develop a real-world response (rwR)  variable applicable to solid tumors and to evaluate its clinical relevance and  meaningfulness. METHODS: This retrospective study used patient cohorts with advanced  non-small cell lung cancer from a nationwide, de-identified electronic health record  (EHR)-derived database. Disease burden information abstracted manually was  classified into response categories anchored to discrete therapy lines (per  patient-line). In part 1, we quantified the feasibility and reliability of data  capture, and estimated the association between rwR status and real-world  progression-free survival (rwPFS) and real-world overall survival (rwOS). In part 2,  we investigated the correlation between published clinical trial overall response  rates (ORRs) and real-world response rates (rwRRs) from corresponding real-world  patient cohorts. RESULTS: In part 1, 85.4% of patients (N = 3248) had  at least one  radiographic assessment documented. Median abstraction time per patient-line was  15.0 min (IQR 7.8-28.1). Inter-abstractor agreement on presence/absence of at least  one assessment was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96; n = 503 patient-lines abstracted in  duplicate); inter-abstractor agreement on best confirmed response category was 0.82  (95% CI 0.78-0.86; n = 384 with at least one captured assessment). Confirmed  responders at a 3-month landmark showed significantly lower risk of death and  progression in rwOS and rwPFS analyses across all line settings. In part 2, rwRRs  (from 12 rw cohorts) showed a high correlation with trial ORRs (Spearman's  ρ = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a rwR variable generated from clinician  assessments documented in EHRs following radiographic evaluations. This variable  provides clinically meaningful information and may provide a real-world measure of  treatment effectiveness.",NA,"Ma, Xinran Bellomo, Lawrence Magee, Kelly Bennette, Caroline S Tymejczyk, Olga Samant, Meghna Tucker, Melisa Nussbaum, Nathan Bowser, Bryan E Kraut, Joshua S Bourla, Ariel Bulua",Ma X Bellomo L Magee K Bennette CS Tymejczyk O Samant M Tucker M Nussbaum N Bowser BE Kraut JS Bourla AB,ORCID: 0000-0002-7138-2638,"Flatiron Health, Inc, New York, NY, USA. xma@flatiron.com.

Recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion protein  (rFVIIIFc) and emicizumab, a humanized, bispecific antibody, are approved for  routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in severe hemophilia A. These products have  different mechanisms of action, methods of administration and treatment schedules.  In the absence of head-to-head trials, indirect treatment comparisons can provide  informative evidence on the relative efficacy of the two treatments. The aim of the  study was to compare the approved dosing regimens for each product, rFVIIIFc  individualized prophylaxis and emicizumab administered once every week (Q1W), every  2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W), based on clinical trial evidence. PATIENTS AND  METHODS: The comparison was conducted using matching-adjusted indirect comparison  since clinical evidence did not form a connected network. Individual patient data  for rFVIIIFc (A-LONG) were compared with data for emicizumab (HAVEN trial program)  for mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and proportion of patients with zero bleeds.  Safety data reported across the analyzed treatment arms were tabularized but not  formally compared. RESULTS: After matching, no significant differences were observed  between mean ABR for rFVIIIFc and emicizumab administered Q1W, Q2W or Q4W. The  proportion of patients with zero bleeds was significantly higher with rFVIIIFc  compared with emicizumab administered Q4W (51.2% versus 29.3%, respectively; odds  ratio 2.53; 95% confidence interval 1.09-5.89); no significant differences noted  when rFVIIIFc was compared with emicizumab administered Q1W or Q2W. The mean number  of adverse events expressed per participant was 1.9 for individualized prophylaxis  with rFVIIIFc and 3.7-4.0, 4.1 and 3.6 for emicizumab administered Q1W, Q2W or Q4W,  respectively. CONCLUSION: This indirect treatment comparison suggests that rFVIIIFc  individualized prophylaxis is more efficacious than emicizumab Q4W, and at least as  effective as more frequent emicizumab regimens, for the management of hemophilia A.",© 2021 Klamroth et al.,"Klamroth, Robert Wojciechowski, Piotr Aballéa, Samuel Diamand, Françoise Hakimi, Zalmai Nazir, Jameel Abad-Franch, Lydia Lethagen, Stefan Santagostino, Elena Tarantino, Michael D",Klamroth R Wojciechowski P Aballéa S Diamand F Hakimi Z Nazir J Abad-Franch L Lethagen S Santagostino E Tarantino MD,ORCID: 0000-0003-4194-8183,"Department of Internal Medicine, Hemophilia Treatment Centre, Vivantes Klinikum im  Friedrichshain, Berlin, Germany.

HAE attacks recur with  unpredictable severity and frequency throughout patients' lives; long-term  prophylaxis is essential for some patients. In the absence of head-to-head studies,  indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of long-term prophylactic agents is a valid  approach to evaluate comparative efficacy. METHODS: We conducted an ITC using data  from the placebo-controlled HELP study (assessing patients receiving lanadelumab 300  mg every 2 or 4 weeks) and the 12-week, parallel arm, crossover CHANGE study  (assessing intravenous C1-INH). Outcomes of interest were attack rate ratio (ARR)  and time to attack after day 0 (TTA0) and after day 70 (TTA70). Two ITC  methodologies were used: a Bayesian approach using study results to update  non-informative prior distributions to posterior distributions on relative treatment  effects, and a frequentist approach using patient-level data from HELP and CHANGE to  generate Poisson regressions (for ARR) and Cox models (for TTA0 and TT70). RESULTS:  Both Bayesian and frequentist analyses suggested that lanadelumab reduced HAE attack  rate by 46-73% versus intravenous C1-INH. Relative to intravenous C1-INH, risk of  first attack after day 0 was comparable between intravenous C1-INH and both  lanadelumab doses; risk of first attack after day 70 was reduced by 81-83% with  lanadelumab 300 mg every 2 weeks, compared with C1-INH. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from  these two ITC methodologies support the favorable efficacy of lanadelumab in  reducing the HAE attack rate and extending attack-free intervals in patients with  HAE.",NA,"Mendivil, Joan Malmenäs, Mia Haeussler, Katrin Hunger, Matthias Jain, Gagan Devercelli, Giovanna",Mendivil J Malmenäs M Haeussler K Hunger M Jain G Devercelli G,ORCID: 0000-0003-1139-0078,"Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG, A Takeda Company, Zurich, Switzerland.  joan.mendivil@takeda.com.

Complete resolution of NP at week 24‒26 is an unambiguous nail outcome  accessible for indirect treatment comparison of biologics. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate  the comparative efficacy of approved biologics in achieving complete resolution of  NP at week 24‒26. METHODS: A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to indirectly  compare the efficacy of six biologics in achieving complete resolution of NP at week  24‒26 in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and concomitant NP. Complete  resolution of NP was defined as a score of zero on the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index  (NAPSI), modified NAPSI (mNAPSI) or Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernails  (PGA-F). RESULTS: The probability of achieving complete resolution of NP was highest  for ixekizumab (46.5%; 95% credibility interval [CrI] 35.1‒58.0; Surface Under the  Cumulative RAnking curve [SUCRA] 97%), followed by brodalumab (37.0%; 17.0‒61.0;  79%), adalimumab (28.3%; 24.4‒32.4; 62%), guselkumab (27.7%; 21.1‒35.1; 58%),  ustekinumab (20.8%; 10.2‒35.2; 37%), and infliximab (0.8%; 0.0‒8.9; 17%).

This analysis of phase 2 data quantified the benefit and risk of zuranolone  (30mg) versus placebo and antidepressants in terms of number needed to treat (NNT)  and number needed to harm (NNH). METHODS: Rates of response, remission, and  all-cause discontinuation for zuranolone and 11 antidepressant comparators were  obtained from the zuranolone phase 2 clinical study (N=89) and a published network  meta-analysis, respectively. An indirect treatment comparison was conducted using  the Bucher method to compare zuranolone to standard-of-care. RESULTS: Zuranolone  demonstrated greater benefit compared to placebo on Day 3 (NNT range for  response=4-5, NNT for remission=10) and at Day 15 (NNT=3 for response and  remission). Compared to SSRIs and SNRIs, zuranolone at Day 15 showed improved  treatment response (NNT=4 [95% CI = 3; 16] and 5 [95% CI = 3; 25], respectively) and  remission (NNT=4 [95% CI = 2; 13] and 4 [95% CI = 2; 18], respectively). This was  accompanied by a reduction in all-cause discontinuation, with negative NNH values  (-57 and -28), respectively. LIMITATIONS: Variations in study design across the  included trials may limit the generalizability of results.

A Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison.,10.1007/s11523-021-00803-8 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab showed superior progression-free and  overall survival compared to sorafenib in the IMbrave150 trial. It would therefore  be useful to compare the efficacy of lenvatinib and that of atezolizumab plus  bevacizumab to determine if a benefit of one therapy against the other exists.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present report was to apply a matching-adjusted indirect  comparison (MAIC) to individual participant data (IPD) from patients treated with  lenvatinib outside of randomized trials, to aggregate results derived from the  IMbrave150 trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 455 patients who received  lenvatinib as first-line systemic therapy for unresectable HCC represented the  present IPD. Data inclusion were adapted to those reported in the IMbrave150 trial.  RESULTS: Overall survival on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab proved to be superior to  lenvatinib (log-rank: 0.001) with a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% confidence interval  0.46-0.75). The number needed to treat ranged between seven in the first 12 months  and five at the 15th month. CONCLUSIONS: The present MAIC highlights that the  combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is superior to lenvatinib. However,  updated data or sub-analyses of the IMbrave150 trial would provide more robust  estimates for such a treatment comparison.",NA,"Casadei-Gardini, Andrea Tada, Toshifumi Shimose, Shigeo Kumada, Takashi Niizeki, Takashi Cascinu, Stefano Cucchetti, Alessandro",Casadei-Gardini A Tada T Shimose S Kumada T Niizeki T Cascinu S Cucchetti A,ORCID: 0000-0001-6289-7202,"Università Vita-Salute, San Raffaele Hospital-IRCCS, via Olgettina 70, 20132,  Milano, Italy. casadeigardini@gmail.com.

About 3-5% of patients develop advanced CSCC (aCSCC)  and are no longer responsive to surgery or radiation therapy. The aim of this study  was to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of cemiplimab, the first  systemic therapy approved in Italy for patients with aCSCC, vs platinum-based  chemotherapy from the Italian National Health Service (SSN) perspective. METHODS: A  partitioned survival model, which included three mutually exclusive health states,  was developed to estimate costs and outcomes for patients with aCSCC, over a 30-year  time horizon (lifetime). No direct evidence of the comparative efficacy and safety  of cemiplimab versus other therapies currently exists. Therefore, a simulated  treatment comparison (STC) was conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of  cemiplimab versus chemotherapy. Individual patient data for cemiplimab were  collected from the EMPOWER-CSCC 1 trial whereas chemotherapy data were derived from  a retrospective study. In the STC a regression model was used to predict outcomes  for cemiplimab in the population observed in the comparator study. Costs of drug  acquisition/administration and management of adverse events were included. Costs and  outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)  and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) were calculated; sensitivity and scenario  analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: In the  base-case, treatment with cemiplimab was associated with a gain of 4.89 LYs and 3.99  QALYs, compared with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, resulting in an  estimated ICER of 27,821 €/LY gained and an ICUR of 34,110 €/QALY gained. Both ICER  and ICUR were below the commonly used Italian SSN willingness to pay thresholds.  CONCLUSION: The use of cemiplimab, compared with a platinum-based chemotherapy  regimen, can be considered a cost-effective option for the treatment of aCSCC  patients in Italy.",© 2021 Ghetti et al.,"Ghetti, Gianni D'Avella, Maria Claudia Pradelli, Lorenzo",Ghetti G D'Avella MC Pradelli L,ORCID: 0000-0002-7648-8917,"Department of Health Economics and Outcome Research, AdRes, Turin, Italy.

This systematic review and network meta-analysis examined efficacy and  safety of biologics and tofacitinib for moderate-to-severe UC, using vedolizumab as  reference.Methods: Relevant studies (N = 19) of vedolizumab, adalimumab, infliximab,  golimumab, ustekinumab, and tofacitinib were identified. Study design differences  were addressed by assessing efficacy outcomes conditional on response at maintenance  initiation. Primary analysis used fixed-effect models to estimate odds ratios for  efficacy and safety endpoints.Results: Compared with vedolizumab 300 mg, adalimumab  160/80 mg was associated with less clinical remission (odds ratio, 0.69 [95%  credible interval, 0.54-0.88]), and infliximab 5 mg/kg was associated with more  clinical remission (1.67 [1.16-2.42]) and response (1.63 [1.15-2.30]). Adalimumab 40  mg, golimumab 50 mg, and ustekinumab 90 mg Q12W had significantly lower clinical  remission rates during maintenance (0.62 [0.45-0.86], 0.55 [0.32-0.95], and 0.59  [0.35-0.99]) versus vedolizumab 300 mg Q8W. Response results were similar.

It is critical for researchers conducting comparative effectiveness research  (CER) to carefully consider the most appropriate data sources and comparable patient  populations. The aim of this study was to identify potential data sources and  populations for comparing to single-arm CAR-T trials CARTITUDE-1 (cilta-cel) and  KarMMa (ide-cel). METHODS: A 2-part global systematic literature search produced a  review of (1) clinical trials of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)  guideline preferred regimens in previously treated MM, and (2) real-world data  cohorts of TCE or TCR populations, published between 1/1/2015 and 12/10/2020, with  sample sizes of > 50 patients and reporting survival-related outcomes. Implications  on CER and accepted best practices are discussed. RESULTS: Nine clinical trials of  NCCN preferred regimens were identified along with five real-world data-based  publications. No clinical trials evaluated patients with TCE or TCR MM. Among the  real-world data-based publications, two evaluated patients exclusively with TCR MM,  two analyzed a mixed population of patients with TCE or TCR MM, and one publication  assessed patients exclusively with TCE MM. Real-world data treatment patterns were  heterogeneous. CONCLUSION: Current NCCN preferred regimens were not specifically  studied in TCE or TCR MM patients, although some studies do include a proportion of  these types of patients. Therefore, appropriate matching of populations using either  real-world data or patient level clinical trial data is critical to putting trials  of novel CAR-Ts (i.e., CARTITUDE-1 or KarMMa) into appropriate comparative context.",NA,"Shah, Nina Sussman, Matthew Crivera, Concetta Valluri, Satish Benner, Jennifer Jagannath, Sundar",Shah N Sussman M Crivera C Valluri S Benner J Jagannath S,NA,"University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Results from  prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing these treatments have not  yet been reported. This analysis evaluated the relative efficacy and safety of  NIVO+IPI versus DAB+TRAM, ENCO+BINI, and VEM+COBI in patients with BRAF-mutant  advanced melanoma using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). PATIENTS AND  METHODS: A systematic literature review identified RCTs for DAB+TRAM, ENCO+BINI, and  VEM+COBI in patients with BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma. Individual patient-level  data for NIVO+IPI were derived from the phase III CheckMate 067 trial (BRAF-mutant  cohort) and restricted to match the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the comparator  trials. Treatment effects for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival  (PFS) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards and time-varying hazard ratio  (HR) models. Safety outcomes (grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events) with  NIVO+IPI and the comparators were compared. RESULTS: In the Cox proportional hazards  analysis, NIVO+IPI showed improved OS compared with DAB+TRAM (HR = 0.53; 95%  confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.73), ENCO+BINI (HR = 0.60; CI, 0.42-0.85), and  VEM+COBI (HR = 0.50; CI, 0.36-0.70) for the overall study period. In the  time-varying analysis, NIVO+IPI was associated with significant improvements in OS  and PFS compared with the BRAF/MEK inhibitors 12 months after treatment initiation.  There were no significant differences between NIVO+IPI and BRAF/MEK inhibitor  treatment from 0 to 12 months. Safety outcomes favored DAB+TRAM over NIVO+IPI,  whereas NIVO+IPI was comparable to VEM+COBI. CONCLUSION: Results of this MAIC  demonstrated durable OS and PFS benefits for patients with BRAF-mutant advanced  melanoma treated with NIVO+IPI compared with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, with the greatest  benefits noted after 12 months.",Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

However, no head-to-head RCTs exist between biologics. OBJECTIVE: To perform  an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of the efficacy of biologics plus INCS versus  placebo (INCS) as a common comparator. METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane were  searched for RCTs of biologics in CRSwNP. Bucher ITCs were performed for outcomes at  week 24: nasal polyp score (NPS) (range, 0-8), nasal congestion (NC) (range, 0-3),  loss of smell (range, 0-3), University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test  (range, 0-40), total symptom score (range, 0-12), 22-item sinonasal outcome test  (range, 0-110), and responder analyses based on NPS or NC improvement of 1 point or  greater. RESULTS: Assessment of trial design, baseline characteristics, and outcome  measures suggested that ITC was feasible with four phase 3 RCTs: dupilumab SINUS-24  and SINUS-52 (NCT02912468/NCT02898454) and omalizumab POLYP 1 and POLYP 2  (NCT03280550/NCT03280537). In the intent-to-treat population, dupilumab had  significantly greater improvements from baseline to week 24 versus omalizumab across  key outcomes: NPS (least squares mean difference [95% confidence interval], -1.04  [-1.63 to -0.44]), NC (-0.35 [-0.60 to -0.11]), loss of smell (-0.66 [-0.90  to -0.42]), University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (6.70 [4.67-8.73]),  and total symptom score (-1.18 [-1.95 to -0.41]). Improvement in the 22-item  sinonasal outcome test was greater in dupilumab versus omalizumab but was not  statistically significant. Dupilumab patients were significantly more likely to  achieve ≥1-point improvement in NPS (odds ratio [95% CI] = 3.58 [1.82-7.04]) and NC  (2.13 [1.12-4.04]) versus omalizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Although ITCs have limitations,  these results demonstrated that dupilumab had consistently greater improvements in  key CRSwNP outcomes versus omalizumab at week 24.",Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is available as a natural  product (repository corticotropin injection, [RCI]; Acthar® Gel) and as synthetic  analogs. RCI is a naturally-sourced complex mixture of purified ACTH analogs and  other pituitary peptides approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration  as a monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms. RCI is commonly used in the  United States. Outside the United States, synthetic analogs of ACTH-synthetic  ACTH1-24 (tetracosactide) and synthetic ACTH1-39 (corticotropin  carboxymethyl-cellulose [CCMC])-are used. The efficacy of RCI may differ from that  of synthetic ACTH treatments based on the structure of peptide; however, no  head-to-head clinical trials have compared the efficacy of RCI and synthetic ACTH  treatments. Objective: A systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of  clinical trials was conducted to assess the comparative efficacy of RCI and  synthetic ACTH treatments in infantile spasms. Methods: A search was conducted in  MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases through September 30, 2020. Relevant  clinical trials on RCI or synthetic ACTH therapy and reporting either cessation of  spasms or resolution of hypsarrhythmia, separately or as a combined outcome were  included. A Bayesian indirect treatment comparison using a fixed-effects model was  used for comparative efficacy. Results: Of 473 citations screened, 21 studies were  reviewed qualitatively. In the indirect treatment comparison of six eligible  clinical trial studies, the odds of achieving efficacy outcomes were five to eight  times greater with RCI than with tetracosactide and 14 to 16 times greater than  CCMC. This translated to a risk reduction of 10% to 14% and 40% to 50% with RCI  versus tetracosactide and CCMC, respectively. For every two to five patients  treated, RCI improved efficacy outcomes in one additional patient compared to  synthetic ACTH (adjusted number needed-to-treat). Conclusions: Based on the  available limited evidence, results suggest RCI may be more efficacious for  infantile spasms than synthetic ACTH treatments. Our findings provide a blueprint to  inform the design of future prospective studies for the treatment of infantile  spasms.",NA,"Duchowny, Michael S Chopra, Ishveen Niewoehner, John Wan, George J Devine, Beth",Duchowny MS Chopra I Niewoehner J Wan GJ Devine B,NA,"Nicklaus Children's Hospital, Miami, FL.

METHODS: A  systematic search of databases was performed to identify trials comparing WAVE or  PUL to either an active or sham surgery control in subjects with symptomatic benign  prostatic obstruction. A controlled indirect treatment comparison based on the  approach of Bucher was performed for outcomes including International Prostate  Symptom Score and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). The durability of treatment  response was assessed by life-table analysis of freedom from retreatment through  4 years. RESULTS: Two multicenter sham-controlled trials (Rezum II Study,  NCT01912339: LIFT Study, NCT01294150) were identified. The trials employed a common  sham procedure and were similar with respect to their designs and subjects' baseline  characteristics. Comparisons on the treatment effect in excess of sham response  found non-significant differences between WAVE and PUL for symptom score [mean  difference (MD): - 1.7 points; 95% confidence interval (CI): - 4.8, 1.4] but Qmax  improvements favored WAVE [MD: 3.4 ml/sec; CI: 1.2, 5.6]. The proportion free of  retreatment through 4 years was 89.1% for WAVE versus 75.4% for PUL [log-rank  P = 0.004]. CONCLUSIONS: PUL and WAVE provide similar subjective improvements but  flow-rate improvement and durability of response seem greater for WAVE. The  confirmation of these findings in a randomized trial is warranted.","© 2021.

METHODS: Clinical  outcomes at 2 years, including no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), for patients  receiving peginterferon beta-1a 125 mcg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or GA 20 mg/ml once  daily (QD) were compared by propensity score matching analysis using individual  patient data from ADVANCE and CONFIRM phase III clinical trials. In addition,  clinical outcomes at 1-3 years for patients receiving peginterferon beta-1a Q2W or  GA 40 mg/ml three times a week (TIW) were evaluated using a matching-adjusted  comparison analysis of individual patient data from ADVANCE and the ADVANCE  extension study, ATTAIN, and aggregate patient data from the phase III GALA and the  GALA extension studies. RESULTS: Propensity-score-matched peginterferon beta-1a  patients (n = 336) had a significantly lower annualized relapse rate [ARR (0.204  versus 0.282); rate ratio = 0.724; p = 0.045], a significantly lower probability of  12-week confirmed disability worsening (10.0% versus 14.6%; hazard ratio = 0.625;  p = 0.048), and a significantly higher rate of NEDA (20.3% versus 11.5%; p = 0.047)  compared with GA 20 mg/ml QD patients after 2 years of treatment. Matching-adjusted  peginterferon beta-1a patients (effective n = 276) demonstrated a similar ARR at 1  year (0.278 versus 0.318; p = 0.375) and significantly lower ARR at 2 years (0.0901  versus 0.203; p = 0.032) and 3 years (0.109 versus 0.209; p = 0.047) compared with  GA 40 mg/ml TIW patients (n = 834).

Several recent clinical studies have investigated the feasibility of  inhaled ciprofloxacin in NCFB, whereas the results were controversial. AIM: No  antibiotic therapies have been approved for reducing exacerbations and preventing  disease progression in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) patients. Several  recent clinical studies have investigated the feasibility of inhaled ciprofloxacin  in NCFB, whereas the results were controversial. We conducted the present  meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of inhalation of  ciprofloxacin in NCFB. METHODS: Electrical databases Medline and Cochrane library  were retrieved from inception through December 2019. Randomised controlled trials  (RCT) comparing inhaled ciprofloxacin and placebo were selected. The primary  outcomes were time to first exacerbation, frequency of exacerbations and the change  in sputum Pseudomonas aeruginosa density. RESULTS: A total of five articles  involving six RCT was finally included in the analysis. The time to first  exacerbation was significantly prolonged by inhaled ciprofloxacin (hazard ratio:  0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.82), with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 23%).  Inhalation of ciprofloxacin significantly reduced frequency of exacerbations (risk  ratio: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.61-0.79) and decreased density of sputum P. aeruginosa  (weighted mean difference: -2.11 log(10) CFU/g, 95% CI: -2.96 to -1.27 log(10)  CFU/g) compared with placebo. No significant between-group differences in mortality,  adverse events and discontinuation rate were observed. Further indirect treatment  comparison showed no differences between the two types of inhaled ciprofloxacin in  all outcomes of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin inhalation treatment  significantly prolonged the time to first exacerbation, reduced the frequency of  exacerbations and decreased sputum P. aeruginosa density and was well tolerated.

This study aims to evaluate its cost-effectiveness versus LDAC alone  and azacitidine from a Canadian payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  partitioned-survival model was developed with three health states: progression-free  survival (PFS), relapse/progression and death. Clinical inputs were obtained from  the BRIGHT AML 1003 study for glasdegib and LDAC, and from the two trial  publications and indirect treatment comparison for azacitidine. Drug  acquisition/administration, disease management, adverse event and end-of-life costs  were considered. All costs were measured in Canadian dollars. Cost-effectiveness of  glasdegib + LDAC was assessed against LDAC alone in main population, and against  azacitidine by bone marrow blasts (BMB). A weighted average ICER was calculated to  represent the current treatment use of Canadian clinical practice. The  reference-case analysis was conducted probabilistically, and numerous probabilistic  scenario analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios  (ICERs) compared to LDAC alone was CAD $177,065 (a mean gain of 0.41 QALYs and an  incremental cost of CAD $72,695), to azacitidine in 20-30% and >30% BMB group were  CAD $178,201 (a mean gain of 0.34 QALYs and an incremental cost of CAD $59,889) and  dominant (a mean gain of 0.28 QALYs while reducing costs by CAD $7,856)  respectively, resulting in a weighted average ICER of CAD $81,310 per QALY.  LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Though uncertainties remain with the generated PFS  curve, the derived azacitidine curves, administration and vial wastage, the model  has been built under the best available evidence and relied on clinical opinions  where there were data gaps. The weighted average ICER suggests that glasdegib + LDAC  is cost-effective at a CAD $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.",NA,"Hu, Yannan Charaan, Majed van Oostrum, Ilse Heeg, Bart Bell, Timothy",Hu Y Charaan M van Oostrum I Heeg B Bell T,ORCID: 0000-0002-9226-3232,"Ingress-Health, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

However, comparisons  between disconnected treatments are not possible without making strong assumptions.  When studies including multiple doses of the same drug are available, model-based  NMA (MBNMA) presents a novel solution to this problem by modeling a parametric  dose-response relationship within an NMA framework. In this article, we illustrate  several scenarios in which dose-response MBNMA can connect and strengthen evidence  networks. METHODS: We created illustrative data sets by removing studies or  treatments from an NMA of triptans for migraine relief. We fitted MBNMA models with  different dose-response relationships. For connected networks, we compared MBNMA  estimates with NMA estimates. For disconnected networks, we compared MBNMA estimates  with NMA estimates from an ""augmented"" network connected by adding studies or  treatments back into the data set. RESULTS: In connected networks, relative effect  estimates from MBNMA were more precise than those from NMA models (ratio of  posterior SDs NMA v. MBNMA: median = 1.13; range = 1.04-1.68). In disconnected  networks, MBNMA provided estimates for all treatments where NMA could not and were  consistent with NMA estimates from augmented networks for 15 of 18 data sets. In the  remaining 3 of 18 data sets, a more complex dose-response relationship was required  than could be fitted with the available evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Where information on  multiple doses is available, MBNMA can connect disconnected networks and increase  precision while making less strong assumptions than alternative approaches. MBNMA  relies on correct specification of the dose-response relationship, which requires  sufficient data at different doses to allow reliable estimation. We recommend that  systematic reviews for NMA search for and include evidence (including phase II  trials) on multiple doses of agents where available.",NA,"Pedder, Hugo Dias, Sofia Bennetts, Meg Boucher, Martin Welton, Nicky J",Pedder H Dias S Bennetts M Boucher M Welton NJ,ORCID: 0000-0002-7813-3749 ORCID: 0000-0002-2172-0221,"Department of Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of  Bristol, Bristol, UK.

The  2018 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations describe treatments  for BD-associated oral ulcers with mucocutaneous involvement; however, little  comparative effectiveness information for these agents is available. In the absence  of head-to-head trials, an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) could provide useful  evidence regarding comparative effectiveness of BD treatments. The purpose of this  study was to conduct a comparative systematic literature review (SLR) and similarity  assessment of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the oral  ulcer-related efficacy outcomes of EULAR-recommended treatments for BD-associated  oral ulcers to determine the feasibility of an ITC. METHODS: An SLR was performed to  identify relevant RCTs indexed in MEDLINE/Embase before May 29, 2019. RCT  similarities for the ITC were assessed based on a step-wise process recommended by  the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research. RESULTS: In  total, 317 articles were identified, of which 14 RCTs, reflecting 11  EULAR-recommended treatments, were evaluated in a similarity assessment. Number of  oral ulcers, resolution of oral ulcers, and healing time for oral ulcers were  identified as the possible oral ulcer-related outcomes. After completing the  similarity assessment of these outcomes, it was determined that a robust ITC was  infeasible for the three oral ulcer-related outcomes due to heterogeneity in  outcomes reporting, study design, and/or patient characteristics. More broadly, the  results underscore the need for and consistent use of standardized measures for oral  ulcer outcomes to facilitate comparative research. CONCLUSION: In the absence of  head-to-head RCTs and infeasibility of quantitative ITC, comparative assessments for  BD-associated oral ulcers are limited, including comparative effectiveness and  cost-effectiveness evaluations. Healthcare decision-makers must continue to base  treatment decisions on the extent and strength of available evidence (eg, robust  RCTs), clinical guidelines, real-world experience, and patient considerations.",© 2020 Nazareth et al.,"Nazareth, Tara Hart, Erin M Ronnebaum, Sarah M Mehta, Sandhya Patel, Dipen A Kötter, Ina",Nazareth T Hart EM Ronnebaum SM Mehta S Patel DA Kötter I,ORCID: 0000-0003-0777-2014 ORCID: 0000-0002-6683-4804 ORCID: 0000-0003-4787-754X ORCID: 0000-0002-9212-7046 ORCID: 0000-0002-9262-005X,"Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.

A simulation study.,10.1186/s12874-020-01198-2 [doi] 21,"BACKGROUND: The use of individual patient data (IPD) in network meta-analyses (NMA)  is rapidly growing. This study aimed to determine, through simulations, the impact  of select factors on the validity and precision of NMA estimates when combining IPD  and aggregate data (AgD) relative to using AgD only. METHODS: Three analysis  strategies were compared via simulations: 1) AgD NMA without adjustments (AgD-NMA);  2) AgD NMA with meta-regression (AgD-NMA-MR); and 3) IPD-AgD NMA with  meta-regression (IPD-NMA). We compared 108 parameter permutations: number of network  nodes (3, 5 or 10); proportion of treatment comparisons informed by IPD (low, medium  or high); equal size trials (2-armed with 200 patients per arm) or larger IPD trials  (500 patients per arm); sparse or well-populated networks; and type of  effect-modification (none, constant across treatment comparisons, or exchangeable).  Data were generated over 200 simulations for each combination of parameters, each  using linear regression with Normal distributions. To assess model performance and  estimate validity, the mean squared error (MSE) and bias of treatment-effect and  covariate estimates were collected. Standard errors (SE) and percentiles were used  to compare estimate precision. RESULTS: Overall, IPD-NMA performed best in terms of  validity and precision. The median MSE was lower in the IPD-NMA in 88 of 108  scenarios (similar results otherwise). On average, the IPD-NMA median MSE was 0.54  times the median using AgD-NMA-MR. Similarly, the SEs of the IPD-NMA  treatment-effect estimates were 1/5 the size of AgD-NMA-MR SEs. The magnitude of  superior validity and precision of using IPD-NMA varied across scenarios and was  associated with the amount of IPD. Using IPD in small or sparse networks  consistently led to improved validity and precision; however, in large/dense  networks IPD tended to have negligible impact if too few IPD were included. Similar  results also apply to the meta-regression coefficient estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Our  simulation study suggests that the use of IPD in NMA will considerably improve the  validity and precision of estimates of treatment effect and regression coefficients  in the most NMA IPD data-scenarios. However, IPD may not add meaningful validity and  precision to NMAs of large and dense treatment networks when negligible IPD are  used.",NA,"Kanters, Steve Karim, Mohammad Ehsanul Thorlund, Kristian Anis, Aslam Bansback, Nick",Kanters S Karim ME Thorlund K Anis A Bansback N,ORCID: 0000-0003-0322-5398,"School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, 2206 E Mall,  Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. skanters@raincity-analytics.com.

The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of  once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of  patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycaemic control on  metformin monotherapy from a healthcare payer perspective in the UK. METHODS:  Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model.  Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects of initiation of once-weekly  semaglutide 1 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg were based on an indirect comparison  conducted using patient-level data, as there is currently no head-to-head clinical  trial comparing these therapies. Modelled patients received treatments until  glycated haemoglobin exceeded 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), at which point patients initiated  basal insulin. The analysis captured pharmacy costs and costs of diabetes-related  complications, expressed in 2019 pounds sterling (GBP). Projected outcomes were  discounted at 3.5% annually. Scenario analyses were prepared to assess uncertainty  around projected outcomes. RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with  increases in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.12 years and  0.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, compared with empagliflozin  25 mg. Projected improvements in quality and duration of life resulted from a  reduced cumulative incidence and a delayed time to onset of diabetes-related  complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with increased pharmacy costs,  but this was partially offset by avoided costs of treating complications.  Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with an increase in costs of GBP 1017 per  patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 4439 per QALY  gained. CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was projected to be a  cost-effective treatment option from a healthcare payer perspective compared with  empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK  setting.",NA,"Capehorn, Matthew Hallén, Nino Baker-Knight, James Glah, Divina Hunt, Barnaby",Capehorn M Hallén N Baker-Knight J Glah D Hunt B,ORCID: 0000-0001-5420-279X,"Rotherham Institute for Obesity, Rotherham, UK.

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: A discretely integrated condition event model was developed to evaluate the  cost-effectiveness of treatment with valbenazine and deutetrabenazine in a synthetic  cohort of 1,000 patients with TD who were receiving antipsychotic medication to  treat an underlying psychiatric disorder. Clinical inputs were derived from relevant  clinical trials or from publicly available sources. Patients were assessed over  1 year using ≥50% improvement from baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale  (AIMS) total score as the primary definition of response. Response at 1 year using  Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) score ≤2 was also assessed. Health  outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), life years, proportion  responding to treatment at 1 year, and number of psychiatric relapses. RESULTS:  Regardless of the definition used for response, patients treated with valbenazine  were more likely to have responded to treatment at 1 year, lived longer, and accrued  more QALYs than patients who received deutetrabenazine. Using the AIMS response  criterion, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $9,951/QALY for valbenazine  compared with deutetrabenazine. By comparison, using the CGIC response criterion  valbenazine dominated deutetrabenazine with valbenazine-treated patients  accumulating more QALYs (3.4 vs 3.3 years) and incurring lower lifetime costs  ($252,311 vs $283,208) than deutetrabenazine-treated patients. LIMITATIONS: There  are no head-to-head trials of valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, so probabilities of  response used in the model were calculated based on an indirect treatment comparison  of results from individual trials with one drug or the other, using only those  metrics reported across trials. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with TD, treatment with  valbenazine is highly cost-effective compared with deutetrabenazine.",NA,"Ganz, Michael L Chavan, Ameya Dhanda, Rahul Serbin, Michael Yonan, Charles",Ganz ML Chavan A Dhanda R Serbin M Yonan C,ORCID: 0000-0002-9702-2999 ORCID: 0000-0002-6941-3853 ORCID: 0000-0001-6876-7150,"Real-world Evidence, Evidera, Waltham, MA, USA.

Several approaches have been used to extend the  half-life of rFVIII to improve prophylaxis outcomes. An indirect comparison of  pivotal clinical trial data was performed to evaluate the relative efficacy of two  extended half-life therapies approved for the prophylactic treatment of  haemophilia A: recombinant FVIII-IgG(1) Fc domain fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) and  pegylated rFVIII (BAY 94-9027). METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison  (MAIC) was conducted to compare the rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis arm of the  A-LONG phase III clinical trial (n = 117) and the BAY 94-9027 approved dosing  regimens of the PROTECT VIII phase II/III study (n = 110). Following matching for  baseline characteristics, mean annualised bleeding rate (ABR) and the proportion of  patients with zero bleeds were compared for rFVIIIFc and BAY 94-9027. Additional  supportive analyses comparing rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis and the individual  prophylaxis regimens included in the PROTECT VIII group (twice weekly, and every 5  and 7 days [Q5D and Q7D]) were conducted. RESULTS: Mean ABR was lower in the  rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis group versus the BAY 94-9027 pooled prophylaxis  population (3.0 versus 4.9), providing a clinically relevant and statistically  significant difference (mean difference [MD] - 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]  - 3.5 to - 0.4). A statistically significant difference in ABR was also observed for  rFVIIIFc compared with BAY 94-9027 Q7D (3.2 versus 6.4; MD - 3.3; 95% CI - 6.4 to  - 0.2). The difference in the proportion of patients with zero bleeds between  rFVIIIFc (46.5%) and BAY 94-9027 pooled prophylaxis population (38.2%) was not  statistically significant (odds ratio 1.4; 95% CI 0.8 to 2.5). CONCLUSIONS: This  indirect treatment comparison indicates a statistically significant and clinically  relevant difference in ABR favouring individualised prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc versus  BAY 94-9027 prophylaxis. The proportion of patients with zero bleeds was numerically  greater with rFVIIIFc treatment but did not achieve statistical significance.",NA,"Hakimi, Zalmai Santagostino, Elena Postma, Maarten J Nazir, Jameel",Hakimi Z Santagostino E Postma MJ Nazir J,NA,"Sobi, Stockholm, Sweden.

This study  examined the cost-effectiveness of ceritinib vs. crizotinib in the first-line  treatment of ALK + NSCLC from a HK healthcare service provider's or government's  perspective. METHODS: Costs and effectiveness of first-line ceritinib vs. crizotinib  over a 20-year time horizon was evaluated using a partitioned survival model with  three health states (stable disease, progressed disease, and death). The efficacy  data for ceritinib were obtained from a phase 3 trial comparing ceritinib with  chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (ASCEND-4) and extrapolated  using parametric survival models. Long-term survival associated with crizotinib were  estimated using hazard ratio of crizotinib vs. ceritinib obtained from  matching-adjusted indirect comparison based on ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014 trials.  Drug acquisition, administration, adverse events costs, and medical costs associated  with each health state were obtained from public sources and converted to 2018 US  Dollars. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY)  gained were estimated for ceritinib vs. crizotinib. RESULTS: The base case results  showed that ceritinib was associated with 3.22 QALYs, 4.51 LYs, and total costs of  $157,581 over 20 years. Patients receiving crizotinib had 2.68 QALYs, 3.85 LYs, and  $150,424 total costs over the same time horizon. The incremental cost per QALY  gained for ceritinib vs crizotinib was $13,343. Results were robust to deterministic  sensitivity analyses in most scenarios.

METHODS: An anchored matching-adjusted indirect  comparison (MAIC) was conducted using pooled individual patient data (IPD) from the  ITT population in KEYNOTE-021G, KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 (n = 816) and published  aggregate data of nivolumab + ipilimumab from CheckMate 227 Part 1A (n = 793). To  adjust for cross-trial differences in baseline characteristics, data from  KEYNOTE-021G/KEYNOTE-189/KEYNOTE-407 were re-weighted to match the baseline  characteristics of CheckMate 227 Part 1A. Outcomes included OS, PFS and ORR. Base  case analyses were restricted to patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥1%, with sub-group  analyses in PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and 1-49%. RESULTS: The estimated HR (95% CI) of  pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs nivolumab + ipilimumab was 0.80 (0.59,1.09) and 0.53  (0.41,0.68) for OS and PFS, respectively. For ORR, the estimated risk ratio was 1.8  (1.3,2.4) for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs nivolumab + ipilimumab and the risk  difference was 25.5% (15.0,36.0). PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and 1-49% sub-groups showed an OS  HR of 0.89 (0.58,1.36) and 0.68 (0.46,1.01), respectively.

Across multiple treatment strategies varying in efficacy  and costs, no clinical or economic studies directly compared them. This study aims  to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of 10 commonly used pharmacologic  combination strategies for T2DM. METHODS: Based on Chinese guideline and practice,  10 three-stepwise add-on strategies were identified, which start with metformin,  then switch to metformin plus one oral drug (i.e., sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione,  α-glucosidase inhibitor, glinide, or DPP-4 inhibitor) as second line, and finally  switch to metformin plus one injection (i.e., insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonist) as  third line. A cohort of 10,000 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was  established. From a healthcare system perspective, the Cardiff model was used to  estimate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies, with clinical data sourced from a  systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 324 trials, costs from claims  data of 1164 T2DM patients, and utilities from an EQ-5D study. Outcome measures  include costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness  ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs). RESULTS: Over 40-year simulation,  the costs accumulated for a patient ranged from $7661 with strategy 1 to $14,273  with strategy 10, while the QALY gains ranged from 13.965 with strategy 1 to 14.117  with strategy 8. Strategy 7 was dominant over seven strategies (strategies 2~6,  9~10) with higher QALYs but lower costs. Additionally, at a willingness-to-pay  threshold of $30,787/QALY (i.e., 3 times GDP/capita for China), strategy 7 was  cost-effective compared with strategy 1 (ICER of strategy 7 vs. 1, $3371/QALY) and  strategy 8 (ICER of strategy 8 vs. 7, $132,790/QALY). Ranking the strategies by  ICERs and NMBs, strategy 7 provided the best value for money when compared to all  other strategies, followed by strategies 5, 9, 8, 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, and 4. Scenario  analyses showed that patients insist on pharmacologic treatments increased their  QALYs (0.456~0.653) at an acceptable range of cost increase (ICERs,  $1450/QALY~$12,360/QALY) or even at cost saving compared with those not receive  treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence-based references for diabetes  management. Our findings can be used to design the essential drug formulary, infer  clinical practice, and help the decision-maker design reimbursement policy.",NA,"Gu, Shuyan Shi, Lizheng Shao, Hui Wang, Xiaoyong Hu, Xiaoqian Gu, Yuxuan Dong, Hengjin",Gu S Shi L Shao H Wang X Hu X Gu Y Dong H,ORCID: 0000-0002-5064-7297,"Center for Health Policy and Management Studies, School of Government, Nanjing  University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.

The comparative efficacy of  HP/TAZ compared with other active topical therapies (including betamethasone  dipropionate [BD] 0.5 mg/g and calcipotriol [CAL] 50 mcg/g) is uncertain. The  cost-effectiveness of HP/TAZ compared with relevant comparators for the treatment of  patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis remains uncertain. CADTH  reanalyses estimated that HP/TAZ is associated with a gain of 0.0004  quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with BD/CAL, resulting in an  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $85,670 per QALY. This estimate of  the cost-effectiveness may be more representative of patients with a milder plaque  psoriasis than the proposed indication, who are eligible to receive topical  monotherapy and do not have access to phototherapy. CADTH illustrated that the ICERs  are highly sensitive to changes in parameter values, and thus, the  cost-effectiveness estimates for HP/TAZ in this setting should be interpreted with  caution. While the drug cost of HP/TAZ is less than the cost of the individual  components based on a per gram list prices, HP/TAZ is more expensive than other  relevant comparators such as BD/CAL.",Copyright © 2020 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,Review Book,NA,Ottawa (ON),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2020/12/01 00:00,NA,2020/12/01 00:00,NA,NBK567486 [bookaccession],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health,CADTH Common Drug Reviews,"Pharmacoeconomic Report: Halobetasol Propionate and Tazarotene (Duobrii): (Bausch  Health, Canada Inc.): Indication: Psoriasis, moderate-to-severe plaque",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
175,33555772,NA,Publisher,NA,NA,2020 Dec 1,NA,NA,"Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by spontaneous seizures  and can be associated with genetic disorders, occur secondary to conditions  affecting the central nervous system or can be due to unknown etiology. In Canada,  it has been estimated that around 300,000 people are living with epilepsy based on  The Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (September 2017). Anti-epileptic  drugs (AED) are the mainstay of pharmacological management of epilepsy. Often,  patients are treated with multiple AEDs, which are decided based on factors related  to patients (e.g., age, type and frequency of seizures, comorbidities), and drugs  (e.g., drug interactions, safety profile). Brivaracetam (BRV) is an AED in the  racetam group which was discovered as an analog to the related racetam drug  levetiracetam (LEV). Both drugs have a similar mechanism of action with a selective  and high affinity for binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A, but they may differ in  their pharmacological profiles. BRV is approved by Health Canada as adjunctive  therapy in the management of partial-onset seizures in adult patients with epilepsy  who are not satisfactorily controlled with conventional therapy. A CADTH Common Drug  Review (CDR) assessment found that, based on evidence from four multicenter placebo  controlled randomized trials, BRV demonstrated significantly greater reductions in  seizure frequency compared to placebo. In the absence of head -to head trials,  evidence regarding comparative efficacy and safety of BRV versus LEV is limited. An  indirect treatment comparison found no statistical differences between LEV and BRV  with respect to efficacy and adverse events (AE) - overall and non-behavioral-except  dizziness, which occurred at a significantly higher rate with high dose levels of  BRV. Behavioral adverse events (BAE) appear to be less prevalent in BRV than with  LEV based on evidence from pre-clinical studies and clinical studies.(,)(,) The  purpose of this report is to summarize the evidence regarding the comparative  clinical safety of BRV compared to LEV among patients with epilepsy with mental  health conditions as well as in patients with epilepsy who experienced psychiatric  or behavioral adverse events with previous LEV treatment.",Copyright © 2020 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.,"Subramonian, Anusree Farrah, Kelly",Subramonian A Farrah K,NA,NA,eng,NA,Review Book,NA,Ottawa (ON),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2020/12/01 00:00,NA,2020/12/01 00:00,NA,NBK567269 [bookaccession],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health,CADTH Rapid Response Reports,Brivaracetam versus Levetiracetam for Epilepsy: A Review of Comparative Clinical  Safety,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the absence of head-to-head trials  comparing their effectiveness, this study assessed the efficacy of upadacitinib  15 mg once-daily monotherapy/combination therapy against tofacitinib 5 mg  twice-daily combination therapy among patients with RA using matching-adjusted  indirect comparisons (MAICs). METHODS: The first of two MAICs used individual  patient data (IPD) from the 14-week SELECT-MONOTHERAPY trial (upadacitinib [n = 217]  vs. methotrexate [n = 216]) and published data from the ORAL Standard trial  (tofacitinib + methotrexate [n = 204] vs. methotrexate [n = 108]). The second MAIC  used IPD from the 26-week SELECT-COMPARE trial (upadacitinib + methotrexate  [n = 647] vs. adalimumab + methotrexate [n = 324]) and published data from ORAL  Strategy (tofacitinib + methotrexate [n = 376] vs. adalimumab + methotrexate  [n = 386]). Data from patients in the upadacitinib trials were re-weighted based on  age, sex, race, swollen joint count 66/28, tender joint count 68/28, C-reactive  protein (CRP), and patients' global assessments to match the patient characteristics  in tofacitinib trials. After matching, ACR20/50/70 and clinical remission  (SDAI[CRP] ≤ 3.3, CDAI ≤ 2.8, DAS28-ESR/CRP < 2.6) were compared for upadacitinib  vs. tofacitinib + methotrexate at month 3 and upadacitinib + methotrexate vs.  tofacitinib + methotrexate at months 3 and 6 using Wald tests. RESULTS: At month 3,  upadacitinib monotherapy patients experienced significantly larger improvement in  ACR70 compared to tofacitinib + methotrexate (mean difference in difference [DID]:  9.9%; p = 0.019), while upadacitinib + methotrexate was associated with higher ACR50  compared to tofacitinib + methotrexate (DID: 12.9%; p = 0.011). At month 6,  upadacitinib + methotrexate patients experienced significantly larger improvement in  SDAI/CDAI/DAS28-ESR clinical remission compared to tofacitinib + methotrexate, with  DIDs of 9.1% (p = 0.011), 7.5% (p = 0.038), and 11.3% (p = 0.002), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: Compared to tofacitinib combination therapy, treatment with  upadacitinib monotherapy and combination therapy were associated with improved  outcomes at 3/6 months (monotherapy: ACR70; combination: ACR50, SDAI, CDAI, and  DAS28-ESR remission).",NA,"Edwards, Christopher J Sawant, Ruta Garg, Vishvas Du, Ella X Friedman, Alan Betts, Keith A",Edwards CJ Sawant R Garg V Du EX Friedman A Betts KA,NA,"NIHR Clinical Research Facility, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation  Trust, Southampton, UK.

Outpatient and inpatient claims databases from Jan 1, 2015 to Apr 1, 2017 of  persons at least 60 years old in Shenzhen, China were merged with electronic records  of influenza vaccines and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPSV23)  from Oct 1, 2016 - May 31, 2017. Individuals who were vaccinated with influenza  between Nov 1 and Dec 31, 2016 and received PPSV23 30 days within the date of  influenza vaccination were defined as the vaccinated group. A control group  consisted of individuals that received neither of the vaccines was constructed by  matching on year of birth, sex, and district. The two outcomes were all-cause and  acute respiratory hospitalizations. Difference-in-difference (DiD) logistic  regressions that were proceeded with an entropy balancing (EB) process were used to  analyse the effectiveness of dual-vaccination. A total of 48,116 eligible  individuals were identified in the vaccinated group, which were matched by 93,692  individuals in the control group. The EB-DiD analyses estimated that  dual-vaccination was associated with lower short-term risks of all-cause (odds  ratio: 0.59, CI: 0.55-0.63) and acute respiratory (odds ratio: 0.49, CI: 0.41-0.59)  hospitalizations.",NA,"Jiang, Yawen Ye, Zhaojia Chen, Daqin Shu, Yuelong",Jiang Y Ye Z Chen D Shu Y,ORCID: 0000-0002-0498-0662,"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, People's  Republic of China.

However, the key issue was the extent to  which the benefit in PFS could translate into a prolongation of OS. Methods: We  performed a systematical literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane  Central Register of Clinical Trials and Embase, as well as meeting online archives  up to February 2020. The primary outcome was OS, and we performed indirect treatment  comparisons depend on a meta-analysis. Results: Six RCTs were eligible including  3421 breast cancer patients. Compared to the endocrine therapy alone group, adding  CDK4/6 inhibitors to endocrine therapy had significantly improved OS (HR=0.76, 95%  CI=0.68-0.85, P<0.001). Moreover, the OS advantage was consistent in patients with  different combined endocrine therapy, endocrine sensitivity status, sites of distant  metastasis, menopausal status and age. Nevertheless, more adverse events were  observed in patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. The most common grade 3-4  adverse events were neutropenia (risk ratio [RR]=37.15, 95% CI=15.33-90.04),  leucopenia (RR=25.58, 95% CI=13.23-49.46) and anaemia (RR=2.24, 95% CI=1.38-3.85).  Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggested that compared with endocrine therapy alone,  the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors significantly improved OS in patients with hormone  receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. However, the addition of  CDK4/6 inhibitors also increased the incidences of grade 3-4 adverse events.",© The author(s).,"Lin, Mingxi Chen, Yang Jin, Yizi Hu, Xichun Zhang, Jian",Lin M Chen Y Jin Y Hu X Zhang J,NA,"Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Department  of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.

There remains a paucity  of economic evaluations in NEN with the majority industry funded. Most HEEs reviewed  did not meet published health economic criteria used to assess quality.

Kleijnen  Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+,  was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper  summarises the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's critical review on the  clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, highlights the key  methodological considerations, and describes the development of the NICE guidance by  the Appraisal Committee. The CS included one relevant study, for the comparison of  R(2) versus rituximab monotherapy (R-mono): the AUGMENT trial. In addition, the  company performed an unanchored indirect comparison of R(2) versus rituximab  combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP)  and rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CVP),  using data for R(2) from the AUGMENT trial and pooled data for R-CHOP/R-CVP from the  Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) database. During the STA process,  the company provided an addendum containing evidence on only the FL population, in  line with the marketing authorisation obtained at that time, which did not include  MZL. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) presented by  the company were £27,768 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for R(2)  versus R-CHOP, £41,602 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-CVP, and £23,412 per QALY  gained for R(2) versus R-mono. The ERG's concerns included the validity of the  unanchored comparison, the unavailability of a state transition model to verify the  outcomes of the partitioned survival model, substantial uncertainty in survival  curves, and potential over-estimation of utility values. The revised ERG base case  resulted in ICERs ranging from £16,874 to £44,888 per QALY gained for R(2) versus  R-CHOP, from £23,135 to £59,810 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-CVP, and from  £18,779 to £27,156 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-mono. Substantial uncertainty  remained around these ranges. NICE recommended R(2) within its marketing  authorisation, as an option for previously treated FL (grade 1-3A) in adults,  contingent on the company providing lenalidomide according to the commercial  arrangement.",NA,"Witlox, Willem J A Grimm, Sabine E Riemsma, Rob Armstrong, Nigel Ryder, Steve Duffy, Steven Carrera, Vanesa Huertas Posadzki, Pawel Worthy, Gillian Pouwels, Xavier G L V Ramaekers, Bram L T Kleijnen, Jos Joore, Manuela A van Asselt, Antoinette D I",Witlox WJA Grimm SE Riemsma R Armstrong N Ryder S Duffy S Carrera VH Posadzki P Worthy G Pouwels XGLV Ramaekers BLT Kleijnen J Joore MA van Asselt ADI,ORCID: 0000-0001-7705-9906,"Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Medical Technology Assessment, Maastricht  University Medical Centre+, Maastricht, The Netherlands.

A very common, and closely related, scenario is where a  company has individual patient data (IPD) from its own trial, but only has published  aggregate data from a competitor's trial, and an indirect comparison of the  treatments evaluated in these two trials is required. Matching-Adjusted Indirect  Comparison (MAIC) has been developed for this situation, where we use the available  IPD to adjust for between-trial imbalances in the distributions of observed baseline  covariates between the two trials. We extend the current MAIC methodology, where we  compute the weights that satisfy the conventional method of moments and result in  the largest possible effective sample size (ESS). We show that the approach proposed  by Zubizarreta in a previous study can be used for this purpose. We derive a new  analytical result that shows why this alternative approach provides a larger ESS  than a conventional MAIC. We also derive a new formula for the maximum ESS that can  be achieved, even when permitting negative weights, when adjusting for one  covariate. This can be used as an easily computed new metric that quantifies the  difficulty in adjusting for covariates. What is already known: MAIC is an  established way to perform population adjustment in the situation where IPD is  available from one trial but only aggregate level data is available from another  trial, and an indirect comparison is required. However the effective sample size  (ESS) can be small after making the adjustment. What is new: We show that an  alternative method can result in a larger ESS. We provide new analytical results  showing why this is the case. We derive a new descriptive statistic that is based on  maximising the ESS that quantifies the difficulties in adjusting for particular  covariates. Potential impact for RSM readers outside the authors' field: Reweighting  methods for population adjustment are becoming more commonly used and their  implications for research synthesis methodology is now considerable.

This  meta-analysis assessed the rate of irAEs with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy  (I+C) versus a PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone (I) and evaluated the indirect relative risk  (RR) of I+C versus I. METHODS: The protocol of this study was registered with  PROSPERO (CRD42020139923). The pooled rates of irAEs at different grades were  calculated by a single-arm meta-analysis weighted by sample size, and RRs were  determined by direct meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS:  Overall, I+C had a lower rate of grade 3 or higher irAEs than I (7.1% vs 10.6%;  indirect RR, 0.516; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.291-0.916), although irAEs of  any grade were similar. The rate of pneumonitis with I+C was lower than the rate  with I for any grade (5.9% vs 7.1%; indirect RR, 0.217; 95% CI, 0.080-0.588) and for  grade 3 or higher. In the endocrine system, I+C was associated with a lower overall  ratein comparison with I (16.1% vs 20.1%; indirect RR, 0.260; 95% CI, 0.120-0.564),  whereas irAEs of the digestive system were similar with I+C and I. In other systems,  I+C decreased the rate of skin reactions, including rash, in comparison with I  (10.4% vs 12.9%; indirect RR, 0.474; 95% CI, 0.299-0.751). The rate of grade 3 or  higher skin reactions (excluding rash) also decreased with I+C versus I (1.1% vs  2.0%) with an indirect RR of 0.158 (95% CI, 0.032-0.765), whereas other included  irAEs were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone, a  combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of NSCLC decreased the  rates of most irAEs, such as pneumonitis and endocrine and skin reactions, and the  overall rate. LAY SUMMARY: In the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC), the addition of chemotherapy to a programmed death 1/programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-(L)1) inhibitor is a more effective option. Adding chemotherapy  might reduce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Thus, this article assesses the  rate of irAEs with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy (I+C) in comparison with a  PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone (I) and evaluates the indirect relative risk (RR) with I+C  versus I. The key finding is that in comparison with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone, a  combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of NSCLC decreases the  rates of most irAEs, such as pneumonitis and endocrine and skin reactions, and the  overall rate.",© 2020 American Cancer Society.,"Wang, Manting Liang, Hengrui Wang, Wei Zhao, Shen Cai, Xiuyu Zhao, Yi Li, Caichen Cheng, Bo Xiong, Shan Li, Jianfu He, Jianxing Liang, Wenhua",Wang M Liang H Wang W Zhao S Cai X Zhao Y Li C Cheng B Xiong S Li J He J Liang W,ORCID: 0000-0002-9926-8650 ORCID: 0000-0002-1155-5963 ORCID: 0000-0002-6207-6866 ORCID: 0000-0003-1737-8192 ORCID: 0000-0002-1391-8238,"Department of Thoracic Surgery and Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou  Medical University, Guangzhou, China.

Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract  (GIT) is usually part of a disseminated disease in AIDS patients with a low CD4  count, however with standard antiretroviral therapy (ART), a localized presentation  is more likely. It can affect any part of the GIT, mostly the duodenum and typically  as patches. Incomplete or refractory ART for HIV-strains, therapy-related side  effects, noncompliant or incomplete treatment to previous MAIC infections,  superimposed complications and comorbid opportunistic infections may result in  atypical clinical, endoscopic and histopathologic manifestations. We performed a  retrospective review study retrieving cases of MAIC in duodenal endoscopic biopsy.  We found five cases of MAIC in HIV/AIDS patients. They were males with an average  age of 40-years. They showed different histopathologic features, variable patterns  of MAIC-histiocytic infiltrates, and varying intensity of intracellular acid-fast  positive bacilli. Enterocytes vacuolization and transepithelial elimination were  also observed. Three cases were associated with cytomegalovirus and cryptococcal  infections. A case was complicated by lymphangiectasia-associated protein-losing  enteropathy. Initially, three cases were morphologically missed. Ziehl-Neelsen stain  helped reach the correct diagnosis. Pathologists have an important role in patients'  management by guiding clinicians to the correct diagnosis. Pathologists should be  aware of these different histopathologic manifestations, their potential pitfalls,  look for certain helpful clues complemented with multiple levels and special stains.  In particular, AFB stains are mandatory in all mucosal biopsy specimens from  HIV/AIDS patients regardless of their appearances.",Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In Latin America, bortezomib- or thalidomide-based regimens remain standard  of care (SoC) for this population. No head-to-head trials have compared D-VMP with  SoC regimens used in Latin America. METHODS: Propensity score matching (PSM) was  used to control for baseline differences between patient populations and compare  outcomes for D-VMP versus SoC regimens used in Latin America. Data for the D-VMP  cohort were from the D-VMP arm of the ALCYONE trial (n = 350). Data for the SoC  cohort were from the retrospective, observational Hemato-Oncology Latin America  (HOLA) study, which included patients with NDMM who did not receive a transplant  (n = 729). Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression. Exact,  optimal, and nearest-neighbor PSM were applied to pick the best-performing method.  Doubly robust estimation was the base case, since some baseline imbalances  persisted. RESULTS: All 350 patients from the D-VMP arm of ALCYONE were included in  OS/PFS analyses and 338 in ORR analysis; 478 and 324 patients, respectively, from  HOLA were included in these analyses. Naïve comparison revealed important  differences in baseline characteristics (age, chronic kidney disease, hypercalcemia,  and International Staging System [ISS] stage). After nearest-neighbor matching,  baseline characteristics, except ISS stage, were well balanced; comparisons favored  D-VMP over SoC for OS (hazard ratio = 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.66;  P = 0.002) and PFS (hazard ratio = 0.48; 95% CI 0.35-0.67; P < 0.001). After exact  matching, imbalances remained in age and ISS stage; comparisons favored D-VMP over  SoC for ORR (odds ratio = 5.44; 95% CI 2.65-11.82; P < 0.001).

Limited information is known about the effects of patient characteristics on VTE  efficacy and safety of DOACs compared with VKAs, without appropriate effect modifier  adjustment comparisons of DOACs may be biased. This study considers the effect of  variables that can modify the efficacy and safety of edoxaban and warfarin, using  patient-level data. Materials and Methods  The primary efficacy and safety outcomes  in the HOKUSAI-VTE study were VTE recurrence and clinically relevant bleeding,  respectively. Potential effect modifiers were age, creatinine clearance, and weight.  The relationship between the percentage of time in international normalized ratio  (INR) control and outcomes were considered for the warfarin arm. Univariate and  multivariate regression were performed for each patient characteristic. Results  The  relationship between treatment and VTE recurrence differed by age (interaction p   = 0.007) and by creatinine clearance ( p  = 0.05). VTE recurrence differed by age  for patients in the warfarin arm but not for those in the edoxaban arm and differed  by INR control in the warfarin arm ( p  < 0.005). A stronger relationship between  creatinine clearance and clinically relevant bleeding was found in the warfarin arm  than in the edoxaban arm ( p  = 0.04). Clinically relevant bleeding differed by the  percentage of time in INR control in the warfarin arm ( p  < 0.005). Age appeared to  be a more important effect modifier than creatinine clearance in patients with VTE.  Discussion  The finding that efficacy in older patients was greater for those taking  edoxaban than for those taking warfarin in the HOKUSAI-VTE study needs further  investigation.

We  aimed to perform a meta-analysis and an indirect treatment comparison to investigate  the efficacy and safety of different doses of SCS in subjects with COPD  exacerbation. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching different databases for  randomized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy and safety of SCS with  placebo in subjects with exacerbation of COPD. The different doses of SCS were  assigned to low-dose (ie, initial dose ≤ 40 mg prednisone equivalent/d [PE/d]),  medium-dose (initial dose = 40-100 mg PE/d, and high-dose (initial dose > 100 mg  PE/d) groups. The indirect treatment comparison was performed between low-, medium-,  and high-dose SCS groups. RESULTS: Twelve trials with 1,375 participates were  included. Compared to placebo, the risk of treatment failure was lower in the  low-dose SCS groups (risk ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.43-0.88], P = .007) and high-dose SCS  groups (risk ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.48-0.85], P = .002); the FEV(1) was significantly  improved in low-dose (mean difference 0.09 [95% CI 0.06-0.12], P < .001),  medium-dose (mean difference 0.23 [95% CI 0.02-0.44], P = .036), and high-dose SCS  groups (mean difference 0.09, [95% CI 0.03-0.15], P < .001, respectively). Regarding  safety, the incidence of hyperglycemia was higher in high-dose SCS groups versus  placebo (risk ratio 2.52 [95% CI 1.13-5.62], P = .02). The indirect comparison  between low-, medium-, and high-dose SCS found that the risk of treatment failure  and changes in FEV(1) were similar between these doses of SCS. CONCLUSIONS: This  meta-analysis indicates that low-dose SCS (initial dose ≤ 40 mg PE/d) was sufficient  and safer for treating subjects with COPD exacerbation, and it was noninferior to  higher doses of SCS (initial dose > 40 mg PE/d) in improving FEV(1) and reducing the  risk of treatment failure.

In fact, the origins of Cochrane Neonatal  precede the establishment of the collaboration. In the 1980's, the National  Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at Oxford, led by Dr. Iain Chalmers, established the  ""Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials"" (ODPT), a register of virtually all randomized  controlled trials in perinatal medicine to provide a resource for reviews of the  safety and efficacy of interventions used in perinatal care and to foster  cooperative and coordinated research efforts in the perinatal field [1]. An effort  that was clearly ahead of its time, ODPT comprised four main elements: a register of  published reports of trials; a register of unpublished trials; a register of ongoing  and planned trials; and data derived from pooled overviews (meta-analyses) of  trials. This core effort grew into the creation of the seminal books, ""Effective  Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth"" as well as ""Effective Care of the Newborn Infant""  [2,3]. As these efforts in perinatal medicine grew, Iain Chalmers thought well  beyond perinatal medicine into the creation of a worldwide collaboration that became  Cochrane [4]. The mission of the Cochrane Collaboration is to promote  evidence-informed health decision-making by producing high-quality, relevant,  accessible systematic reviews and other synthesized research evidence  (www.cochrane.org). Cochrane Neonatal has continued to be one of the most productive  review groups, publishing between 25 tpo to 40 new or updated systematic reviews  each year. The impact factor has been steadily increasing over four years and now  rivals most of the elite journals in pediatric medicine. Cochrane Neonatal has been  a worldwide effort. Currently, there are 404 reviews involving 1206 authors from 52  countries. What has Cochrane done for babies? Reviews from Cochrane Neonatal have  informed guidelines and recommendations worldwide. From January 2018 through June  2020, 77 international guidelines cited 221 Cochrane Neonatal reviews. These  recommendations have included recommendations of the use of postnatal steroids,  inhaled nitric oxide, feeding guidelines for preterm infants and other core aspects  of neonatal practice. In addition, Cochrane Reviews has been the impetus for  important research, including the large-scale trial of prophylactic indomethacin  therapy, a variety of trials of postnatal steroids, trials of emollient ointment and  probiotic trials [6]. While justifiably proud of these accomplishments, one needs to  examine the future contribution of Cochrane Neonatal to the neonatal community. The  future of Cochrane Neonatal is inexorably linked to the future of neonatal research.  Obviously, there is no synthesis of trials data if, as a community, we fail to  provide the core substrate for that research. As we look at the current trials'  environment, fewer randomized controlled trial related to neonates are being  published in recent years. A simple search of PubMed, limiting the search to  ""neonates"" and ""randomized controlled trials"" shows that in the year 2000, 321  randomized controlled trials were published. These peaked five years ago, in 2015,  with close to 900 trials being published. However, in 2018, only 791 studies are  identified. Does this decrease represent a meaningful change in the neonatal  research environment? Quite possibly. There are shifting missions of clinical  neonatology at academic medical institutions, at least in the United States, with a  focus on business aspects as well as other important competing clinical activities.  Quality improvement has taken over as one of the major activities at both private  and academic neonatal practices. Clearly, this is a needed improvement. All units at  levels need to be dedicated to improving the outcomes of the sick and fragile  population we care for. However, this need not be at the expense of formal clinical  trials. It is understandable that this approach would be taken. Newer interventions  frequently relate to complex systems of care and not the simple single  interventions. Even trials that might traditionally have been done as randomized  controlled trials, such as the introduction of a new mode of ventilation, are in  reality complex challenges to the ability of institutions to create systems to adapt  to these new technologies. Cost of doing trials has always been a barrier. The  challenging regulatory and ethical environment contributes to these problems as well  [7]. Despite these barriers, how does the research agenda of the neonatal community  move forward in the 21st Century? We need to reassess how we create and disseminate  our research findings. Innovative trial designs will allow us to address complex  issues that we may not have tackled with conventional trials. Adaptive designs may  allow us to look at potentially life-saving therapies in a way that feel more  efficient and more ethical [8]. Clarifying issues such as the use of inhaled nitric  oxide in preterm infants would be greatly served if we even knew whether or not  there are hypoxemic preterm infant who would benefit from this therapy [9]. Current  trials do not suggest so, yet current practice tells us that a significant number of  these babies will receive inhaled nitric oxide [10-13]. Adaptive design, such as  those done with trials of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), would allow us  to quickly assess whether, in fact, these therapies are life-saving and allow us to  consider whether or not further trials are needed [14,15]. Our understanding that  many interventions involve entire systems approaches does not relegate us only to  doing quality improvement work. Cluster designs may allow us to test more complex  interventions that have usually been under the purview of quality improvement  [16-18]. Cluster trials are well suited for such investigations and can be done with  the least interruption to ongoing care. Ultimately, quality improvement is the  application of the best evidence available (evidence-based medicine is ""what to do""  and evidence-based practice is ""how to do""). [19,20]. Nascent efforts, such as the  statement on ""embedding necessary research into culture and health"" (the ENRICH  statement) call for the conduct of large, efficient pragmatic trials to evaluate  neonatal outcomes, as in part called for in the ALPHA Collaboration [21,22]. This  statement envisions an international system to identify important research questions  by consulting regularly with all stakeholders, including patients, public health  professionals, researchers, providers, policy makers, regulators, funders of  industry. The ENRICH statement envisions a pathway to enable individuals,  educational institutions, hospitals and health-care facilities to confirm their  status as research-friendly by integrating an understanding of trials, other  research and critical thinking and to teaching learning and culture, as well as an  engagement with funders, professional organizations and regulatory bodies and other  stake holders to raise awareness of the value of efficient international research to  reduce barriers to large international pragmatic trials and other collaborative  studies. In the future, if trials are to be done on this scale or trials are  prospectively designed to be analyzed together, core outcome measures must be  identified and standardized. That clinical trials supply estimates of outcomes that  are relevant to patients and their families is critical. In addition, current  neonatal research evaluates many different outcomes using multiple measures. A given  measure can have multiple widely used definitions. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (or  chronic lung disease just to add to the confusion) quickly comes to mind [23,24].  The use of multiple definitions when attempting to measure the same outcome prevents  synthesis of trial results and meta-analysis and hinders efforts to refine our  estimates of effects. Towards that end, Webbe and colleagues have set out to develop  a core outcome set for neonatal research [25]. Key stakeholders in the neonatal  community reviewed multiple outcomes reported in neonatal trials and qualitative  studies. Based on consensus, key outcome measures were identified, including  survival, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain injury on imaging, retinopathy or  prematurity, gross motor ability, general cognitive ability, quality of life,  adverse events, visual impairment or blindness, hearing impairment or deafness,  chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Trials registration has to be a  continued focus of the neonatal community. Trials registration allows for systematic  reviewers to understand whether or not reporting bias has occurred [26]. It also  allows for transparent incorporation of these core outcome measures. Ultimately,  trials registration should include public reporting of all of these core outcomes  and, in the future, access to data on an individual level such that more  sophisticated individual patient data meta-analysis could occur. Lastly, there is no  reason to see clinical trials and quality improvement as separate or exclusive  activities. In fact, in the first NICQ Collaborative, conducted by Vermont Oxford  Network, participation in a trial of postnatal steroids was considered part of the  quality improvement best practices as opposed to simply choosing an as-of-yet  unproven approach to use of this potent drug [27]. What role will Cochrane Neonatal  play as we move forward in the 21st Century? As the neonatal community moves forward  with its' research agenda, Cochrane Neonatal must not only follow but also lead with  innovative approaches to synthesizing research findings. Cochrane Neonatal must  continue to work closely with guideline developers. The relationship between  systematic review production and guideline development is clearly outlined in  reports from the Institute of Medicine [28,29]. Both are essential to guideline  development; the systematic review group culling the evidence for the benefits and  harms of a given intervention and the guideline group addressing the contextual  issues of cost, feasibility, implementation and the values and preferences of  individuals and societies. Most national and international guidelines groups now  routinely use systematic reviews as the evidence basis for their guidelines and  recommendations. Examples of the partnership between Cochrane Neonatal and  international guideline development can be seen in our support of the World Health  Organization (WHO) guidelines on the use of vitamin A or the soon to be published  recommendations from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) on  cord management in preterm and term infants [30]. In the future, we need to  collaborate early in the guideline development process so that the reviews are fit  for purpose and meet the needs of the guideline developers and the end users.  Towards this end, all Cochrane Neonatal reviews now contain GRADE assessments of the  key clinical findings reported in the systematic review [31]. Addition of these  assessments addresses the critical issue of our confidence in the findings. We are  most confident in evidence provided by randomized controlled trials but this  assessment can be can be downgraded if the studies that reported on the outcome in  question had a high risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency of results, or  imprecision, or where there is evidence of reporting bias. Information provided by  GRADE assessments is seen as critical in the process of moving from the evidence to  formal recommendations [32]. We need to explore complex reviews, such as network  (NMA) or multiple treatment comparison (MCT) meta-analyses, to address issues not  formally addressed in clinical trials [33]. In conditions where there are multiple  effective interventions, it is rare for all possible interventions to have been  tested against each other [34]. A solution could be provided by network  meta-analysis, which allows for comparing all treatments with each other, even if  randomized controlled trials are not available for some treatment comparisons [34].  Network meta-analysis uses both direct (head-to-head) randomized clinical trial  (RCT) evidence as well as indirect evidence from RCTs to compare the relative  effectiveness of all included interventions [35]. However, Mills and colleagues note  that the methodological quality of MTCs may be difficult for clinicians to interpret  because the number of interventions evaluated may be large and the methodological  approaches may be complex [35]. Cochrane Neonatal must take a role in both the  creation of such analyses and the education of the neonatal community regarding the  pitfalls of such an approach. The availability of individual patient data will make  more sophisticated analyses more available to the community. Although the current  crop of individual patient data meta-analyses (including the reviews of elective  high frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide and oxygen targets) have not  differed substantially from the findings of the trials level reviews (suggesting  that, in fact, sick neonates are more alike that unalike), there still will be a  large role for individual patient data meta-analysis, at least to end the unfound  conclusions that these therapies are effective in various subgroups (be it issues of  sex, disease severity, or clinical setting) [36-39]. Future trials should take a  lesson from the NeOProM Collaborative [37,39]. Given the difficulty in generating  significant sample size and creating funding in any single environment, trials with  similar protocols should be conducted in a variety of healthcare settings with an  eye towards both study level and individual patient level meta-analysis at the  conclusion of those trials, allowing for broader contribution to the trials data,  more rapid accrual of sample size, and more precise results. We need to educate the  neonatal community regarding the use and abuse of diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests  are a critical component of healthcare but also contribute greatly to the cost of  medical care worldwide. These costs include the cost of the tests themselves and the  costs of misdiagnosis and treatment of individuals who will not benefit from those  treatments. Clinicians may have a limited understanding of diagnostic test accuracy,  the ability of a diagnostic test to distinguish between patients with and without  the disease or target condition [41,42]. Efforts such as Choosing Wisely have tried  to identify these deficiencies [40]. As Cochrane has increased the general literacy  of both the medical and general population regarding the interpretation of the  results of interventions on various diseases, so should Cochrane move forward and  improve the understanding of diagnostic testing. We need to become more efficient at  creating and maintaining our reviews. The time spent to produce systematic reviews  is far too great. In average, it takes between 2½ to 6½ years to produce a  systematic review, requiring intense time input for highly trained and expensive  experts. Innovations in the ways in which we produce systematic reviews can make the  review process more efficient by outsourcing some of the tasks or crowdsourcing to  machine learning. We need to let the crowd and machine learning innovations help us  sort the massive amounts of information needed to conduct systematic reviews. It can  also allow for ""live"" updating of critical reviews where the research landscape is  quickly changing [43]. Lastly, Cochrane Neonatal must focus more on users of the  reviews and not necessarily authors of the reviews. Current Cochrane programming  speaks of Cochrane training with an eye towards developing the skills of individuals  who will conduct systematic reviews. While this is clearly needed and laudable, the  fact of the matter is that most of the community will be ""users"" of the reviews.  Individuals who need to understand how to use and interpret the findings of  systematic reviews. These review users include clinicians, guideline developers,  policy makers and families. Incorporation of GRADE guidelines has been a huge step  in adding transparency to the level of uncertainty we have in our findings. From a  family's perspective, we need to overcome the environment of mistrust or  misunderstanding of scientific evidence and how we convey what we know, and our  uncertainty about what we know, to parents and families.",Copyright © 2020.

Population adjustment methods such as multilevel network meta-regression (ML-NMR),  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), and simulated treatment comparison  (STC) relax this assumption using individual patient data from one or more studies,  and are becoming increasingly prevalent in health technology appraisals and the  applied literature. Motivated by an applied example and two recent reviews of  applications, we undertook an extensive simulation study to assess the performance  of these methods in a range of scenarios under various failures of assumptions. We  investigated the impact of varying sample size, missing effect modifiers, strength  of effect modification and validity of the shared effect modifier assumption,  validity of extrapolation and varying between-study overlap, and different covariate  distributions and correlations. ML-NMR and STC performed similarly, eliminating bias  when the requisite assumptions were met. Serious concerns are raised for MAIC, which  performed poorly in nearly all simulation scenarios and may even increase bias  compared with standard indirect comparisons. All methods incur bias when an effect  modifier is missing, highlighting the necessity of careful selection of potential  effect modifiers prior to analysis. When all effect modifiers are included, ML-NMR  and STC are robust techniques for population adjustment. ML-NMR offers additional  advantages over MAIC and STC, including extending to larger treatment networks and  producing estimates in any target population, making this an attractive choice in a  variety of scenarios.",© 2020 The Authors.

This systematic literature review evaluated clinical evidence on treatments  for patients with R/R DLBCL ineligible for, or relapsed following, stem cell  transplantation. METHODS: We assessed the feasibility of conducting an indirect  treatment comparison (ITC) or network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the relative  efficacy and safety of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with  bendamustine + rituximab versus other relevant treatments. RESULTS: Thirty-seven  studies were identified, of which 20 were eligible [seven randomized, controlled  trials (RCTs); 13 observational/single-arm trials]. Due to a lack of RCTs, an  ITC/NMA summary of the relative efficacy and safety of the treatment options was not  possible. Only two of the seven RCTs had positive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These  findings highlight the paucity of published RCTs to establish the comparative  efficacy of treatments for transplant-ineligible R/R DLBCL and lack of standard of  care in this setting.",NA,"Thuresson, Per-Olof Vander Velde, Nancy Gupta, Palvi Talbot, Jonathan",Thuresson PO Vander Velde N Gupta P Talbot J,NA,"F.

195,33570892,NA,Publisher,NA,NA,2020 Oct,NA,NA,"CADTH’s findings remained aligned with the sponsor’s: the addition of eculizumab to  standard of care (SOC) is not a cost-effective option at a willingness-to-pay (WTP)  threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). CADTH accounted for some  limitations, including changing the model’s relapse definition, selecting an  alternate parametric distribution for time to first relapse, assuming lifelong  treatment, capturing costs associated with administration and vaccination, and  assuming eculizumab would be administered in outpatient clinics. In CADTH’s base  case, eculizumab plus SOC was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness  ratio (ICER) of $1,508,152 per QALY gained compared with SOC alone in neuromyelitis  optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody  positive. A price reduction of 96% would be required for eculizumab plus SOC to  achieve an ICER below a WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY. The results of CADTH’s  reanalysis are highly dependent on the treatment effects of eculizumab plus SOC  compared to SOC alone. Several limitations were associated with the PREVENT trial  (e.g., the absence of relevant outcomes related to subsequent relapses after the  first relapse; high rates of major protocol deviation) that could not be addressed  by CADTH. In the submitted model, the majority of the incremental clinical benefits  were found to occur beyond the trial observed period; there is high uncertainty  associated with this extrapolation. The cost-effectiveness of eculizumab compared to  rituximab, mitoxantrone, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is unknown in the  absence of both direct and indirect treatment comparisons.

METHODS: To evaluate the  methods using a Monte Carlo approach, a thousand repetitions of simulated data sets  were generated for two single-arm trials. In each repetition, researchers were  assumed to have access to individual-level patient data (IPD) for one of the trials  and the published Kaplan-Meier curve of another. First, we compared the raw data and  the reconstructed IPD using Cox regressions to determine the performance of the data  reconstruction method. Then, we evaluated alternative unanchored MAIC strategies  with varying completeness of covariates for matching in terms of bias, efficiency,  and confidence interval coverage. Finally, we proposed a bias factor-adjusted  approach to gauge the true effects when unanchored MAIC estimates might be biased  due to omitted variables. RESULTS: Reconstructed data sufficiently represented raw  data in the sense that the difference between the raw and reconstructed data was not  statistically significant over the one thousand repetitions. Also, the bias of  unanchored MAIC estimates ranged from minimal to substantial as the set of  covariates became less complete. More, the confidence interval estimates of  unanchored MAIC were suboptimal even using the complete set of covariates. Finally,  the bias factor-adjusted method we proposed substantially reduced omitted variable  bias. CONCLUSIONS: Unanchored MAIC should be used to analyze time-to-event outcomes  with caution. The bias factor may be used to gauge the true treatment effect.",NA,"Jiang, Yawen Ni, Weiyi",Jiang Y Ni W,ORCID: 0000-0002-0498-0662,"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Room 215, Mingde Garden  #6, 132 East Outer Ring Road, Pan-yu District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.  jiangyw26@mail.sysu.edu.cn.

Indirect comparison with ibrutinib in a real-world  setting. A GIMEMA-ERIC and US study.,10.1002/cam4.3470 [doi],"Limited information is available on the efficacy of front-line bendamustine and  rituximab (BR) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with reduced renal function or  coexisting conditions. We therefore analyzed a cohort of real-world patients and  performed a matched adjusted indirect comparison with a cohort of patients treated  with ibrutinib. One hundred and fifty-seven patients with creatinine clearance  (CrCl) <70 mL/min and/or CIRS score >6 were treated with BR. The median age was  72 years; 69% of patients had ≥2 comorbidities and the median CrCl was 59.8 mL/min.  17.6% of patients carried TP53 disruption. The median progression-free survival  (PFS) was 45 months; TP53 disruption was associated with a shorter PFS (P = 0.05).  The overall survival (OS) at 12, 24, and 36 months was 96.2%, 90.1%, and 79.5%,  respectively. TP53 disruption was associated with an increased risk of death  (P = 0.01). Data on 162 patients ≥65 years treated with ibrutinib were analyzed and  compared with 165 patients ≥65 years treated with BR. Factors predicting for a  longer PFS at multivariable analysis in the total patient population treated with BR  and ibrutinib were age (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10, P < 0.01) and treatment with  ibrutinib (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.93, P = 0.03). In a post hoc analysis of patients  in advanced stage, a significant PFS advantage was observed in patient who had  received ibrutinib (P = 0.03), who showed a trend for OS advantage (P = 0.08). We  arrived at the following conclusions: (a) BR is a relatively effective first-line  regimen in a real-world population of unfit patients without TP53 disruption, (b)  ibrutinib provided longer disease control than BR in patients with advanced disease  stage.",© 2020 The Authors.

This ranges from supplementing contemporary data to  increase the power of trials to cross-trial comparisons in estimating comparative  efficacy. In many cases, these approaches are performed without in-depth review of  the context of data, which may lead to bias and incorrect conclusions. METHODS: We  discuss the original 'Pocock' criteria for the use of historical data and how the  use of historical data has evolved over time. Based on these factors and personal  experience, we created a series of questions that may be asked of historical data,  prior to their use. Based on the answers to these questions, various statistical  approaches are recommended. The strategy is illustrated with a case study in  colorectal cancer. RESULTS: A number of areas need to be considered with historical  data, which we split into three categories: outcome measurement, study/patient  characteristics (including setting and inclusion/exclusion criteria), and disease  process/intervention effects. Each of these areas may introduce issues if not  appropriately handled, while some may preclude the use of historical data entirely.  We present a tool (in the form of a table) for highlighting any such issues.  Application of the tool to a colorectal cancer data set demonstrates under what  conditions historical data could be used and what the limitations of such an  analysis would be. CONCLUSION: Historical data can be a powerful tool to augment or  compare with contemporary trial data, though caution is required. We present some of  the issues that may be considered when involving historical data and what (if any)  statistical approaches may account for differences between studies. We recommend  that, where historical data are to be used in analyses, potential differences  between studies are addressed explicitly.",NA,"Hatswell, Anthony Freemantle, Nick Baio, Gianluca Lesaffre, Emmanuel van Rosmalen, Joost",Hatswell A Freemantle N Baio G Lesaffre E van Rosmalen J,ORCID: 0000-0003-1129-326X ORCID: 0000-0002-9187-244X,"Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, UK.

In this study, we  aimed to conduct a network meta-analysis for comparing the efficacy of these agents.  METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled  Trials, and ClinicalTrials databases for relevant literature, up to February 2020.  The data were collected from randomized controlled trials on regorafenib,  trifluridine/tipiracil, or fruquintinib, administered to patients with metastatic  colorectal cancer who failed on treatment with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, or  fluoropyrimidine. The primary end points, namely, the overall survival and  progression-free survival, were analyzed for subsequent network analysis using the  Review Manager and Aggregate Data Drug Information System software for performing  direct and indirect comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 7 trials were analyzed in this  study. Trifluridine/tipiracil and regorafenib proved to be superior to the placebo,  with respect to the overall survival (odds ratio: 0.38, 95% confidence interval:  0.27-0.52 for trifluridine/tipiracil; odds ratio: 0.47, 95% confidence interval:  0.26-0.84 for regorafenib) and progression-free survival (odds ratio: 0.18, 95%  confidence interval: 0.05-0.67 for trifluridine/tipiracil; odds ratio: 0.06, 95%  confidence interval: 0.04-0.09 for regorafenib). Regorafenib (80 mg) was superior to  the placebo in terms of the overall survival and progression-free survival and  inferior to trifluridine/tipiracil and fruquintinib. Network analysis revealed that  the efficacy of trifluridine/tipiracil and fruquintinib was fundamentally similar,  and both the agents were superior to regorafenib. CONCLUSION: Regorafenib (80 mg)  was superior to the placebo, but inferior to 160 mg regorafenib,  trifluridine/tipiracil, and fruquintinib. This study further revealed that the  efficiency of trifluridine/tipiracil and fruquintinib is identical, but their  toxicity profiles are different.",NA,"Gao, Zhenzhen Cao, Chenxi Bao, Yi Fan, Yaohua Chen, Gang Fu, Peng",Gao Z Cao C Bao Y Fan Y Chen G Fu P,ORCID: 0000-0002-9518-7634 ORCID: 0000-0003-2982-6300,"Department of General surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University,  Jiaxing, China.

This analysis  indirectly compares the efficacy of patisiran and inotersen on neuropathy and  quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Published results from the NEURO-TTR study of  inotersen and individual patient data from the APOLLO study of patisiran were used.  Indirect comparisons were conducted for 15-month changes in neuropathy and QOL  endpoints: modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7(Ionis,)), Norfolk Quality  of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) questionnaire, body mass index (BMI),  and Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score. Analyses were conducted under different  assumptions about the impact of missing data and to adjust for baseline differences  between studies. RESULTS: Patisiran showed significantly greater treatment effects  than inotersen for mNIS+7(Ionis) (mean difference: -12.3 [95% confidence interval:  -21.4, -3.3]), Norfolk QOL-DN (-11.3 [-19.8, -2.9]), and BMI (1.0 [0.4, 1.7]). The  proportion of patients with improvement or no change from baseline on PND score was  higher for patisiran-treated patients (odds ratio: 8.9 [4.6, 17.5]). Results were  consistent and robust across analyses and methods. CONCLUSIONS: Patisiran  demonstrated greater treatment effects on neuropathy and QOL than inotersen in  patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.",NA,"Gorevic, Peter Franklin, Jaclyn Chen, Jihong Sajeev, Gautam Wang, Jessie C H Lin, Hollis",Gorevic P Franklin J Chen J Sajeev G Wang JCH Lin H,NA,"Department of Medicine- Rheumatology, Mount Sinai Medical Center , New York City,  NY, USA.

We assessed the comparative efficacy of  different strategies for management of achalasia, through a network meta-analysis  combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: We identified six  randomized controlled trials in adults with achalasia that compared the efficacy of  pneumatic dilation (PD; n = 260), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM; n = 309), and  peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM; n = 176). Primary efficacy outcome was 1-year  treatment success (patient-reported improvement in symptoms based on validated  scores); secondary efficacy outcomes were 2-year treatment success and physiologic  improvement; safety outcomes were risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),  severe erosive esophagitis, and procedure-related serious adverse events. We  performed pairwise and network meta-analysis for all treatments, and used GRADE  criteria to appraise quality of evidence. RESULTS: Low-quality evidence, based  primarily on direct evidence, supports the use of POEM (RR [risk ratio], 1.29; 95%  confidence intervals [CI], 0.99-1.69), and LHM (RR, 1.18 [0.96-1.44]) over PD for  treatment success at 1 year; no significant difference was observed between LHM and  POEM (RR 1.09 [0.86-1.39]). The incidence of severe esophagitis after POEM, LHM, and  PD was 5.3%, 3.7%, and 1.5%, respectively. Procedure-related serious adverse event  rate after POEM, LHM, and PD was 1.4%, 6.7%, and 4.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:  POEM and LHM have comparable efficacy, and may increase treatment success as  compared to PD with low confidence in estimates. POEM may have lower rate of serious  adverse events compared to LHM and PD, but higher rate of GERD.",NA,"Facciorusso, Antonio Singh, Siddharth Abbas Fehmi, Syed M Annese, Vito Lipham, John Yadlapati, Rena",Facciorusso A Singh S Abbas Fehmi SM Annese V Lipham J Yadlapati R,ORCID: 0000-0002-2107-2156,"Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Foggia, 71100  Viale Pinto 1, Foggia, Italy. antonio.facciorusso@virgilio.it.

RWD and RWE have demonstrated the significant potential to improve the design,  planning, and execution of clinical development. Furthermore, they can feature in  the designs as either a substitute or compliment to traditional clinical trials.  However, to utilize RWD and RWE appropriately and wisely, it is critical to apply  rigorous statistical methodologies that enable the robustness of results to be  characterized and ascertained. Several statistical methodologies including exact  matching, propensity score methods, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons and  meta-analysis have been proposed for analyzing RWD. Among them, propensity score  method is one of the most commonly used methods for non-randomized trials with  indirect comparison. Although massive methodologies and examples have been published  and discussed since propensity score methods were introduced, systematic review and  discussion of how to rigorously use propensity score methods in the practical  clinical development is still deficient. This paper introduces commonly used and  emerging propensity score methods with detailed discussions of their pros and cons.  Three different case studies are presented to illustrate the practical  considerations of utilizing propensity score methods in the study design and  evaluation using real-world and historical data. Additional considerations including  selection of patient populations, endpoints, baseline covariates, propensity score  methods, sensitivity analysis and practical implementation flow in clinical  development will be discussed.",Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of  this study is to compare the efficacy  of monoclonal antibodies against the  calcitonin generelated peptide  pathway drugs in chronic migraine through an  adjusted indirect  treatment comparison, and to establish whether they can be  considered  equivalent therapeutic alternatives in this pathology. METHOD: A  bibliographic search of randomized clinical trials was performed in PubMed database  on December 26, 2019. The inclusion criteria were phase II/III randomized clinical  trials of  monoclonal antibodies against the calcitonin generelated peptide  pathway  with similar population, length of follow-up and treatment  comparator. The  reduction of at least 50% migraine-days/month was  selected as efficacy  endpoint. Chronic migraine was defined as ≥ 15  headache days/month, of which ≥ 8  were migraine-days (event duration  ≥ 4 hours). Randomized clinical trials with  different clinical chronic  migraine context and definition of disease were  excluded. An indirect  treatment comparison was developed using Bucher's method.  The  equivalent therapeutic alternatives positioning guide was used for the   evaluation of potentially equivalent alternatives. Delta value (Δ,  maximum  difference as clinical criterion of equivalence) was calculated  as half of absolute  risk reduction obtained in a meta-analysis of  randomized clinical trials included  in indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: Thirty randomized clinical trials were  found: erenumab (n =  12), fremanezumab (n = 7), galcanezumab (n = 10) and  eptinezumab (n = 1). Three studies were selected: one of erenumab, one of   fremanezumab and another of eptinezumab. The rest were not included  in indirect  treatment comparison for non-compliance of inclusion criteria.  Results of  indirect treatment comparison among different regimens of  studied drugs showed no  statistically significant differences, and the  most part of 95% confidence interval  was within calculated delta margins (Δ = 9.5%). No relevant safety differences among  the three drugs were  found. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect treatment comparison showed no  statistically  significant differences in reduction of ≥ 50% migraine days/month   between erenumab, fremanezumab and eptinezumab. Probable clinical  equivalence was  found between these drugs in terms of efficacy and  safety, therefore they could be  considered equivalent therapeutic  alternatives in chronic migraine.",Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

OBJECTIVE: We indirectly  compared the efficacy of OW semaglutide 1 mg vs once-daily (OD) empagliflozin 25 mg  in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, using  individual patient data (IPD) and meta-regression methodology. DESIGN, SETTING,  PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: IPD for patients with T2D receiving metformin  monotherapy and randomized to OW semaglutide 1 mg (SUSTAIN 2, 3, 8 trials), or to OD  empagliflozin 25 mg (PIONEER 2 trial) were included. Meta-regression analyses were  adjusted for potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers. MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcomes were change from baseline to  end-of-treatment (~1 year) in HbA1c (%-point) and body weight (kg). Responder  outcomes and other clinically relevant efficacy measures were analyzed. RESULTS:  Baseline characteristics were similar between OW semaglutide (n = 995) and  empagliflozin (n = 410). Our analyses showed that OW semaglutide significantly  reduced mean HbA1c and body weight vs empagliflozin (estimated treatment difference:  -0.61%-point [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.72; -0.49] and -1.65 kg [95% CI:  -2.22; -1.08], respectively; both P < 0.0001). Complementary analyses supported the  robustness of these results. A significantly greater proportion of patients on OW  semaglutide vs empagliflozin also achieved HbA1c targets and weight-loss responses.  CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison suggests that OW semaglutide 1 mg provides  superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight vs OD empagliflozin 25 mg in patients  with T2D when added to metformin monotherapy.",© The Author(s) 2020.

Long-term  KEYNOTE-052 data continue to demonstrate pembrolizumab's meaningful, durable, and  well-tolerated antitumor activity. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of  pembrolizumab versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine as first-line treatment for  cisplatin-ineligible patients who have PD-L1-positive tumors from a US third-party  healthcare payer's perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model  containing 3 health states (progression-free, progressed, and death) was developed.  A simulated treatment comparison and a network meta-analysis were conducted to  estimate the comparative efficacy of pembrolizumab versus carboplatin-based  chemotherapy. Overall survival, progression-free survival, time on treatment,  adverse events, and utilities were modeled using the final analyses of the  KEYNOTE-052 trial and 4 studies for carboplatin plus gemcitabine. Cost data were  estimated using US standard sources and real-world data. Deterministic,  probabilistic, and scenario analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of  the results. RESULTS: Over 20 years, pembrolizumab resulted in a mean gain of 2.58  life-years, 2.01 quality-adjusted life-years, and additional costs of $158,561,  leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $78,925/quality-adjusted  life-year compared with carboplatin plus gemcitabine. CONCLUSION: This study  suggests that pembrolizumab is cost-effective compared with carboplatin plus  gemcitabine as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic  urothelial carcinoma who are PD-L1-positive.",Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The present PEGASUS study compared  progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with D-Rd in the MAIA trial and  patients treated with common standard-of-care regimens from the Flatiron Health  electronic health record-derived deidentified database, which has data from patients  treated primarily at community-based oncology practices in the United States.  Individual-level patient data from both data sources were used to perform an  anchored indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of D-Rd to  bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (VRd) and bortezomib-dexamethasone (Vd);  lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd) was the common anchor for the ITC. Hazard ratios  (HRs) reflecting direct comparisons of PFS within MAIA (D-Rd vs Rd) and Flatiron  Health (VRd vs Rd; Vd vs Rd) were used to make ITCs for D-Rd vs VRd and Vd,  respectively. After application of MAIA inclusion/exclusion criteria and  propensity-score weighting, the Flatiron Health patients resembled the MAIA trial  population on measured baseline characteristics. Based on the direct comparison  within MAIA, treatment with D-Rd was associated with a significantly lower risk of  progression or death compared to Rd (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42, 0.71). Based on the ITCs,  D-Rd was associated with a significantly lower risk of progression or death compared  to VRd (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48, 0.98) and Vd (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.33, 0.69). In the  absence of head-to-head trials comparing D-Rd to VRd or Vd, the present ITC may help  inform treatment selection in transplant-ineligible patients with NDMM.",© 2020 The Authors.

In this study, the effectiveness of cladribine vs other approved  drugs in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) was compared by matching RCT to  observational data. METHODS: Data from the pivotal trial assessing cladribine  tablets vs placebo (CLARITY) were propensity score matched to data from the Italian  multicenter database i-MuST. This database included 3,150 patients diagnosed between  2010 and 2018 at 24 Italian MS centers who started a disease-modifying drug. The  annualized relapse rate (ARR) over 2 years from treatment start and the 24-week  confirmed disability progression were compared between patients treated with  cladribine and other approved drugs (interferon, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod,  natalizumab, and dimethyl fumarate), with comparisons with placebo as a reference.  Treatment effects were estimated by the inverse probability weighting negative  binomial regression model for ARR and Cox model for disability progression. The  treatment effect has also been evaluated according to baseline disease activity.  RESULTS: All weighted baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups.  All drugs tested had an effect vs placebo close to that detected in the RCT.  Patients treated with cladribine had a significantly lower ARR compared with  interferon (relapse ratio [RR] = 0.48; p < 0.001), glatiramer acetate (RR = 0.49; p  < 0.001), and dimethyl fumarate (RR = 0.6; p = 0.001); a similar ARR to that with  fingolimod (RR = 0.74; p = 0.24); and a significantly higher ARR than natalizumab  (RR = 2.13; p = 0.014), confirming results obtained by indirect treatment  comparisons from RCTs (network meta-analyses). The relative effect of cladribine  tablets 10 mg (cumulative dose 3.5 mg/kg over 2 years) was higher in patients with  high disease activity vs all treatments except fingolimod and natalizumab. Effects  on disability progression were largely nonsignificant, probably due to lack of power  for such analysis. CONCLUSION: In patients with RRMS, cladribine tablets showed  lower ARR compared with matched patients who started interferon, glatiramer acetate,  or dimethyl fumarate; was similar to fingolimod; and was higher than natalizumab.  The beneficial effect of cladribine tablets was generally amplified in the subgroup  of patients with high disease activity. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study  provides Class III evidence that for patients with RRMS, cladribine-treated patients  had lower ARR compared with interferon, glatiramer acetate, or dimethyl fumarate;  similar ARR compared with fingolimod; and higher ARR compared with natalizumab.","Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

However, the relative efficacy of newer IAs is uncertain. The  aim of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and safety of IAs for the  management of DKA using an indirect treatment comparison (ITC). METHODS: PubMed,  EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short-, rapid-, and long-acting IAs in  patients with DKA. The primary outcomes of interest were time taken to normalize DKA  and time taken to normalize blood glucose levels. The secondary outcomes of interest  were the amount of insulin needed to normalize DKA, the length of hospital stay, and  the number of hypoglycemic events in the intervention and comparator groups.  Bayesian ITC was performed by using the gemtc package in the R program. Continuous  outcomes are reported as mean difference (MD), and binary outcomes are reported as  odds ratios (ORs), with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). The Cochrane risk of bias  tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included RCTs. FINDINGS: Ten RCTs  randomizing 435 participants to treatment were included in this ITC. A total of 5  interventions (lispro, glargine with regular insulin [RI], glulisine, aspart, and  regular insulin) were compared for both safety and efficacy outcomes in DKA.  Glargine co-administered with regular insulin showed superiority for clinical  outcomes compared with regular insulin: consuming less time (MD, -3.1 h; 95%  CrI, -7.9 to 1.8), amount of insulin required (MD, -32 U; 95% CrI, 83.0 to 18.0),  and the length of hospitalization (MD, -0.82 day; 95% CrI, -2.7 to 1.0) to normalize  DKA. However, these results were not statistically significant. Insulin aspart had  fewer reports of hypoglycemic events (OR, 1.7; 95% CrI, 0.34 to 9.3) than regular  insulin. IMPLICATIONS: Newer IAs were found to be equally effective and safe as  regular insulin in the treatment of DKA. Thus, administering these IAs can be  considered a safe and cost-effective alternative for DKA management in non-ICU  settings. Cost-effective analysis of the newer IAs is needed because these agents  are expensive compared with regular insulin.",Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The paper, via a  meta-analysis of effects of treatment modalities when administering  chemo/radiotherapy, aims to systematically evaluate the effect of timing of  chemo/radiotherapy and surgery. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search  for clinical trials of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for patients with esophageal  cancer. Using meta-analysis, we conducted direct and adjusted indirect comparisons  of overall survival, complete resection rate (R0 resection), perioperative  mortality, leakage rate and local recurrence in patients with resectable esophageal  cancer. RESULTS: A total of 32 studies involving 7985 patients with esophageal  cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Twenty-five randomized controlled studies  indirectly compared neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy with surgery alone, while five  non-randomized controlled studies and two randomized controlled studies directly  compared neoadjuvant with adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery,  compared with surgery along with adjuvant therapy, showed a significant overall  survival advantage in our pooled analysis (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79-0.98). Directly  compared with adjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant therapy demonstrated a lower local  recurrence rate (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.43-0.74) with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 1%).  Neoadjuvant therapy, comparing to surgery with or without adjuvant therapy, showed a  significantly higher R0 resection rate (OR 2.86; 95% CI 2.02-4.04) with moderate  heterogeneity (I(2) = 38%) and no significant differences in postoperative  anastomotic leakage (P = 0.50). However, neoadjuvant therapy, compared with surgery  adjuvant therapy, significantly increased perioperative mortality in both direct and  indirect comparisons (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found that neoadjuvant therapy was  associated with higher overall survival and R0 resection rate without increasing  postoperative anastomotic leakage for patients with resectable esophageal cancer,  whereas neoadjuvant therapy was associated with higher perioperative mortality after  esophagectomy.",NA,"Xiao, Xin Hong, Hyokyoung G Zeng, Xiaoxi Yang, Yu-Shang Luan, Si-Yuan Li, Yi Chen, Long-Qi Yuan, Yong",Xiao X Hong HG Zeng X Yang YS Luan SY Li Y Chen LQ Yuan Y,NA,"Department of Thoracic Surgery, West China Hospital, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu,  Sichuan, China.

METHODS: A systematic  literature review (SLR) was conducted on 29 July 2016 (updated 26 July 2018) to  identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs assessing the treatment of  newly-diagnosed advanced-stage HL with ABVD and BEACOPP (and their variants), and  A+AVD. RESULTS: The SLR identified 62 RCTs and 42 non-RCTs. Five-year overall  survival rates for ABVD and BEACOPP were 60-97% and 84-99%, and 5-year  progression-free survival rates were 58-81% and 83-96%, respectively. Both regimens  were associated with tolerability issues and side effects. Discontinuation or dose  reduction of bleomycin resulted in fewer adverse events, without significantly  affecting efficacy. A head-to-head trial demonstrated improved efficacy for A+AVD vs  ABVD, with an acceptable tolerability profile. No data from head-to-head trials  comparing A+AVD with BEACOPP were available, and an indirect treatment  comparison was not feasible.

However,  there has been no comparison of these antibiotics. METHODS: An electronic database  search was performed, from inception to June 102,020. Randomized controlled trials  (RCT) using different intravenous antibiotics (IVA) against the ICIs after  craniotomy were considered. The primary outcome was the incidence rates of ICIs. An  indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was conducted to compare the protective effect  among the diverse antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent ICIs after craniotomy. Risk of  potential bias was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 3214 patients after craniotomy in  11 studies were included, 159 patients experienced postoperative ICI, including 33  patients in the antibacterial group and 126 in the control group. The calculate  results of meta-analysis showed that except fusidic acid, preoperative intravenous  injection of cephalosporin, clindamycin, vancomycin, and penicillin can  significantly reduce the incidence of ICI after craniotomy, and ITC showed there was  no statistically significance difference in the rates of post craniotomy ICI between  the various antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The current evidence shows that low-grade  antibacterial drugs can be selected to prevent ICI after craniotomy, but this may be  due to the limited number of studies per antibiotic. It still needs more  high-quality, large sample RCT to confirm.

While uterotonic drugs are  routinely recommended, there is ongoing debate on the ideal intervention to control  uterine bleeding. This review aims to compare the use of non-pharmacologic  treatments with peripartum hysterectomy in cases of life-threatening uncontrolled  obstetric hemorrhage. The review's objective is to use a network meta-analysis to  help prevent maternal deaths and rank the treatments according to success rates.  METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from  January 2014 until December 2018. A second search was carried out in April 2019  before the final data analysis. Network meta-analysis allows for the calculation of  the effect size between treatment groups through indirect treatment comparison.  RESULTS: We confirmed that balloon-assisted management is the best intervention for  uncontrolled postpartum bleeding with pharmacologic treatment. This is followed by  uterine artery embolization and surgical procedures, which can help avoid the need  for a hysterectomy. The balloon tamponade demonstrated lower failure rate than the  surgical procedure with odds ratio (OR) of 0.44 and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)  0.50-30.54. Uterine artery embolization had a lower risk for hysterectomy than the  surgical procedure group (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.22-2.50). CONCLUSION: For the quick  treatment of postpartum bleeding, balloon tamponade is the best method for  uncontrolled postpartum bleeding with pharmacologic treatment, followed by uterine  artery embolization and surgical procedures.",NA,"Lee, Kyung Ju Hong, Kwan Hwang, Hari Choi, Hijeong Sohn, Sangho",Lee KJ Hong K Hwang H Choi H Sohn S,NA,"Department of Public Health, Korea University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea.

METHODS: A cost-consequence analysis of the cost and  clinical response of two treatment strategies was conducted over a 2-year time  horizon. A hypothetical cohort of 10 patients with PsA initiated treatment with  secukinumab 150mg (cohort A) or adalimumab 40mg (cohort B), respectively. Patients  achieving clinical response (ACR20/50/70) at week 24 continued the initial  treatment, while patients with inadequate response switched to secukinumab 300mg.  Pharmacological costs were calculated based on SmPC (notified ex-factory price). The  lowest cost of adalimumab biosimilar was considered. Data on clinical response were  extracted from the two matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) published  comparing secukinumab vs adalimumab. Results were expressed as the cost difference  between the two cohorts (€, 2019) and were calculated for each clinical response  criteria (ACR20/50/70) and for each MAIC. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact  of potential discounts on the cost of adalimumab while maintaining the cost of  secukinumab unchanged. RESULTS: Depending on the MAIC used, the cost of initiating  biologic treatment for PsA with secukinumab 150mg was 18-33% lower than the one  estimated for adalimumab 40mg, for ACR20, 18-28% for ACR50, and 16-23% for ACR70  response rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that it would be necessary a discount of  40-60%, 40-65% and 50-75% over the adalimumab cost to compensate for the differences  in efficacy observed for ACR20/50/70, respectively, depending on the MAIC used.  CONCLUSION: In patients with PsA, secukinumab could be considered a more efficient  first-line biologic treatment compared to adalimumab, from the SNHS perspective.","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier España, S.L.U. and Sociedad Española de Reumatología y  Colegio Mexicano de Reumatología.

Population adjustment methods relax this assumption  using individual patient data from one or more studies. However, current  matching-adjusted indirect comparison and simulated treatment comparison methods are  limited to pairwise indirect comparisons and cannot predict into a specified target  population. Existing meta-regression approaches incur aggregation bias. We propose a  new method extending the standard NMA framework. An individual level regression  model is defined, and aggregate data are fitted by integrating over the covariate  distribution to form the likelihood. Motivated by the complexity of the closed form  integration, we propose a general numerical approach using quasi-Monte-Carlo  integration. Covariate correlation structures are accounted for by using copulas.  Crucially for decision making, comparisons may be provided in any target population  with a given covariate distribution. We illustrate the method with a network of  plaque psoriasis treatments. Estimated population-average treatment effects are  similar across study populations, as differences in the distributions of effect  modifiers are small. A better fit is achieved than a random effects NMA, uncertainty  is substantially reduced by explaining within- and between-study variation, and  estimates are more interpretable.","© 2020 The Authors, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics  in Society) Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the Royal Statistical  Society.","Phillippo, David M Dias, Sofia Ades, A E Belger, Mark Brnabic, Alan Schacht, Alexander Saure, Daniel Kadziola, Zbigniew Welton, Nicky J",Phillippo DM Dias S Ades AE Belger M Brnabic A Schacht A Saure D Kadziola Z Welton NJ,NA,University of Bristol UK.

This study makes these  comparisons through the use of indirect treatment comparison (ITC) methods. METHODS:  A systematic review was conducted to identify RCTs that evaluated either one of  perampanel or brivaracetam in the treatment of patients with focal-onset seizures.  The Bucher ITC method was then used to compare efficacy and safety outcomes between  perampanel and brivaracetam. Additional subgroup analyses, by levetiracetam usage  (prior or concomitant), were conducted. RESULTS: Eight RCTs (four comparing  perampanel to placebo, four comparing brivaracetam to placebo) were included in the  ITC. For patients taking concomitant levetiracetam, perampanel showed a  significantly better responder rate compared to brivaracetam [relative risk (RR) and  95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.62 (1.15, 5.99)]. For patients who had previously,  or never, taken levetiracetam, there was no difference in the responder rate. In the  overall population, both perampanel and brivaracetam were more effective than  placebo in terms of responder rate, seizure freedom, and secondarily generalized  tonic-clonic seizure responder rate; however, for these outcomes, no evidence of a  difference between perampanel and brivaracetam was found. Patients taking  brivaracetam showed significantly less dizziness compared to patients taking  perampanel. No differences for any other safety outcome were found. CONCLUSION:  Perampanel and brivaracetam are effective for the adjunctive treatment of  focal-onset seizures and display similar adverse event profiles. Perampanel  demonstrated an improved focal-onset seizure responder rate compared to brivaracetam  in patients taking concomitant levetiracetam. This may be due to the similarity in  the mechanism of action between brivaracetam and levetiracetam.",Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify  direct comparisons (head-to-head randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) and indirect  comparisons (network meta-analyses [NMAs]; indirect treatment comparisons;  meta-analyses) in patients with COPD with moderate-to-very severe airflow  limitation. Study/Analysis characteristics, eligibility criteria, patient  characteristics, and overall conclusions were extracted from relevant publications.  The review of indirect comparisons focused on NMAs reporting efficacy outcomes at 12  and 24 weeks of treatment (established durations of symptomatic studies in COPD  recommended by regulators). RESULTS: Direct comparisons: Four RCTs that provided  head-to-head comparisons of LAMA/LABA FDCs were identified, and these varied in  their study design, included patient population and reported endpoints. While some  differences in lung function outcomes were noted, where assessed, LAMA/LABA FDCs had  comparable efficacy in improving symptoms, health status, exacerbations, and  comparable safety profiles. However, the differences in study methodology and  patient characteristics between these studies made it difficult to draw  generalizable conclusions regarding the comparative effectiveness of LAMA/LABA FDCs  from the direct comparisons alone. Indirect comparisons: Six NMAs were identified  that reported indirect comparisons between LAMA/LABA FDCs; five of these were within  the pre-defined scope of this review. Although the scope of each NMA varied, all  five concluded that LAMA/LABA FDCs were generally comparable in terms of lung  function improvements, patient-reported outcomes, and safety (where assessed).  CONCLUSION: Although there were some inconsistencies between the outcomes of RCTs  and NMAs for lung function, the totality of lung function, symptoms, exacerbations,  and safety data suggests that currently available LAMA/LABA FDCs have comparable  efficacy and safety in patients with COPD and moderate-to-very severe airflow  limitation.",© 2020 Hurst et al.,"Hurst, John R Gruffydd-Jones, Kevin Biswas, Mousumi Guranlioglu, Deniz Jenkins, Martin Stjepanovic, Neda Bamrara, Arushi",Hurst JR Gruffydd-Jones K Biswas M Guranlioglu D Jenkins M Stjepanovic N Bamrara A,ORCID: 0000-0002-4651-5961 ORCID: 0000-0001-6781-7400 ORCID: 0000-0002-5688-4728 ORCID: 0000-0003-4208-409X,"UCL Respiratory, University College London, London, UK.

In evidence synthesis, therapeutic options have to be compared despite  the lack of head-to-head trials. Indirect comparisons are then widely used, although  little is known about their performance in situations where cross-trial differences  or effect modification are present. Methods. We contrast the matching adjusted  indirect comparison (MAIC), simulated treatment comparison (STC), and the method of  Bucher using a simulation study. The different methods are evaluated according to  their power and type I error rate as well as with respect to the coverage, bias, and  the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the effect estimate for practically relevant  scenarios using binary and time-to-event endpoints. In addition, we investigate how  the power planned for the head-to-head trials influences the actual power of the  indirect comparison. Results. Indirect comparisons are considerably underpowered.  None of the methods had substantially superior performance. In situations without  cross-trial differences and effect modification, MAIC and Bucher led to similar  results, while Bucher has the advantage of preserving the within-study  randomization. MAIC and STC could enhance power in some scenarios but at the cost of  a potential type I error inflation. Adjusting MAIC and STC for confounders that did  not modify the effect led to higher bias and RMSE. Conclusion. The choice of effect  modifiers in MAIC and STC influences the precision of the indirect comparison.  Therefore, a careful selection of effect modifiers is warranted. In addition, missed  differences between trials may lead to low power and partly high bias for all  considered methods, and thus, results of indirect comparisons should be interpreted  with caution.",NA,"Weber, Dorothea Jensen, Katrin Kieser, Meinhard",Weber D Jensen K Kieser M,ORCID: 0000-0003-4850-9116,"Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg,  Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

DESIGN: Systematic review and network  meta-analysis including aggregate results from reanalysed individual patient data.  DATA SOURCES: Clinical study reports and aggregate results from reanalyses of  individual patient data on key outcomes for rheumatoid arthritis provided by study  sponsors for studies conducted up to 2017, and several databases and registries from  inception up to February 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES:  Randomised controlled trials investigating patient relevant outcomes in adults with  rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological medicines in combination with  methotrexate after methotrexate failure for at least 24 weeks. RESULTS: 45 eligible  trials were identified. Combining data from clinical study reports and aggregate  results from reanalyses of individual patient data allowed extensive analyses  yielding sufficiently similar populations and homogeneous study results for network  meta-analyses, including up to 35 studies on eight biological medicines combined  with methotrexate. These analyses showed few statistically significant differences  between the combination treatments. For example, anakinra showed less benefit than  almost all the other seven biological medicines regarding clinical remission or low  disease activity (clinical disease activity index ≤2.8 or ≤10, respectively) and  certolizumab pegol showed more harm than the other seven biological medicines  regarding serious adverse events or infections. Some outcomes had very wide 95%  confidence intervals, potentially implying unidentified differences between the  eight biological medicines, but wide 95% confidence intervals were less prominent  for low disease activity, serious adverse events, and infections. Owing to a lack of  head-to-head trials, results were mainly based on indirect comparisons with a  limited number of studies, and recently approved Janus kinase inhibitors could not  be included. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with rheumatoid arthritis after methotrexate  failure, only minor differences in benefits and harms were seen between biological  medicines in combination with methotrexate. However, the analysis was hampered by a  lack of long term direct comparisons. The substantial information gain achieved by  the reanalysis of individual patient data calls for the routine availability of  individual patient data.",© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review of  randomized controlled trials followed by an indirect treatment comparison was  performed to compare the efficacy and safety of the available fixed-ratio  combinations. Main outcomes were glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change and target  achievement [<6.5% and <7.0% (<48 and <53 mmol/mol)], fasting plasma glucose,  self-monitored plasma glucose, body weight, and incidence and rate of hypoglycaemia.  RESULTS: From 4850 abstracts screened, 78 qualified for full-text article review and  two randomized controlled trials were included. Baseline characteristics were  similar in the two studies. The mean difference at 26 weeks between IDegLira and  iGlarLixi was -0.36 (95% credible intervals -0.58, -0.14) % [-3.9 (-6.3, -1.5)  mmol/mol] for HbA1c and -1.0 (-1.6, -0.4) mmol/L for fasting plasma glucose. No  significant differences were found in HbA1c target attainment, preprandial or  postprandial self-monitored plasma glucose, or body weight change. Formal  comparisons of hypoglycaemia were limited by differences in definitions between the  studies: in non-sulphonylurea users, incidence was 28% for IDegLira ('confirmed' at  ≤3.1 mmol/L); for iGlarLixi, incidence was 9% ('documented symptomatic' at  <3.0 mmol/L). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this indirect treatment comparison using two  studies suggest iGlarLixi and IDegLira appear to offer similar benefits for HbA1c  target achievement. However, the findings suggest differences in other glycaemia  results and hypoglycaemia, which may reflect differences in study design and  titration approaches.","© 2020 The Authors.

Usually, this requires a connected network. A possible approach to link a  disconnected network is to add evidence from nonrandomized comparisons, using  propensity score or matching-adjusted indirect comparisons methods. However,  nonrandomized comparisons may be associated with an unclear risk of bias. Schmitz  et al. used single-arm observational studies for bridging the gap between two  disconnected networks of treatments for multiple myeloma. We present a reanalysis of  these data using component network meta-analysis (CNMA) models entirely based on  RCTs, utilizing the fact that many of the treatments consisted of common treatment  components occurring in both networks. We discuss forward and backward strategies  for selecting appropriate CNMA models and compare the results to those obtained by  Schmitz et al. using their matching method. CNMA models provided a good fit to the  data and led to treatment rankings that were similar, though not fully equal to that  obtained by Schmitz et al. We conclude that researchers encountering a disconnected  network with treatments in different subnets having common components should  consider a CNMA model. Such models, exclusively based on evidence from RCTs, are a  promising alternative to matching approaches that require additional evidence from  observational studies. CNMA models are implemented in the R package netmeta.","© 2020 The Authors. Biometrical Journal published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The research team wanted to  determine whether or not psychological interventions are clinically effective and  cost-effective in increasing self-management and improving glycaemic control.  OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to determine the clinical effectiveness of  psychological interventions for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and people with  type 2 diabetes mellitus so that they have improved (1) glycated haemoglobin levels,  (2) diabetes self-management and (3) quality of life, and fewer depressive symptoms.  The second objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of psychological  interventions. DATA SOURCES: The following databases were accessed (searches took  place between 2003 and 2016): MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health  Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials  Register, Web of Science, and Dissertation Abstracts International. Diabetes  conference abstracts, reference lists of included studies and Clinicaltrials.gov  trial registry were also searched. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic review, aggregate  meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, individual patient data meta-analysis and  cost-effectiveness modelling were all used. Risk of bias of randomised and  non-randomised controlled trials was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins  JP, Altman DG, Gøtzsche PC, Jüni P, Moher D, Oxman AD, et al. The Cochrane  Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. BMJ  2011;343:d5928). DESIGN: Systematic review, meta-analysis, cost-effectiveness  analysis and patient and public consultation were all used. SETTING: Settings in  primary or secondary care were included. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents and children with  type 1 diabetes mellitus and adults with types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus were  included. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions used were psychological treatments,  including and not restricted to cognitive-behavioural therapy, counselling, family  therapy and psychotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glycated haemoglobin levels,  self-management behaviours, body mass index, blood pressure levels, depressive  symptoms and quality of life were all used as outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of  96 studies were included in the systematic review (n = 18,659 participants). In  random-effects meta-analysis, data on glycated haemoglobin levels were available for  seven studies conducted in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 851  participants) that demonstrated a pooled mean difference of -0.13 (95% confidence  interval -0.33 to 0.07), a non-significant decrease in favour of psychological  treatment; 18 studies conducted in adolescents/children with type 1 diabetes  mellitus (n = 2583 participants) that demonstrated a pooled mean difference of 0.00  (95% confidence interval -0.18 to 0.18), indicating no change; and 49 studies  conducted in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 12,009 participants) that  demonstrated a pooled mean difference of -0.21 (95% confidence interval -0.31 to  -0.10), equivalent to reduction in glycated haemoglobin levels of -0.33% or  ≈3.5 mmol/mol. For type 2 diabetes mellitus, there was evidence that psychological  interventions improved dietary behaviour and quality of life but not blood pressure,  body mass index or depressive symptoms. The results of the network meta-analysis,  which considers direct and indirect effects of multiple treatment comparisons,  suggest that, for adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (7 studies; 968  participants), attention control and cognitive-behavioural therapy are clinically  effective and cognitive-behavioural therapy is cost-effective. For adults with type  2 diabetes mellitus (49 studies; 12,409 participants), cognitive-behavioural therapy  and counselling are effective and cognitive-behavioural therapy is potentially  cost-effective. The results of the individual patient data meta-analysis for  adolescents/children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (9 studies; 1392 participants)  suggest that there were main effects for age and diabetes duration. For adults with  type 2 diabetes mellitus (19 studies; 3639 participants), baseline glycated  haemoglobin levels moderated treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS: Aggregate meta-analysis  was limited to glycaemic control for type 1 diabetes mellitus. It was not possible  to model cost-effectiveness for adolescents/children with type 1 diabetes mellitus  and modelling for type 2 diabetes mellitus involved substantial uncertainty. The  individual patient data meta-analysis included only 40-50% of studies. CONCLUSIONS:  This review suggests that psychological treatments offer minimal clinical benefit in  improving glycated haemoglobin levels for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  However, there was no evidence of benefit compared with control interventions in  improving glycated haemoglobin levels for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  FUTURE WORK: Future work should consider the competency of the interventionists  delivering a therapy and psychological approaches that are matched to a person and  their life course.

There are education programmes that help people with diabetes to access the  information and skills needed but managing diabetes is hard and must be done 24/7,  causing people to lose motivation. There are many emotional reasons for this. This  research team aimed to discover if talking therapies that are designed to help  people challenge their negative thoughts and feelings and be more motivated and  confident could help improve their self-management and blood glucose levels. The  team also wanted to find out if talking therapies could be good value for money and  people with diabetes were asked for their views on the research. To conduct the  research, electronic databases were searched for studies that have used talking  therapies to support diabetes management. It was found that: For adults with type 2  diabetes, talking therapies improved diabetes control by only a small amount,  although such therapies could represent value for money. People with type 2 diabetes  who had talking therapy reported improved diet and quality of life. For adults with  type 1 diabetes, some types of talking therapies could improve diabetes control,  although this result was uncertain. Talking therapies were not effective for  children or adolescents in improving diabetes control but there was not enough data  to see if the therapies improved general health and well-being.When the results were  presented to people with diabetes, they still wanted access to these treatments,  even though results of this research did not suggest, overall, that talking  therapies help improve diabetes control.Now that this research is complete, it is  suggested that future studies look at whether or not more sessions of talking  therapies should be delivered over a longer time period and whether or not the  therapies should match the needs of the person with diabetes more closely.",eng,NA,20210913,NA,"*Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Cost-Benefit Analysis Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*therapy Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*therapy Humans Motivation *Psychosocial Intervention *Psychotherapy Quality of Life/psychology Self-Management/*psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both can induce  durable responses; however, cross-trial comparisons are difficult due to differences  in study design. In this study, the registration trials of axi-cel and tisa-cel were  compared using a matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). A MAIC was performed  to adjust for differences in patient characteristics between trials. The estimates  for the ZUMA-1 (axi-cel) trial were adjusted using patient-level data to match the  study population in JULIET (tisa-cel) for key variables: International Prognostic  Index), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, stage, refractoriness or relapsed  disease, double/triple hit status, cell of origin, and number of prior lines of  therapy. The endpoints analyzed were response, overall survival (OS), and adverse  events. After adjusting for differences in patient characteristics between trials,  axi-cel was associated with a greater objective response rate (relative risk  [RR]=1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29 to 2.01) and complete response  (RR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.27) than tisa-cel among patients who underwent  infusion. The OS from infusion onward comparing axi-cel to tisa-cel had a hazard  ratio of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.83). The indirect comparison showed a higher rate  of grade 1 to 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in ZUMA-1 compared with JULIET  (RR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.55 to 2.65) and similar rates of grade ≥3 CRS and neurologic  events. In the absence of a direct head-to-head study, the MAIC statistical  technique suggests axi-cel may have superior efficacy but a greater risk of grade 1  to 2 CRS. Future real-world studies can further inform the relative efficacy and  safety of CAR T therapies in RR-LBCL.",Copyright © 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

METHODS: This study used matching-adjusted indirect  comparison (MAIC) to compare patient-reported outcomes from survey data evaluating  rosacea treatments. Outcomes of interest included percentages of patients reporting  concerns and side effects and measures of importance of the concerns and  tolerability of the side effects. Patients in each analysis (MG vs AAF and MC vs  AAF) were matched using stabilized inverse propensity scores. RESULTS: When compared  to AAF, MG-treated patients more frequently reported concerns with treatment  efficacy (54% vs 4%), application (7% vs 3%), and treatment side effects. MC-treated  patients more frequently reported concerns with treatment efficacy (61% vs 5%) and  dryness (8% vs 5%). AAF-treated patients more frequently reported concerns with cost  of treatment compared with MG (7% vs 1%) and MC (9% vs 4%). Among patients reporting  concerns, level of importance associated with these concerns was similar for  AAF-treated patients compared with MG- and MC-treated patients. When compared to  AAF-treated patients, MG-treated patients more frequently reported side effects of  dryness (26% vs 15%) and uneven skin tone (3% vs 0%), and MC-treated patients more  frequently reported side effects of burning (7% vs 3%), itching (7% vs 5%), and  redness (7% vs 5%). MG- and MC-treated patients indicated greater intolerance for  reported side effects than AAF-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: MG- and MC-treated  patients more frequently reported treatment concerns and side effects than  AAF-treated patients, and tolerability of those side effects was higher for patients  treated with AAF. While treatment cost is a more frequent concern in patients  treated with AAF, these patients less frequently reported concerns with treatment  efficacy and reported similar or greater tolerance to side effects than patients  treated with either MC or MG.

A secondary objective was to gauge the  performance of the method relative to propensity score weighting (PSW). METHODS: A  simulation study was designed based on an oncology example, where MAIC was used to  account for differences between a contemporary trial in which patients had more  favorable characteristics and a historical control. A variety of scenarios were then  tested varying the setup of the simulation study, including violating the implicit  or explicit assumptions of MAIC. RESULTS: Under ideal conditions and under a variety  of scenarios, MAIC performed well (shown by a low mean absolute error [MAE]) and was  unbiased (shown by a mean error [ME] of about zero). The performance of the method  deteriorated where the matched characteristics had low explanatory power or there  was poor overlap between studies. Only when important characteristics are not  included in the matching did the method become biased (nonzero ME). Where the method  showed poor performance, this was exaggerated if matching was also performed on the  variance (ie, higher moments). Relative to PSW, MAIC provided similar results in  most circumstances, although it exhibited slightly higher MAE and a higher chance of  exaggerating bias. CONCLUSIONS: MAIC appears well suited to adjust for cross-trial  comparisons provided the assumptions underpinning the model are met, with relatively  little efficiency loss compared with PSW.",Copyright © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes  Research.

Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) are CAR T-cell  therapies approved by regulatory bodies for certain patients with r/r DLBCL on the  basis of demonstrated treatment effects in their pivotal single-arm trials, ZUMA-1  and JULIET, respectively. In the absence of head-to-head trials, the question of  whether a valid indirect treatment comparison (ITC) between axi-cel and tisa-cel  could be performed using existing evidence is of interest to patients, physicians,  payers, and other stakeholders. This article addresses that question by summarizing  the current evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies and discussing the  challenges and limitations of potential analytical approaches associated with an  ITC. Two ITC approaches attempting to adjust for cross-trial heterogeneity between  ZUMA-1 and JULIET, matching-adjusted indirect comparison and regression-prediction  model analysis, were evaluated. After evaluating the current clinical trial data and  real-world evidence, and present and prior ITC analyses of axi-cel and tisa-cel, the  authors conclude that a valid comparative analysis is not currently feasible. The  substantial differences (e.g., timing of leukapheresis and enrollment, use of  bridging chemotherapy [90% in JULIET vs. 0% in ZUMA-1], lymphodepleting regimens)  between the two trials' designs and patient populations preclude a robust and  reliable ITC. No other approaches are able to account for such differences. The  current real-world data are still too immature to be used for ITCs. Thus, drawing  conclusions from such ITCs should be avoided to prevent misinforming treatment  choices or limiting patient access to effective treatment options. Additional data  from ongoing or future real-world studies with appropriate statistical analyses are  needed to provide insights into the comparative effectiveness and safety of these  two treatments.",NA,"Zhang, Jie Li, Junlong Ma, Qiufei Yang, Hongbo Signorovitch, James Wu, Eric",Zhang J Li J Ma Q Yang H Signorovitch J Wu E,NA,"Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA.

NAVIGATE is a manualised model of EPI with  demonstrated effectiveness consisting of four components: individualised medication  management, individual resiliency training, supported employment and education and  family education. We aim to implement NAVIGATE in geographically diverse EPI  programmes in Ontario, Canada, evaluating implementation and its effect on fidelity  to the EPI model, as well as individual-level outcomes (patient/family  member-reported and interviewer-rated), system-level outcomes (captured in  provincial administrative databases) and engagement of participants with lived  experience. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multisite, non-randomised pragmatic  hybrid effectiveness-implementation type III mixed methods study coordinated at the  Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto. Implementation is  supported by the Provincial System Support Program, a CAMH-based programme with  provincial offices across Ontario, and Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes  Ontario Mental Health at CAMH and the University of Toronto. The primary outcome is  fidelity to the EPI model as measured using the First Episode Psychosis  Services-Fidelity Scale. Four hundred participants in the EPI programmes will be  recruited and followed using both individual-level assessments and health  administrative data for 2 years following NAVIGATE initiation. People with lived  experience will be engaged in all aspects of the project, including through youth  and family advisory committees. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics board  approval has been obtained from CAMH and institutions overseeing the local EPI  programmes. Study findings will be reported in scientific journal articles and  shared with key stakeholders including youth, family members, programme staff and  policymakers.

Materials & methods: Approaches to adjusting for reference-arm effects are  presented within a causal inference framework. Bayesian and Frequentist approaches  are applied to three real data examples. Results: Reference-arm adjustment can  significantly impact estimated treatment differences, improve model fit and align  indirectly estimated treatment effects with those observed in randomized trials.  Reference-arm adjustment can possibly reverse the direction of estimated treatment  effects.

Although  there have been many studies on statistical methods for IPD-NMAs, it is unclear  whether there are statistical defects in published IPD-NMAs and whether the  reporting of statistical analyses has improved. This study aimed to investigate  statistical methods used and assess the reporting and methodological quality of  IPD-NMAs. METHODS: We searched four bibliographic databases to identify published  IPD-NMAs. The methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2 and reporting  quality assessed based on PRISMA-IPD and PRISMA-NMA. We performed stratified  analyses and correlation analyses to explore the factors that might affect quality.  RESULTS: We identified 21 IPD-NMAs. Only 23.8% of the included IPD-NMAs reported  statistical techniques used for missing participant data, 42.9% assessed the  consistency, and none assessed the transitivity. None of the included IPD-NMAs  reported sources of funding for trials included, only 9.5% stated pre-registration  of protocols, and 28.6% assessed the risk of bias in individual studies. For  reporting quality, compliance rates were lower than 50.0% for more than half of the  items. Less than 15.0% of the IPD-NMAs reported data integrity, presented the  network geometry, or clarified risk of bias across studies. IPD-NMAs with  statistical or epidemiological authors often better assessed the inconsistency  (P = 0.017). IPD-NMAs with a priori protocol were associated with higher reporting  quality in terms of search (P = 0.046), data collection process (P = 0.031), and  syntheses of results (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The reporting of statistical methods  and compliance rates of methodological and reporting items of IPD-NMAs were  suboptimal. Authors of future IPD-NMAs should address the identified flaws and  strictly adhere to methodological and reporting guidelines.",NA,"Gao, Ya Shi, Shuzhen Li, Muyang Luo, Xinyue Liu, Ming Yang, Kelu Zhang, Junhua Song, Fujian Tian, Jinhui",Gao Y Shi S Li M Luo X Liu M Yang K Zhang J Song F Tian J,NA,"Evidence-Based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou  University, No.199, Donggang West Road, Lanzhou City, 730000, Gansu Province, China.

While this mostly applies to population averaged results from analyses based on the  all available data, it is also possible to conduct so-called personalized analyses  based on a data subset whose observations resemble a particular patient for whom a  decision is to be made. Claims data from statutory health insurance companies could  provide necessary information for such personalized analyses. To derive treatment  recommendations from them for a particular patient in everyday care, an automated,  reproducible and efficiently programmed workflow would be required. We introduce the  R-package SimBaCo (Similarity-Based Cohort generation) offering a simple, but  modular, and intuitive framework for this task. With the six built-in R-functions,  this framework allows the user to create similarity cohorts tailored to the  characteristics of particular patients. An exemplary workflow illustrates the  distinct steps beginning with an initial cohort selection according to inclusion and  exclusion criteria. A plotting function facilitates investigating a particular  patient's characteristics relative to their distribution in a reference cohort, for  example the initial cohort or the precision cohort after the data has been trimmed  in accordance with chosen variables for similarity finding. Such precision cohorts  allow any form of personalized analysis, for example personalized analyses of  comparative effectiveness or customized prediction models developed from precision  cohorts. In our exemplary workflow, we provide such a treatment comparison whereupon  a treatment decision for a particular patient could be made. This is only one field  of application where personalized results can directly support the process of  clinical reasoning by leveraging information from individual patient data. With this  modular package at hand, personalized studies can efficiently weight benefits and  risks of treatment options of particular patients.",NA,"Wirbka, Lucas Haefeli, Walter E Meid, Andreas D",Wirbka L Haefeli WE Meid AD,ORCID: 0000-0003-3537-3205,"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacoepidemiology, Heidelberg University  Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.

METHODS: Placebo-controlled randomized AD clinical trials were systemically  searched in public databases. Longitudinal placebo response (mean change from  baseline in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale  [ADAS-cog]) and the corresponding demographic information were extracted to  establish a disease progression model. Covariate screening and subgroup analyses  were performed to identify potential factors affecting the disease progression rate.  RESULTS: A total of 134 publications (140 trials) were included in this model-based  meta-analysis. The typical disease progression rate was 5.82 points per year. The  baseline ADAS-cog score was included in the final model using an inverse U-type  function. Age was found to be negatively correlated with disease progression rate.  After correcting the baseline ADAS-cog score and the age effect, no significant  difference in the disease progression rate was found between trials published before  and after 2008 and between trials using an add-on design and those that did not use  an add-on design. However, a significant difference was found among different trial  regions. Trials in East Asian countries showed the slowest decline rate and the  largest placebo effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our model successfully quantified AD disease  progression by integrating baseline ADAS-cog score and age as important predictors.  These factors and geographic location should be considered when optimizing future  trial designs and conducting indirect comparisons of clinical outcomes.",NA,"Zhang, Ningyuan Zheng, Xijun Liu, Hongxia Zheng, Qingshan Li, Lujin",Zhang N Zheng X Liu H Zheng Q Li L,NA,"Center for Drug Clinical Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese  Medicine, No. 1200 Cailun Road, Shanghai, 201203, China.

A  total of 1,046 AC patients with hospitalization had been screened, and those with  regular follow-up for three years or otherwise until the date of malignancy  diagnosis without meeting exclusion criteria were enrolled; finally, 23 AC patients  with propranolol and 46 AC patients without propranolol were analyzed after twofold  propensity-score matching. The cumulative incidence of HCC was lower in the  propranolol group (log-rank test, P = 0.046). Furthermore, we undertook the  meta-analysis of annual incidence of HCC in AC patients, and 1,949 publications were  screened, within which eight studies were analyzed; the pooled annual incidence was  2.41%, which was higher than the calculated annual incidence of HCC in our AC cohort  with propranolol (1.45%). In conclusion, propranolol is associated with decreased  risk of HCC incidence in patients with AC.",Copyright © 2020 Tzu-Hao Li et al.,"Li, Tzu-Hao Tsai, Yu-Lien Hsu, Chien-Fu Liu, Chih-Wei Huang, Chia-Chang Yang, Ying-Ying Tsai, Hung-Cheng Huang, Shiang-Fen Hsieh, Yun-Cheng Liu, Hsuan-Miao Lee, Tzung-Yan Hou, Ming-Chih Tsai, Chang-Youh Lin, Han-Chieh",Li TH Tsai YL Hsu CF Liu CW Huang CC Yang YY Tsai HC Huang SF Hsieh YC Liu HM Lee TY Hou MC Tsai CY Lin HC,ORCID: 0000-0002-5510-0282 ORCID: 0000-0003-2919-9853 ORCID: 0000-0003-3034-2637,"Division of Allergy, Immunology, And Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine,  Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, No. 95, Wen Chang Rd., Shihlin District,  Taipei 111, Taiwan.

OBJECTIVES: Conduct a  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of the efficacy and safety of  second-line cabozantinib and regorafenib in patients with advanced HCC and disease  progression after prior sorafenib. METHODS: The CELESTIAL and RESORCE trials were  used for indirect comparison of second-line cabozantinib and regorafenib in advanced  HCC. Population-level data were available for RESORCE, individual patient data (IPD)  for CELESTIAL. To align with RESORCE, the CELESTIAL population was limited to  patients who received first-line sorafenib only. To minimize potential  effect-modifying population differences, the CELESTIAL IPD were weighted to balance  the distribution of clinically relevant baseline characteristics with those of  RESORCE. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated  for the matching-adjusted second-line CELESTIAL population and compared with those  for RESORCE using weighted Kaplan-Meier curves and parametric modeling. Rates of  grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) affecting > 5% of patients in  any study arm were compared. RESULTS: In the matching-adjusted second-line  populations (CELESTIAL, effective sample size = 266; RESORCE, n = 573), median (95%  confidence interval) OS was similar for cabozantinib and regorafenib (11.4  [8.9-17.0] versus 10.6 [9.1-12.1] months; p = 0.3474, log-rank test). Median PFS was  longer for cabozantinib than regorafenib (5.6 [4.9-7.3] versus 3.1 [2.8-4.2] months;  p = 0.0005, log-rank test). There was a trend for lower rates of some grade 3/4  TEAEs with regorafenib than with cabozantinib, which may reflect the exclusion of  sorafenib-intolerant patients from RESORCE but not from CELESTIAL, a difference that  the MAIC methods could not remove. Only diarrhea rates were statistically  significantly lower for regorafenib (p  ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib may  achieve similar OS and prolonged PFS compared with regorafenib in patients with  progressive advanced HCC after prior sorafenib.",NA,"Kelley, Robin K Mollon, Patrick Blanc, Jean-Frédéric Daniele, Bruno Yau, Thomas Cheng, Ann-Lii Valcheva, Velichka Marteau, Florence Guerra, Ines Abou-Alfa, Ghassan K",Kelley RK Mollon P Blanc JF Daniele B Yau T Cheng AL Valcheva V Marteau F Guerra I Abou-Alfa GK,ORCID: 0000-0002-1984-2430 ORCID: 0000-0001-6172-9485 ORCID: 0000-0002-5221-9755 ORCID: 0000-0002-9152-6512 ORCID: 0000-0002-3476-0046 ORCID: 0000-0002-1522-8054,"UCSF, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.  katie.kelley@ucsf.edu.

Cabozantinib, regorafenib and sorafenib are  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), meaning that they slow cancer progression by  targeting specific ways that tumors grow. Cabozantinib and regorafenib offer  benefits to patients compared with placebo (i.e., no treatment) for those who have  progressed despite sorafenib treatment. No clinical studies have compared  cabozantinib and regorafenib directly. This study compared the efficacy and safety  of cabozantinib and regorafenib using data from trials of each drug versus placebo:  CELESTIAL for cabozantinib and RESORCE for regorafenib. These two trials were  similar—both involved patients with progressive advanced HCC who had received  previous cancer treatment. There were some important differences, but these were  minimized using statistical methods (matching and adjustments/“weighting”) allowing  outcomes to be meaningfully compared. One difference that could not be removed by  the statistical methods was that patients who were intolerant to prior sorafenib  were excluded from RESORCE but were eligible for the CELESTIAL trial. In the  otherwise matched populations, treatment with cabozantinib was associated with  similar overall survival and significantly longer progression-free survival than  regorafenib. Rates of diarrhea were significantly lower for regorafenib than  cabozantinib, suggesting that regorafenib may be better tolerated, but this may  reflect the exclusion of sorafenib-intolerant patients from RESORCE.

Using longer follow-up and  individual patient-data from KEYNOTE-045, this study evaluates the  cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy or atezolizumab from a US payer  perspective.Materials and methods: A partitioned-survival model was developed over a  20-year time horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for pembrolizumab and  chemotherapy were extrapolated using a piecewise modelling approach, where  patient-level data from KEYNOTE-045 were used for the initial period followed by  parametric distributions. OS of atezolizumab was estimated by indirect treatment  comparisons based on KEYNOTE-045 and IMvigor211. Different scenarios were explored  in the absence of indirect comparisons on PFS and time-on-treatment (ToT) between  pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. Drug acquisition/administration, disease management,  adverse events, and terminal care costs were considered.Results: Compared with  chemotherapy, pembrolizumab resulted in a mean gain of 1.33 life-years and 1.14  quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and an incremental cost of $106,299, yielding an  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $93,481/QALY gained. Pembrolizumab dominated  atezolizumab in extending patients' life by 0.89 years and 0.76 QALYs, while  reducing costs by $26,458. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness included survival  extrapolation, OS hazard ratio of pembrolizumab vs. atezolizumab, and time horizon.  Pembrolizumab had a 66% and 100% probability of being cost-effective vs.  chemotherapy and atezolizumab, respectively, at a $100,000 willingness-to-pay  threshold.Limitations and conclusions: Uncertainties remain with extrapolated PFS  and OS for pembrolizumab, OS indirect comparison, and ToT for atezolizumab. Despite  these limitations, the model used robust methods to estimate key clinical endpoints  with patient-level data from longer follow-up of KEYNOTE-045. Pembrolizumab  dominates atezolizumab and is very likely cost-effective vs. chemotherapy in 2 L mUC  at a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.",NA,"Slater, Rachael Louise Lai, Yizhen Zhong, Yichen Li, Haojie Meng, Yang Moreno, Blanca Homet Godwin, James Luke Frenkl, Tara Sonpavde, Guru P Mamtani, Ronac",Slater RL Lai Y Zhong Y Li H Meng Y Moreno BH Godwin JL Frenkl T Sonpavde GP Mamtani R,ORCID: 0000-0002-8319-0609 ORCID: 0000-0003-1866-537X,"BresMed Health Solutions Ltd, Sheffield, UK.

Standard indirect comparisons use only aggregate data, under the assumption that  there are no differences in effect-modifying variables between the trial  populations. Population-adjusted indirect comparisons aim to relax this assumption  by using individual patient data (IPD) from one trial to adjust for differences in  effect modifiers between populations. At present, the most commonly used approach is  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), where weights are estimated that match  the covariate distributions of the reweighted IPD to the aggregate trial. MAIC was  originally proposed using the method of moments to estimate the weights, but more  recently entropy balancing has been proposed as an alternative. Entropy balancing  has an additional ""optimality"" property ensuring that the weights are as uniform as  possible, reducing the standard error of the estimates. In this brief method note,  we show that MAIC weights are mathematically identical whether estimated using  entropy balancing or the method of moments. Importantly, this means that the  standard MAIC (based on the method of moments) also enjoys the ""optimality""  property. Moreover, the additional flexibility of entropy balancing suggests several  interesting avenues for further research, such as combining population adjustment  via MAIC with adjustments for treatment switching or nonparametric covariate  adjustment.",© 2020 The Authors.

The main objective of this study was to compare the relative  efficacy of brodalumab, ixekizumab and secukinumab (three anti-interleukin-17 drugs)  through adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs). METHODS: A search was  carried out in June 2019, consulting these databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of  Science and the Cochrane Library. Studies including patients with moderate to severe  psoriasis randomized to receive treatment with anti-interleukin-17 drugs or  ustekinumab and with outcomes such as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75,  PASI 90 and PASI 100 scores or static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA), were  included. ITCs were carried out using the method proposed by Bucher et al RESULTS  AND DISCUSSION: Five randomized clinical trials were included. Analysing short-term  data, there were no statistically significant differences between any pair of drugs  in terms of PASI 75, PASI 100 or sPGA/sIGA 0/1. Analysing long-term data,  statistically significant differences were only observed for secukinumab versus  brodalumab in terms of PASI 100 (Absolute risk reduction -12.9%; 95% confidence  interval -22.7% to -3.1%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The ITCs indicated no  efficacy differences between anti-interleukin-17 drugs, except for secukinumab  versus brodalumab 52-week analysis in terms of achieving PASI 100. All three drugs  appear to act as equivalent clinical treatments for psoriasis.

Patients were often managed through routine  surveillance. The phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) CheckMate 238 (238)  demonstrated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab as an adjuvant treatment for  melanoma in patients with stage IIIB/C or IV disease (American Joint Committee on  Cancer [AJCC], 7th edition) versus ipilimumab. The study objective was to estimate  the relative efficacy, safety and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between  nivolumab and routine surveillance. METHODS: Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs)  of nivolumab versus placebo were constructed using data from 238 and EORTC 18071.  EORTC 18071 is a phase III RCT comparing ipilimumab with placebo in patients with  resected stage IIIA-IIIC melanoma (AJCC, 6th edition). ITCs were performed using the  Bucher comparison method and patient-level data for efficacy, safety and HRQoL.  RESULTS: For the efficacy outcomes, nivolumab performed significantly better than  placebo for recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53 [95% confidence  interval {CI}: 0.41, 0.68]) and distant metastases-free survival (HR: 0.59 [95% CI:  0.44, 0.78]). Safety ITCs indicated that patients receiving nivolumab had a greater  hazard of experiencing an adverse event (AE) and AEs leading to treatment  discontinuation, whereas there was a non-significant increased hazard of  experiencing a serious AE. HRQoL ITCs showed comparable time to deterioration in 14  of the 15 QLQ-C30 domains; only the dyspnoea domain significantly favoured placebo.  CONCLUSION: Nivolumab was associated with significantly improved efficacy outcomes  versus placebo, whereas maintaining patient's overall HRQoL. Across the different  analysis and populations, there was a high level of consistency in the effect size.",Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

METHODS: Data were from Phase  III trials on patients receiving monotherapy baricitinib, tocilizumab, adalimumab,  tofacitinib or MTX. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (0-100 mm) and  physical function using the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index  (HAQ-DI). An MAIC based on treatment-arm matching, an MAIC with study-level matching  and Bucher's method without matching compared change in outcomes between therapies.  Matching variables included age, gender, baseline disease activity and baseline  value of outcome measure. RESULTS: With all methods, greater improvements were  observed in pain and HAQ-DI at 6 months for baricitinib compared with adalimumab and  tocilizumab (p<0.05). Differences in treatment effects (TEs) favouring baricitinib  for pain VAS for treatment-arm matching, study-level matching and Bucher's method,  respectively, were -12, -12 and -12 for baricitinib versus adalimumab and -7, -7 and  -9 for baricitinib versus tocilizumab; the difference in TEs for HAQ-DI was -0.28,  -0.28 and -0.30 for adalimumab and -0.23, -0.23 and -0.26 for tocilizumab. For  baricitinib versus tofacitinib, no statistically significant differences for pain  improvement were observed except with one of the three methods (Bucher method) and  none for HAQ-DI. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest greater pain reduction and improved  physical function for baricitinib monotherapy compared with tocilizumab and  adalimumab monotherapy.

METHODS: Propensity  score (PS) methods were used to compare the efficacy of GOL IV 2 mg/kg and IFX  5 mg/kg using individual patient data (IPD) from the active arms of the phase 3  GO-ALIVE and ASSERT studies. Outcomes included the proportion of patients with a  ≥ 20% improvement in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society  Criteria (ASAS20), change from baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional  Index (BASFI) score, and change from baseline in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels  from weeks 4-52. RESULTS: Before matching, 105 patients were treated with GOL IV and  201 patients were treated with IFX. After matching on all covariates, 118 patients  were included in the ASAS20 analysis, 96 in the BASFI analysis, and 160 in the CRP  analysis. After matching, GOL IV showed significantly greater improvement in ASAS20  response than IFX for weeks 28-44 (e.g., OR = 9.05 [95% CI 1.62-50.4] at week 44)  and was comparable in change from baseline in BASFI scores and CRP levels to IFX at  all time points. Results were robust for inclusion of different sets of covariates  in scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis of its kind to  leverage clinical trial data to compare two biologics using PS methods in the  treatment of active AS. Overall, GOL IV was associated with greater improvement in  ASAS20 response than IFX in patients with AS at 28, 36, and 44 weeks of follow-up.  Key Points • Although intravenous golimumab (GOL IV) and infliximab (IFX) are the  only two IV-based tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors with demonstrated phase 3  clinical efficacy in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), no study has  evaluated their comparative efficacy in a head-to-head trial. • Propensity score  matching was used to derive indirect treatment comparisons of GOL IV and IFX for  ≥ 20% in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society Criteria  (ASAS20), change in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and change  in C-reactive protein (CRP) using individual patient data from the GO-ALIVE and  ASSERT phase 3 trials. • Propensity score matched indirect comparisons showed  improved relative efficacy of GOL IV compared to IFX; after matching for up to 16  baseline covariates, GOL IV was associated with significantly greater odds of ASAS20  response at weeks 28, 36, and 44 than IFX as well as equivalent changes from  baseline in BASFI and CRP. • This novel application of propensity score matching  using data from phase 3 trials, the first analysis of its kind in AS, allowed  adjustment for important imbalances in prognostic factors between trials to generate  estimates of comparative efficacy between GOL IV and IFX in the absence of a  head-to-head trial between these treatments.",NA,"Gensler, L S Chakravarty, S D Cameron, Chris Peterson, S Spin, P Kafka, S Nair, S Deodhar, A",Gensler LS Chakravarty SD Cameron C Peterson S Spin P Kafka S Nair S Deodhar A,NA,"Department of Medicine/Rheumatology, University of California, San Francisco, 400  Parnassus Ave, Box 0326, San Francisco, CA, 94143-0326, USA.

Two  approaches are frequently used in RRMM: network meta-analysis (NMA) and unanchored  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). The objective of the current study was  to evaluate the relevance and credibility of published NMA and unanchored MAIC  studies aiming to estimate the comparative efficacy of treatment options for RRMM.  METHODS: Twelve relevant studies were identified in the published literature (n = 7)  and from health technology assessment agencies (n = 5). Data from trials were  extracted to identify between-trial differences that may have biased results.  Credibility of the performed analyses and relevance of the research questions were  critically appraised using the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and  Outcomes Research (ISPOR) checklist and feedback based on consultations with  clinical experts. RESULTS: The identified studies concerned NMAs of randomized  controlled trials (RCTs; n = 7), unanchored MAICs (n = 4), or both types of analyses  (n = 1). According to clinical expert consultation, the majority of the identified  NMAs did not consider differences in prior therapies or treatment duration across  the RCTs included in the analyses, thereby compromising the relevance. CONCLUSION:  Based on the results and feedback from clinicians, the majority of NMAs did not  consider prior treatment history or treatment duration, which resulted in  nonrelevant comparisons. Furthermore, it may have compromised the credibility of the  estimates owing to differences in effect-modifiers between the different trials.  Pairwise comparisons by means of unanchored MAICs require clear justification given  the reliance on non-randomized comparisons.",Copyright © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes  Research.

Existing studies could not meet the physician's need to select the most beneficial  drugs for patients. 2) Principal component analysis is mainly used for scale  analysis and has not been reported in clinical field. 3) When the results of the  indirect meta-analysis were not satisfactory, no new solutions have been proposed in  existing meta-analysis studies. METHODS: The overall process of this study is  divided into 4 steps 1) literature search and data extraction; 2) principal  component analysis; 3) common reference-based indirect comparison meta-analysis; 4)  formal adjusted indirect comparison. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) experiments and eight long-term experiments were selected. The main  influencing factors are mortality, 6-min walk distance (6MW), mean pulmonary  arterial pressure (PAP), cardiac index (CI) by principal component analysis. There  was no significant heterogeneity among the indirect meta-analysis of three drugs.  But in the formal adjusted indirect comparison 1) the level of PAP of sildenafil  group (60.5 ± 22.35, 220) was higher than that of the other three groups, placebo  (53.5 ± 17.63, 507) (p < 0.001), ambrisentan (49.5 ± 15.08, 130) (p < 0.001), and  bosentan (54.6 ± 118.41, 311) (p < 0.001); 2) the level of CI of sildenafil group  (54 ± 18, 311) was higher than that of the other three groups, placebo (2.7 ± 1.09,  518) (p < 0.001), ambrisentan (2.5 ± 0.75, 130) (p < 0.001), and bosentan (2.5 ±  1.06, 333) (p < 0.001). In addition, sildenafil significantly improved the survival  rate comparing with ambrisentan and bosentan. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study  suggest that sildenafil might be more suitable for long-term treatment of PAH  patients than ambrisentan and bosentan. In order to enable clinicians to draw  conclusions more quickly and directly in the data-rich literature, we suggest the  use of principal component analysis combined with formal adjusted indirect  comparison to compare the efficacy and safety of drugs.",Copyright © 2020 Li and Li.,"Li, Xinmei Li, Te",Li X Li T,NA,"Department of Pharmacy, Fuwai Yunnan Cardiovascular Hospital, Kunming, China.

OBJECTIVE: To compare speed of  onset and level of skin improvement between the interleukin (IL)-17A antagonist  ixekizumab and the IL-23 p19 inhibitors guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab  in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Using data from  controlled clinical trials, both adjusted indirect comparisons (AICs) and matching  adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) were performed to determine the risk  difference (RD) between ixekizumab and each IL-23 p19 inhibitor for the proportion  of patients with ≥75%/90%/100% improvement compared with baseline in Psoriasis Area  and Severity Index (PASI 75/90/100) up to week 12. Placebo, etanercept, or  ustekinumab were used as the comparator bridge. RESULTS: In all (M)AICs, RDs  generally significantly favored ixekizumab over guselkumab (placebo bridge),  tildrakizumab (placebo or etanercept bridge), and risankizumab (placebo or  ustekinumab bridge) from the earliest assessment time (≥ week 2) to week 12 when  considering PASI 75/90/100 responses. CONCLUSION: Ixekizumab provides a faster onset  of effect and earlier clinical benefits than guselkumab, tildrakizumab, or  risankizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, as reflected by higher  levels of skin improvement than with these IL-23 p19 inhibitors up to week 12.",NA,"Gottlieb, Alice B Saure, Daniel Wilhelm, Stefan Dossenbach, Martin Schuster, Christopher Smith, Saxon D Ramot, Yuval Thaçi, Diamant",Gottlieb AB Saure D Wilhelm S Dossenbach M Schuster C Smith SD Ramot Y Thaçi D,ORCID: 0000-0003-0995-4372 ORCID: 0000-0002-8606-8385,"Department of Dermatology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY,  USA.

We conducted an indirect treatment comparison (ITC)  between brigatinib and alectinib, with crizotinib as a common comparator, using a  Bayesian model with non-informative prior distribution and assessed the  between-study heterogeneity of the studies. The primary efficacy endpoint was  progression-free survival (PFS), and efficacy was ranked using the surface under the  cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve values. ITC analysis showed that there were no  significant differences in PFS between the brigatinib and alectinib arms. However,  the SUCRA values revealed that alectinib ranked the highest by efficacy in the  overall patient population, whereas brigatinib ranked the highest by efficacy in the  CNS metastasis sub-group. Although there were no significant differences in the  incidence of G3-5 adverse events between the brigatinib and alectinib arms in the  overall patient population, the data were deemed insufficient for the CNS metastasis  sub-group analysis.

The phase III VISTA  trial established the bortezomib dosing schedule for VMP. To mitigate  bortezomib-associated toxicity, the phase III ALCYONE study of daratumumab plus VMP  (D-VMP) versus VMP used modified bortezomib dosing. D-VMP demonstrated improved  progression-free survival and overall response rate. Propensity score matching  enables indirect comparisons by controlling for differences in baseline covariates.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: The efficacy and safety of both arms of ALCYONE were compared  with VISTA VMP using propensity score matching. ALCYONE D-VMP and VMP patients were  matched on selected baseline characteristics to VISTA VMP patients, reducing or  eliminating systematic differences between treatment groups. RESULTS: After  matching, median progression-free survival and overall response rate were comparable  for ALCYONE VMP and VISTA VMP, and were significantly improved with ALCYONE D-VMP  versus VISTA VMP. Rates of grade 3/4 peripheral sensory neuropathy were  significantly lower for both arms of ALCYONE versus VISTA VMP, with or without  matching. CONCLUSION: This propensity score matching analysis demonstrates  significant improvements in efficacy with ALCYONE D-VMP versus VISTA VMP and a  significantly lower incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy in both arms of  ALCYONE versus VISTA VMP, although safety improvements may be due to different  bortezomib administration routes (ALCYONE, subcutaneous; VISTA, intravenous).",Copyright © 2020.

However, there is no consensus on  optimal IAP levels to improve surgical outcomes. Therefore, we conducted a  systematic literature review (SLR) to examine outcomes of low, standard, and high  IAP among adults undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: An electronic  database search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that  compared outcomes of low, standard, and high IAP among adults undergoing  laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to  conduct pairwise meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons of the levels of  IAP assessed across trials. RESULTS: The SLR and NMA included 22 studies. Compared  with standard IAP, on a scale of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain),  low IAP was associated with significantly lower overall pain scores at 24 h (mean  difference [MD]: - 0.70; 95% credible interval [CrI]: - 1.26, - 0.13) and reduced  risk of shoulder pain 24 h (odds ratio [OR] 0.24; 95% CrI 0.12, 0.48) and 72 h  post-surgery (OR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.07, 0.65). Hospital stay was shorter with low IAP  (MD: - 0.14 days; 95% CrI - 0.30, - 0.01). High IAP was not associated with a  significant difference for these outcomes when compared with standard or low IAP. No  significant differences were found between the IAP levels regarding need for  conversion to open surgery; post-operative acute bleeding, pain at 72 h, nausea, and  vomiting; and duration of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of published trials  indicates that using low, as opposed to standard, IAP during laparoscopic  cholecystectomy may reduce patients' post-operative pain, including shoulder pain,  and length of hospital stay. Heterogeneity in the pooled estimates and high risk of  bias of the included trials suggest the need for high-quality, adequately powered  RCTs to confirm these findings.",NA,"Raval, Amit D Deshpande, Sohan Koufopoulou, Maria Rabar, Silvia Neupane, Binod Iheanacho, Ike Bash, Lori D Horrow, Jay Fuchs-Buder, Thomas",Raval AD Deshpande S Koufopoulou M Rabar S Neupane B Iheanacho I Bash LD Horrow J Fuchs-Buder T,NA,"Center for Observational and Real-World Evidence, Merck & Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ,  USA.

METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out in Medline, EMBASE, and  CENTRAL in October 2018. Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) and/or  individual patient data meta-regression was used to connect ALTAIR (assessing  IVT-AFL T&E) with other studies, adjusting for between-trial differences in baseline  visual acuity and age or baseline visual acuity, age, and polypoidal choroidal  vasculopathy (PCV) status. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the  robustness of the results, including direct MAIC between IVT-AFL T&E (ALTAIR) and  RBZ T&E (CANTREAT and TREX-AMD trials). RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) (ALTAIR, VIEW 1 and 2, CATT, CANTREAT, and TREX) were included in the  analysis. IVT-AFL T&E was assessed in one study, ALTAIR (n = 255), while RBZ T&E was  assessed in two trials (n = 327). At 2 years, the median difference (95% credibility  interval) between IVT-AFL T&E and RBZ T&E regarding the numbers of Early Treatment  Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters gained was not significant (M1: - 2.29  [- 8.10, 3.58]; M2: - 0.55 [- 6.34, 5.29]). IVT-AFL T&E was associated with  significantly fewer injections than RBZ-T&E (M1: - 6.12 [- 7.60, - 4.65]; M2: - 5.93  [- 7.42, - 4.45]). Results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main  scenarios. CONCLUSION: Patients with wAMD receiving an IVT-AFL T&E regimen achieved  and maintained improvement in visual acuity with fewer injections over 2 years  compared with RBZ T&E. IVT-AFL T&E may therefore serve as the optimal therapy for  wAMD, as it was associated with clinical efficacy and minimized treatment burden.",NA,"Ohji, Masahito Lanzetta, Paolo Korobelnik, Jean-Francois Wojciechowski, Piotr Taieb, Vanessa Deschaseaux, Celine Janer, Daniel Tuckmantel, Claudia",Ohji M Lanzetta P Korobelnik JF Wojciechowski P Taieb V Deschaseaux C Janer D Tuckmantel C,NA,"Department of Ophthalmology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.

To estimate the  effects of sacubitril/valsartan had it been tested against a placebo control, we  made indirect comparisons of the effects of sacubitril/valsartan with putative  placebos in HF across the full range of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).  METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed patient-level data from the PARADIGM-HF and  PARAGON-HF trials (n = 13 194) and the CHARM-Alternative and CHARM-Preserved trials  (n = 5050, candesartan vs. placebo). The rate ratio (RR) of sacubitril/valsartan vs.  putative placebo was estimated by the product of the RR for sacubitril/valsartan vs.  RASi and the RR for RASi vs. placebo. Total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular  death were analysed using the negative binomial method. Treatment effects were  estimated using cubic spline methods by ejection fraction as a continuous measure.  Across the range of LVEF, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with a RR 0.54 [95%  confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.65] for the recurrent primary endpoint compared with  putative placebo (P < 0.001). Treatment benefits of sacubitril/valsartan vs.  putative placebo varied non-linearly with LVEF with attenuation of effects observed  at LVEF above 60%. When analyzing data from PARADIGM-HF and CHARM-Alternative, the  estimated risk reduction of sacubitril/valsartan vs. putative placebo was 48% (95%  CI 35-58%); P < 0.001. When analyzing data from PARAGON-HF and CHARM-Preserved (with  LVEF ≥ 45%), the estimated risk reduction of sacubitril/valsartan vs. putative  placebo was 29% (95% CI 7-46%); P = 0.013. Across the full range of LVEF, consistent  effects were observed for time-to-first endpoints: first primary endpoint (RR 0.72,  95% CI 0.64-0.82), first HF hospitalization (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78),  cardiovascular death (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.89), and all-cause death (RR 0.83, 95%  CI 0.71-0.96); all P < 0.02. CONCLUSION: This putative placebo analysis reinforces  the treatment benefits of sacubitril/valsartan on risk of adverse cardiovascular  events across the full range of LVEF, with most pronounced effects observed at a  LVEF up to 60%.",© The Author(s) 2020.

These trials  included heterogeneous patient populations, which limits the use of standard network  meta-analysis (NMA) for indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of relative efficacy.  Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) aims to correct these cross-trial  differences. We compared siponimod to other disease modifying treatments (DMTs) in  SPMS using MAIC.Methods: Individual patient data (IPD) were available for siponimod  (EXPAND), while only published summary data were available for IFNβ-1a (Nordic  Study, SPECTRIMS, IMPACT), IFNβ-1b (North American Study, European Study) and  natalizumab (ASCEND). MAICs were conducted between siponimod and the other DMTs by  re-weighting patients in EXPAND based on logistic regression.Results: Siponimod was  determined to be statistically significantly more effective for the outcome of time  to 6 month confirmed disability progression (CDP) compared with 22 µg IFNβ-1a and  250 µg IFNβ-1b, and for the outcome of time to CDP-3 compared with 60 µg IFNβ-1a.  Siponimod was numerically but not statistically superior for CDP in all other  comparisons. For annualized relapse rate (ARR), with the exception of natalizumab,  siponimod was numerically but not statistically superior to all  comparators.Conclusions: EXPAND provides evidence of the efficacy of siponimod  compared with placebo, and these MAICs complement this by demonstrating improved  efficacy of siponimod relative to DMTs. Siponimod offers a significant therapeutic  advance that may slow disease progression compared to other DMTs in an EXPAND-like  population with secondary progressive disease.",NA,"Samjoo, Imtiaz A Worthington, Evelyn Haltner, Anja Cameron, Chris Nicholas, Richard Rouyrre, Nicolas Dahlke, Frank Adlard, Nicholas",Samjoo IA Worthington E Haltner A Cameron C Nicholas R Rouyrre N Dahlke F Adlard N,ORCID: 0000-0003-1415-8055 ORCID: 0000-0003-1659-2082 ORCID: 0000-0002-9829-7791 ORCID: 0000-0003-3613-760X ORCID: 0000-0003-3333-6291,"Eversana, Burlington, Ontario, Canada.

Therefore, it is essential to  assess between-trial heterogeneity to determine the suitability of synthesizing ITC  results. We provide an illustrative case study in multiple sclerosis (MS) where we  assess the feasibility of conducting ITCs between siponimod and interferon beta-1b  (IFN β-1b) and between siponimod and ocrelizumab.Methods: We assessed the  feasibility of conducting ITCs using standard unadjusted methods (e.g. Bucher or  network meta-analysis [NMA]) as well as matching-adjusted indirect comparisons  (MAICs) using individual patient data (IPD) from the siponimod (EXPAND) trial, based  on guidance from NICE. Time to confirmed disability progression (CDP) at 3 or  6 months was assessed.Results: Bucher ITCs and NMAs, which rely on summary-level  data, were not able to account for important cross-trial differences. Comparisons  between siponimod and IFN β-1b were feasible using MAIC; the HRs (95% CI) for CDP-6  and CDP-3 were 0.55 (0.33-0.91) and 0.82 (0.42-1.63), respectively. ITCs were not  feasible between siponimod and ocrelizumab because study designs and patient  populations were too dissimilar to conduct a reliable ITC.Conclusions: This study  highlights the importance of conducting a detailed feasibility assessment before  undertaking ITCs to illuminate when excessive between-trial heterogeneity would  cause biased results. MAIC was performed for siponimod and IFN β-1b in the absence  of a head-to-head trial and was considered a more valid approach than a traditional  ITC to examine comparative effectiveness.",NA,"Samjoo, Imtiaz A Worthington, Evelyn Haltner, Anja Cameron, Chris Nicholas, Richard Dahlke, Frank Adlard, Nicholas",Samjoo IA Worthington E Haltner A Cameron C Nicholas R Dahlke F Adlard N,ORCID: 0000-0003-1415-8055 ORCID: 0000-0003-1659-2082 ORCID: 0000-0002-9829-7791 ORCID: 0000-0003-3613-760X ORCID: 0000-0003-3333-6291,"EVERSANA, Burlington, Canada.

Two high-dose, rapid-administration intravenous iron formulations are  currently available in the UK: iron isomaltoside 1000/ferric derisomaltose (IIM) and  ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). An indirect treatment comparison (ITC) recently showed  that improvement from baseline hemoglobin was significantly larger with IIM than  FCM. The objective was to use the ITC findings to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of  IIM versus FCM from the UK healthcare payer perspective.Methods: A patient-level  simulation model was developed in R to evaluate the cost per patient experiencing  hematological response with IIM versus FCM. The model generated a simulated cohort  from parametric distributions of baseline hemoglobin and bodyweight. Changes in  hemoglobin were modeled based on data from the ITC, covaried with baseline  hemoglobin based on patient-level data from a randomized controlled trial.  Posological models of the iron formulations were developed based on the summaries of  product characteristics. UK-specific costs were based on healthcare resource  groups.Results: The proportion of patients experiencing hematological response was  9.0% higher with IIM relative to FCM (79.0% versus 70.0%), based on modeling of  clinically realistic, correlated distributions of baseline hemoglobin and change  from baseline hemoglobin. The mean number of infusions needed to administer the  required dose was 1.92 with FCM, versus 1.38 with IIM, resulting in costs of £637  and £457 per treated patient with FCM and IIM respectively, corresponding to  respective costs of £910 and £579 per responder.Conclusions: The analysis showed  that using IIM rather than FCM in patients with IDA was dominant and would reduce  the number of iron infusions required to correct iron deficiency, thereby reducing  the costs associated with IDA treatment and simultaneously increasing the proportion  of patients with IDA experiencing a clinically meaningful hematological response.",NA,"Pollock, Richard F Muduma, Gorden",Pollock RF Muduma G,ORCID: 0000-0002-9873-7507,"Covalence Research Ltd, London, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the  cost-effectiveness of BRX compared with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors (SSRIs) for PPD. METHODS: We projected costs (2018 U.S. dollars) and  health (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) for mothers treated with BRX or SSRIs  and their children. A health state transition model projected clinical and economic  outcomes for mothers based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, from a U.S.  payer perspective. The modeled population consisted of adult patients with moderate  to severe PPD, similar to BRX clinical trial patients. Short-term efficacy for BRX  and SSRIs came from an indirect treatment comparison. Long-term efficacy outcomes  over 4 weeks, 11 years (base case), and 18 years were based on results from an  18-year longitudinal study. Maternal health utility values came from analysis of  trial-based short-form 6D responses. Other inputs were derived from the literature.  RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for BRX versus SSRIs was $106,662  per QALY gained over an 11-year time horizon. Drug and administration costs for BRX  averaged $38,501, compared with $25 for SSRIs over the studied time horizon.  Maternal total direct medical costs averaged $65,908 in the BRX arm, compared with  $73,653 in the SSRI arm. BRX-treated women averaged 6.230 QALYs compared with 5.979  QALYs for the SSRI arm. Adding partner costs and utilities in a sensitivity analysis  further favored BRX. Results were sensitive to the severity of PPD at baseline and  the model time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that BRX was  cost-effective at the $150,000-per-QALY threshold with 58% probability. CONCLUSIONS:  Analysis using a state transition model showed BRX to be a cost-effective therapy  compared with SSRIs for treating women with PPD.

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Web of Science,  Embase and Cochrane Library through May 14, 2019. Randomized controlled trials on  elderly AML patients comparing the efficacy and safety between decitabine and  azacitidine, or comparing one of HMAs to standard supportive care or placebo were  selected. The major outcomes of interest were performed with methods of adjusted  indirect comparison and the fixed effect model. RESULTS: Only three RCTs including a  total number of 1086 patients were identified. Direct comparisons showed that  azacitidine significantly reduced mortality (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97) while  decitabine was not significantly associated with lower mortality (RR = 0.97, 95% CI  0.92-1.02) compared to the conventional care regimen (CCR). In addition, for the  indirect method, azacitidine significantly reduced mortality compared to decitabine  (RR = 0.83 95% CI 0.77-0.90) and was more likely to improve complete response (CR)  (RR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.17-2.35, low-certainty evidence). No statistical significance  was found for the other studied outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to CCR, decitabine  and azacitidine can promote studied outcomes in elderly AML patients. Indirect  evidence with low certainty was used to compare these two agents. The superiority of  either agent cannot be confirmed, and head-to-head clinical trials are still  required.",© The Author(s) 2020.,"Wen, Bingbing You, Weiwen Yang, Sitian Du, Xin",Wen B You W Yang S Du X,NA,"1Department of Internal Medicine, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First  Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518000 China.

METHODS:  Treatment effects, as measured by the 1-year reduction in intraocular pressure  (IOP), were estimated with an adjusted indirect treatment comparison. Evidence from  randomized clinical trials was identified for four different MIGS methods. A  disease-transition model was developed by capturing clinically relevant POAG stages  and the expected natural disease evolution. Outcomes of the disease-transition model  were the comparative utility [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)], cost and  cost-utility of included strategies in a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: Estimated 1-year  IOP reductions were: cataract surgery - 2.05 mmHg (95% CI - 3.38; - 0.72), one  trabecular micro-bypass stent - 3.15 mmHg (95% CI - 5.66; - 0.64), two trabecular  micro-bypass stents - 4.85 mmHg (95% CI - 7.71; - 1.99) and intracanalicular  scaffold - 2.25 mmHg (95% CI - 4.87; 0.37). Discounted outcomes from the  disease-transition model appraised the strategy of two trabecular micro-bypass  stents with cataract surgery in the moderate POAG stage as the one providing the  greatest added value, with 10,955€ per additional QALY. Improved outcomes were seen  when assessing MIGS in the moderate POAG stage. CONCLUSIONS: When indirectly  comparing alternative MIGS methods combined with cataract surgery, the option of two  trabecular micro-bypass stents showed both a superior efficacy and long-term  cost-utility from a German perspective. Moreover, outcomes of the disease-transition  model suggest POAG patients to beneficiate the most from an earlier intervention in  the moderate stage contrary to waiting until an advanced disease is present.",NA,"Bartelt-Hofer, Jose Flessa, Steffen",Bartelt-Hofer J Flessa S,ORCID: 0000-0002-2775-393X,"University of Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany. joselo.bartelt@gmail.com.

Changes in colonic microflora may play  an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and improvements in the  intestinal microflora may relieve the disease. Fecal bacterial transplants and oral  probiotics are becoming important ways to relieve active ulcerative colitis.  PURPOSE: This systematic review with meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety  of basic treatment combined with fecal microbiota transplantation or mixed  probiotics therapy in relieving mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The  PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane libraries (updated September 2019) were searched to  identify randomized, placebo-controlled, or head-to-head trials assessing fecal  microbiota transplantation or probiotic VSL#3 as induction therapy in active  ulcerative colitis. We analyze data using the R program to obtain evidence of direct  comparison and to generate intermediate variables for indirect treatment  comparisons. RESULTS: Seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were  used as the sources of the induction data. All treatments were superior to placebo.  In terms of clinical remission and clinical response to active ulcerative colitis,  direct comparisons showed fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 3.47, 95% CI =  1.93-6.25) (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.18-5.21) and mixed probiotics VSL#3 (OR = 2.40,  95% CI = 1.49-3.88) (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.53-6.25) to have better effects than the  placebo. Indirect comparison showed fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic  VSL#3 did not reach statistical significance either in clinical remission (RR =  1.20, 95% CI = 0.70-2.06) or clinical response (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.62-1.45). In  terms of safety, fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.51-2.61)  and VSL #3 (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.33-2.49) showed no statistically significant  increase in adverse events compared with the control group. In terms of serious  adverse events, there was no statistical difference between the fecal microbiota  transplantation group and the control group (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.46-3.57). The  probiotics VSL#3 seems more safer than fecal microbiota transplantation, because  serious adverse events were not reported in the VSL#3 articles. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal  microbiota transplantation or mixed probiotics VSL#3 achieved good results in  clinical remission and clinical response in active ulcerative colitis, and there was  no increased risk of adverse reactions. There was no statistical difference between  the therapeutic effect of fecal microbiota transplantation and that of mixed  probiotics VSL#3. However, the use of fecal microbiota transplantation and  probiotics still has many unresolved problems in clinical applications, and more  randomized controlled trials are required to confirm its efficacy.",NA,"Dang, Xiaofei Xu, Mingjie Liu, Duanrui Zhou, Dajie Yang, Weihua",Dang X Xu M Liu D Zhou D Yang W,ORCID: 0000-0002-7117-5508 ORCID: 0000-0001-5468-758X,"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Medical Research & Laboratory Diagnostic  Center, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong,  China.

A technique of ePIE with multiple axial intensity constraints, which is called  MAIC-PIE, is proposed to drastically improve the convergence speed and reduce the  calculation time. This technique requires that the diffracted light from the sample  is propagated to the multiple individual axial planes, which can be achieved by  using the beam splitter and multiple CCDs. In this technique, an additional  intensity constraint is involved in the iterative process that makes for building  the reasonable guesses of the probe and object in the first few iterations and  accelerating the convergence.

Researchers may use the adjusted  indirect comparison based on the Bucher method (AIC) or the matching-adjusted  indirect comparison (MAIC). While the Bucher method may provide biased results when  included trials differ in baseline characteristics that influence the treatment  outcome (treatment effect modifier), this issue may be addressed by applying the  MAIC method if individual patient data (IPD) for at least one part of the AIC is  available. Here, IPD is reweighted to match baseline characteristics and/or  treatment effect modifiers of published data. However, the MAIC method does not  provide a solution for situations when several common comparators are available. In  these situations, assuming that the indirect comparison via the different common  comparators is homogeneous, we propose merging these results by using meta-analysis  methodology to provide a single, potentially more precise, treatment effect  estimate. This paper introduces the method to combine several MAIC networks using  classic meta-analysis techniques, it discusses the advantages and limitations of  this approach, as well as demonstrates a practical application to combine several  (M)AIC networks using data from Phase III psoriasis randomized control trials (RCT).",© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"Saure, Daniel Schacht, Alexander Kadziola, Zbigniew Brnabic, Alan J M",Saure D Schacht A Kadziola Z Brnabic AJM,ORCID: 0000-0002-6961-9587,"Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Indiana.

Methodological  considerations and guidelines.,S0040-5957(19)30182-9 [pii] 10.1016/j.therap.2019.11.007 [doi],"Single-arm studies are sometimes used as pivotal studies but they have  methodological limitations which prevent them from obtaining the high level of  reliability as for a randomised controlled study which remains the gold standard in  the evaluation of new treatments. The objective of this roundtable was to discuss  the limitations of these single-arm studies, to analyse available and acceptable  solutions in order to propose guidelines for their conduct and assessment.  Single-arm studies themselves are intrinsically inappropriate for demonstrating the  benefit of a new treatment because it is impossible to infer the benefit from a  value obtained under treatment without knowing what it would have been in the  absence of the new treatment. The implication is that comparison with other data is  necessary. However this comparison has limitations due to (1) the post hoc choice of  the reference used for comparison, (2) the confusion bias for which an adjustment  approach is imperative and, (3) the other biases, measure and attrition among  others. When these limitations are taken into account this should, first and  foremost, lead to the conduct of externally controlled trials instead of single-arm  trials as is proposed by the latest version of ICH E10. Moreover, the external  control must be formalised in the study protocol with a priori selection of both the  reference control and the formal method of comparison: test in relation to a  standard, adjustment on individual data, a synthetic control group or  matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC). Lastly, externally controlled studies  must be restricted to situations where randomisation is infeasible. To be  acceptable, these studies must be able to guarantee freedom from residual confusion  bias, which is only truly acceptable if the observed effect is dramatic and the  usual course of the disease is highly predicable.",Copyright © 2019.

Very-late (>1-year) stent-related MACE have not been well described.  OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency and predictors of  very-late stent-related events or MACE by stent type. METHODS: Individual patient  data from 19 prospective, randomized metallic stent trials maintained at a leading  academic research organization were pooled. Very-late MACE (a composite of cardiac  death, myocardial infarction [MI], or ischemia-driven target lesion  revascularization [ID-TLR]), and target lesion failure (cardiac death, target-vessel  MI, or ID-TLR) were assessed within year 1 and between 1 and 5 years after PCI with  bare-metal stents (BMS), first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES1) and  second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES2). A network meta-analysis was performed  to evaluate direct and indirect comparisons. RESULTS: Among 25,032 total patients,  3,718, 7,934, and 13,380 were treated with BMS, DES1, and DES2, respectively. MACE  rates within 1 year after PCI were progressively lower after treatment with BMS  versus DES1 versus DES2 (17.9% vs. 8.2% vs. 5.1%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Between  years 1 and 5, very-late MACE occurred in 9.4% of patients (including 2.9% cardiac  death, 3.1% MI, and 5.1% ID-TLR). Very-late MACE occurred in 9.7%, 11.0%, and 8.3%  of patients treated with BMS, DES1, and DES2, respectively (p < 0.0001), linearly  increasing between 1 and 5 years. Similar findings were observed for target lesion  failure in 19,578 patients from 12 trials. Findings were confirmed in the network  meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale, individual patient data pooled  study, very-late stent-related events occurred between 1 and 5 years after PCI at a  rate of ∼2%/year with all stent types, with no plateau evident.

At  the same time, it is often accompanied by chronic physical disease, cognitive  impairment, and functional damage, which is one of the common diseases that  seriously threaten human health. At present, 3 kinds of oral Chinese patent medicine  have clinical comparability in the treatment of depression of liver stagnation and  spleen deficiency, but there is no evidence for clinical efficacy and safety.  Therefore, this study aims to integrate the clinical related syndromes of direct and  indirect comparison by using systematic evaluation and network meta-analysis (NMA).  According to the data, the different Chinese patent medicines with the same evidence  body for the treatment of the disease are collected, analyzed, and sequenced in a  quantitative and comprehensive way, and then the advantages and disadvantages of the  efficacy and safety between different Chinese patent medicines are screened out to  get the best choice scheme, thus providing reference value and evidence-based  theoretical evidence for the clinical optimization of drug selection. METHODS:  Comprehensive retrieval of China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese  scientific journal database (VIP), China biological feature database (CBM) and  WANFANG Data Chinese electronic database and the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of  Science, and EMBASE foreign database. Search and publish the clinical randomized  controlled trials of these 3 Chinese patent medicines combined with fluoxetine  compared with fluoxetine. The retrieval time is from the establishment of the  database to October 31, 2019. The 2 first authors will screen the literatures that  meet the inclusion criteria, extract the data independently according to the  predesigned rules, and evaluate the literature quality and bias risk of the included  research according to the Cochrane 5.1 manual standard. R and Aggregate Data Drug  Information System software were used for data consolidation and NMA to evaluate the  ranking probability of all interventions. RESULTS: This result will show that the  best oral Chinese patent medicine to assist the treatment of liver stagnation and  spleen deficiency depression provides reliable evidence. CONCLUSION: This study will  provide systematic evidence-based medicine evidence for TCM assisted treatment of  depression of liver stagnation and spleen deficiency type, and help clinicians,  patients with depression and decision-makers to make more effective, safer, and  economic optimal treatment plan in the decision-making process.

We conducted an indirect treatment comparison to estimate  differences in the efficacy and safety between dupilumab and benralizumab for  inadequately controlled asthma using the Bayesian approach. The primary efficacy  endpoint was annual exacerbation rate (AER). A subgroup analysis by blood eosinophil  count was also performed. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of any  adverse events (AAEs). The results demonstrate that there was no significant  difference in the AER between dupilumab and benralizumab in overall patients and the  subgroup with the blood eosinophil count of <150. However, the AER was significantly  lower in the dupilumab group than in the benralizumab group in the subgroup with a  blood eosinophil count of ≥150 but <300, and ≥300 with the rate ratio and 95%  credible interval of 0.51 (0.29-0.92) and 0.58 (0.39-0.84), respectively. There was  no significant difference in the AAEs between the dupilumab and benralizumab groups.  This indirect treatment comparison indicates that dupilumab is superior to  benralizumab in patients with inadequately controlled asthma having higher blood  eosinophil counts.

In the absence of head-to-head evidence, indirect  treatment comparisons such as network meta-analyses (NMAs) can be performed to  evaluate relative effects of treatments. This study aims to assess the feasibility  of conducting an NMA of available therapies for ATTR-PN patients.Methods: Pivotal  trials for three approved ATTR-PN treatments, tafamidis (Fx-005), patisiran (APOLLO)  and inotersen (NEURO-TTR), were compared in terms of study design, baseline  population characteristics, outcome definitions and baseline risk. These assessments  of heterogeneity informed the decision to perform Bayesian NMAs.Results: Despite  similar study designs, clear differences in eligibility criteria between trials were  accompanied by imbalances in baseline population characteristics considered to be  plausible effect modifiers, such as disease stage and previous treatment. Of the  outcomes assessed, only quality of life and adverse events were similarly reported  in all trials. Neuropathy outcomes were not evaluated consistently between  trials.Conclusions: An NMA of ATTR-PN treatments was not feasible, given the  observed cross-trial heterogeneity.

Recently, a topical lotion of  the combination of halobetasol 0.01% plus tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) was approved  for treating adult plaque psoriasis. Currently, no head-to-head studies have  compared Cal/BD foam with HP/TAZ lotion.Objective: Compare the effectiveness and  drug incremental cost per responder (ICPR) of Cal/BD foam vs. HP/TAZ lotion in  moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Methods: An anchor-based, matching-adjusted  indirect comparison was conducted for PGA treatment success (Physician's Global  Assessment of ""clear"" or ""almost clear,"" [PGA 0/1] with at least a 2-point  improvement) using individual patient data from 3 randomized clinical studies of  Cal/BD foam and published data from 2 randomized, Phase 3 clinical studies of HP/TAZ  lotion. The number needed to treat and ICPR were also calculated.Results: After  reweighting of patients in the Cal/BD foam studies to match summary baseline  characteristics of the HP/TAZ lotion study patients and anchoring to vehicle effect,  4 weeks of Cal/BD foam produced a significantly greater rate of treatment success  than 8 weeks of HP/TAZ lotion treatment (51.4 vs. 30.7%; treatment difference =  20.7%, p < .001). The number needed to treat with Cal/BD foam was also less than  HP/TAZ lotion (1.9 vs. 3.3). Using US wholesale acquisition costs and equal weekly  consumption rates, the incremental cost per PGA 0/1 responder relative to vehicle  for Cal/BD foam was $3,988 and was 37% lower compared with HP/TAZ lotion  ($6,294).Conclusions: The indirect comparison analyses showed that Cal/BD foam was  associated with a greater rate of treatment success, lower ICPR, and quicker  treatment response than HP/TAZ lotion in adult patients with moderate-to-severe  plaque psoriasis.",NA,"Wu, Jashin J Hansen, Jes B Patel, Dharm S Nyholm, Nanna Veverka, Karen A Swensen, Andrine R",Wu JJ Hansen JB Patel DS Nyholm N Veverka KA Swensen AR,NA,"Dermatology Research and Education Foundation, Irvine, CA, USA.

Thus, OCS dosage reduction is desirable. Relative  efficacy of biologics in reducing OCS treatment for severe, uncontrolled asthma is  not fully characterized. OBJECTIVE: We performed a matching-adjusted indirect  comparison (MAIC) to assess the relative effects on OCS treatment reduction of three  biologic asthma treatments. METHODS: In MAIC of benralizumab vs. mepolizumab and vs.  dupilumab, patient-level data from the Phase III benralizumab OCS-sparing trial,  ZONDA, were weighted to match treatment effect-modifying patient characteristics in  comparator trials. RESULTS: After matching adjustment, mean difference between  benralizumab and mepolizumab for OCS reduction was 6.08% (95% CI -22.22-34.38;  P = .67) by week 24, and odds ratio of OCS elimination was 2.32 (95% CI 0.48-11.15;  P = .29). A trend in annual asthma exacerbation rate reduction favouring  benralizumab over mepolizumab was observed, although it was not statistically  significant (rate ratio [RR] = 0.56 [95% CI 0.28-1.13; P = .11]). Mean difference  between benralizumab and dupilumab for OCS reduction was -0.71% (95% CI  -20.56-19.15; P = .94), and odds ratio of OCS elimination was 2.26 (95% CI  0.52-9.84; P = .28). A non-significant trend in annual asthma exacerbation rate  reduction favouring benralizumab over dupilumab was observed (RR = 0.50 [95% CI  0.20-1.28; P = .15]). Effective sample size was 49% (72 vs. 148) and 25% (36 vs.  142) of original sample size for MAIC of benralizumab vs. mepolizumab and  benralizumab vs. dupilumab, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:  Following patient baseline characteristics matching across clinical trials,  benralizumab demonstrated efficacy comparable to mepolizumab and dupilumab for OCS  dosage reduction, OCS elimination, and annual exacerbation rate reduction.  Comparatively low effective sample sizes indicated substantial differences for  patient populations between ZONDA and mepolizumab and dupilumab trials.",© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"Bourdin, Arnaud Husereau, Don Molinari, Nicolas Golam, Sarowar Siddiqui, Mohd Kashif Lindner, Leandro Xu, Xiao",Bourdin A Husereau D Molinari N Golam S Siddiqui MK Lindner L Xu X,ORCID: 0000-0002-4645-5209,"Department of Respiratory Diseases, Arnaud de Villeneuve Hospital, Montpellier  University Hospitals, Montpellier, France.

METHODS: Matching-adjusted  indirect comparisons of four-week PASI-75 responses of Cal/BD foam were performed  versus 12-week responses of methotrexate, acitretin, fumaric acid esters (FAE) and  16-week responses of apremilast. Analyses took a payer perspective and included  drug, physician visit and monitoring costs. RESULTS: In all countries, Cal/BD foam  generated the lowest cost per responder (CPR). Against methotrexate, apremilast and  acitretin, Cal/BD foam generated response for less than €190 in Italy, €195 in  Portugal, €216 in Greece, £218 in the United Kingdom, €250 in Belgium, €319 in  Spain, and €359 in the Netherlands. Relative to treatment with FAE, Cal/BD foam  resulted in response for less than €298, €430, €382 and £262 in Belgium, the  Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, respectively. For Cal/BD foam, apremilast  and FAE, total costs were driven by drug costs; for methotrexate and acitretin, by  monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Driven by its lower costs and high response rates, Cal/BD  foam is likely to be a cost-effective option over the short-term in the investigated  psoriasis population.",NA,"Balak, Deepak M W Carrascosa, Jose-Manuel Gregoriou, Stamatis Calzavara-Pinton, Piergiacomo Bewley, Anthony Antunes, Joana Nyeland, Martin E Viola, Marta G Sawyer, Laura M Becla, Lidia",Balak DMW Carrascosa JM Gregoriou S Calzavara-Pinton P Bewley A Antunes J Nyeland ME Viola MG Sawyer LM Becla L,ORCID: 0000-0003-4266-0771,"Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University Medical Centre Utrecht,  Utrecht, the Netherlands.

The  goal of this article was to assess the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus  rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in Chinese patients  with AF from the perspective of the Chinese health care system. METHODS: A Markov  model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus  rivaroxaban. Clinical events were modeled for a lifetime horizon, based on clinical  efficacy data from indirect treatment comparisons. The weighted average of the most  recent prices of these 2 drugs was used as the drug acquisition cost. Other costs,  including follow-up costs and event costs, were collected by using a survey from a  panel of local experts. Utility inputs (health state utilities, clinical event  disutilities, and event history utility) were obtained from published literature.  Sensitivity analyses that included scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity  analysis were conducted to examine the robustness of the economic model. FINDINGS:  Over a lifetime, patients treated with dabigatran experienced fewer ischemic strokes  (2.14 dabigatran vs 2.61 rivaroxaban) and fewer intracranial hemorrhage (0.48 vs  0.94) per 100 patient-years. In the base case analysis, dabigatran had an  incremental cost of ¥28,128 but with higher life years (10.38 vs 10.14) and  quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (7.95 vs 7.70). The resulting incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥112,910 per QALY gained and net monetary benefit of  ¥12,214 versus rivaroxaban showed that dabigatran was a cost-effective alternative  to rivaroxaban. Extensive sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were  robust over a wide range of inputs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated  that dabigatran was cost-effective in 84.2% of the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations  compared with rivaroxaban. IMPLICATIONS: Dabigatran reduced the occurrence of  clinical events and increased QALYs compared with rivaroxaban. The use of dabigatran  for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism is a cost-effective option  compared with rivaroxaban among patients with AF in China.",Copyright © 2019.

However, it can be  argued that NICE has developed a more prominent international profile than most in  their use of economics. After 20 years of operation, it is timely to assess the  extent of NICE's achievements, including the economic evaluation methods it has used  and its willingness to adapt these as new evaluative approaches emerge and when NICE  faces particular policy challenges. This paper considers some of the important  policy and contextual developments in the UK over the last 20 years and how these  may have shaped NICE's approach to economic evaluation. It then assesses key areas  of NICE methods, including perspective, defining benefits, modelling and  uncertainty. The paper concludes that NICE has provided important support for the  development of new methods, in particular through its role in identifying priorities  for methods research funding and its sponsorship of the NICE Decision Support Unit.  However, potentially important developments in methods in a number of important  areas have yet to be formally included in NICE's methods guidance and this should be  addressed in the Institute's 2019/2020 methods review.",NA,"Sculpher, Mark Palmer, Stephen",Sculpher M Palmer S,ORCID: 0000-0003-3746-9913,"Centre for Health Economics, University of York, York, YO10 5DD, UK.  mark.sculpher@york.ac.uk.

The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either  the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although  there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow  sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled  trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in  psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains  unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head,  which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. This is the baseline  update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2017, in preparation for this  Cochrane Review becoming a living systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To compare the  efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biologics  for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and to provide a ranking of these  treatments according to their efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: We updated our  research using the following databases to January 2019: the Cochrane Skin  Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),  MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and the conference proceedings of a number of dermatology  meetings. We also searched five trials registers and the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports (until June 2019).  We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further  references to relevant RCTs. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)  of systemic treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe  plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed  with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to  placebo or another active agent. The primary outcomes of this review were: the  proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at  least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 at induction phase (from 8 to 24  weeks after the randomisation), and the proportion of participants with serious  adverse effects (SAEs) at induction phase. We did not evaluate differences in  specific adverse effects. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Several groups of two review  authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias'  assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network  meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to  their effectiveness (as measured by the PASI 90 score) and acceptability (the  inverse of serious adverse effects). We assessed the certainty of the body of  evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes, according to GRADE, as either  very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear  or missing. MAIN RESULTS: We included 140 studies (31 new studies for the update) in  our review (51,749 randomised participants, 68% men, mainly recruited from  hospitals). The overall average age was 45 years; the overall mean PASI score at  baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo-controlled  (59%), 30% were head-to-head studies, and 11% were multi-armed studies with both an  active comparator and a placebo. We have assessed a total of 19 treatments. In all,  117 trials were multicentric (two to 231 centres). All but two of the outcomes  included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment from 8 to 24  weeks after randomisation). We assessed many studies (57/140) as being at high risk  of bias; 42 were at an unclear risk, and 41 at low risk. Most studies (107/140)  declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 22 studies did not report the  source of funding. Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the  interventions (conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biological  treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in terms of reaching PASI  90. At class level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17,  anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than  the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents. At drug level, in terms of  reaching PASI 90, infliximab, all of the anti-IL17 drugs (ixekizumab, secukinumab,  bimekizumab and brodalumab) and the anti-IL23 drugs (risankizumab and guselkumab,  but not tildrakizumab) were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than  ustekinumab and 3 anti-TNF alpha agents: adalimumab, certolizumab and etanercept.  Adalimumab and ustekinumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90  than certolizumab and etanercept. There was no significant difference between  tofacitinib or apremilast and between two conventional drugs: ciclosporin and  methotrexate. Network meta-analysis also showed that infliximab, ixekizumab,  risankizumab, bimekizumab, guselkumab, secukinumab and brodalumab outperformed other  drugs when compared to placebo in reaching PASI 90. The clinical effectiveness for  these seven drugs was similar: infliximab (versus placebo): risk ratio (RR) 29.52,  95% confidence interval (CI) 19.94 to 43.70, Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking  (SUCRA) = 88.5; moderate-certainty evidence; ixekizumab (versus placebo): RR 28.12,  95% CI 23.17 to 34.12, SUCRA = 88.3, moderate-certainty evidence; risankizumab  (versus placebo): RR 27.67, 95% CI 22.86 to 33.49, SUCRA = 87.5, high-certainty  evidence; bimekizumab (versus placebo): RR 58.64, 95% CI 3.72 to 923.86, SUCRA =  83.5, low-certainty evidence; guselkumab (versus placebo): RR 25.84, 95% CI 20.90 to  31.95; SUCRA = 81; moderate-certainty evidence; secukinumab (versus placebo): RR  23.97, 95% CI 20.03 to 28.70, SUCRA = 75.4; high-certainty evidence; and brodalumab  (versus placebo): RR 21.96, 95% CI 18.17 to 26.53, SUCRA = 68.7; moderate-certainty  evidence. Conservative interpretation is warranted for the results for bimekizumab  (as well as tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid  esters, and methotrexate), as these drugs, in the NMA, have been evaluated in few  trials. We found no significant difference between any of the interventions and the  placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAE analyses were based on a very  low number of events with low to very low certainty for just under half of the  treatment estimates in total, and moderate for the others. Thus, the results have to  be viewed with caution and we cannot be sure of the ranking. For other efficacy  outcomes (PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1) the results were very  similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on quality of life was often poorly  reported and was absent for several of the interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our  review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, ixekizumab,  risankizumab, bimekizumab, guselkumab, secukinumab and brodalumab were the best  choices for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis on the  basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence (low-certainty evidence for  bimekizumab). This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were  measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficient for  evaluation of longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low  numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 45  years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical  of patients seen in daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that  short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly-reported safety data and thus  do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments.  Indeed, we found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo  in terms of SAEs, but the evidence for all the interventions was of very low to  moderate quality. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the  treatments included in this review, it will also be necessary to evaluate  non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies.  In terms of future research, randomised trials comparing directly active agents are  necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established,  including head-to-head trials amongst and between conventional systemic and small  molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23  versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also  undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve  participants, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.).  Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and  researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the  interventions and the comparative safety of different agents. Editorial note: This  is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to  review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant  new evidence as it becomes available.

There is no direct evidence on the comparative  effectiveness of RF ablation with Ablation Index and cryoballoon (CB). The objective  of the present study was to conduct a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC)  using individual patient-level data (IPD) to compare the effectiveness of RF  ablation with Ablation Index to that of CB on recurrence of atrial arrhythmias  12 months after catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF). METHODS:  Individual patient-level data for RF ablation with Ablation Index were obtained from  two studies: Solimene et al. [J Interv Card Electrophysiol 54(1):9-15, 2019] and  Hussein et al. [J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 28(9):1037-1047, 2017]. Comparable CB  studies identified from a systematic literature review were pooled. Prognostic  variables for adjustment were ranked a priori by several practicing  electrophysiologists. In the absence of a common treatment arm between the Ablation  Index and CB studies, an unanchored MAIC was conducted. Primary analysis compared  the Solimene et al. study to pooled CB studies. A secondary analysis compared pooled  RF ablation with Ablation Index studies to pooled CB studies. Several scenario and  sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Primary analyses showed statistically  significant reductions in the rate of arrhythmia recurrence with RF ablation with  Ablation Index compared to CB in unmatched, unadjusted (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.95)  and matched (0.42, 0.21-0.86) analyses. Greater reductions in the rate of arrhythmia  recurrence that favored RF ablation with Ablation Index were observed after matching  and adjusting for age (0.41, 0.20-0.85), age and left ventricular ejection fraction  (0.37, 0.16-0.88), and age, sex, and left ventricular ejection fraction (0.30,  0.13-0.71). Secondary and sensitivity analyses showed similar reductions.  CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation with Ablation Index was associated with  reductions in recurrence of atrial arrhythmias at 12 months compared to CB in  unmatched and unadjusted, matched, and matched and adjusted comparisons.",NA,"Hussein, Ahmed Gupta, Dhiraj De Potter, Tom Spin, Paul Eaton, Kiefer Goldstein, Laura Velleca, Maria Costa, Graça Grima, Daniel Patel, Leena Stabile, Giuseppe",Hussein A Gupta D De Potter T Spin P Eaton K Goldstein L Velleca M Costa G Grima D Patel L Stabile G,NA,"St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO, USA.

Hence, monitoring the efficacy of  antimalarial drugs is a key component of malaria control and elimination. The  published randomized trials that assessed comparisons of ACTs for treating  uncomplicated falciparum malaria reported conflicting results in treatment efficacy.  A network meta-analysis is an extension of pairwise meta-analysis that can  synthesize evidence simultaneously from both direct and indirect treatment  comparisons. The objective was to synthesize evidence on the comparative efficacy of  antimalarial drugs for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Asian  region. METHODS: Relevant randomized trials that assessed efficacy of antimalarial  drugs for patients having uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Asian region were  searched in health-related databases. We evaluated the methodological quality of the  included studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Main outcome was treatment  success at day 28 as determined by the absence of parasiteamia. We performed network  meta-analysis of the interventions in the trials, and assessed the overall quality  of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Seventeen randomized trials (n =  5043) were included in this network meta-analysis study. A network geometry was  formed with 14 antimalarial treatment options such as artemether-lumefantrine (AL),  artemisinin-piperaquine, artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ),  artesunate-chloroquine, artesunate-mefloquine home treatment, artesunate-mefloquine  2-day course, artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, chloroquine,  dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine home treatment,  dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 4-day course, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and  added artesunate, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. A maximum number of trials included was  DHP compared to ASMQ (n = 5). In general, DHP had better efficacy than AL at day 28  (DHP vs AL: OR 2.5, 95%CI:1.08-5.8). There is low certainty evidence due to limited  number of studies and small trials. DISCUSSION/ CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest  the superiority of DHP (3-day course) to AL and other comparator ACTs are with the  overall low/very low quality of evidence judgements. Moreover, one drug regimen is  better than another is only if current drug-resistance patterns are at play. For  example, the AL might be better than DHP in areas where both artemisinin and  piperaquine resistance patterns are prevalent. For substantiation, well-designed  larger trials from endemic countries are needed. In the light of benefit versus harm  concept, future analysis with safety information is recommended.",NA,"Naing, Cho Whittaker, Maxine A Htet, Norah Htet Aye, Saint Nway Mak, Joon Wah",Naing C Whittaker MA Htet NH Aye SN Mak JW,ORCID: 0000-0003-3425-7149 ORCID: 0000-0003-2143-8629 ORCID: 0000-0002-5428-7639,"International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

METHODS AND RESULTS: MEDLINE, Cochrane, ISI Web of Sciences, and SCOPUS  were searched for randomized or adjusted observational studies comparing NOACs vs.  VKAs for stroke prevention in AF patients ≥75 years. The primary efficacy and safety  outcomes of this meta-analysis were the composite of stroke and systemic embolism  (SSE) and major bleedings, respectively. Other secondary outcomes were also  analysed. The analysis included 22 studies enrolling 440 281 AF patients ≥ 75 years.  The risk of SSE was significantly lower with NOACs vs. VKAs [hazard ratio (HR) 0.79;  95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.89], whereas no differences were found for major  bleedings (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.85-1.05). NOACs reduced the risk of intracranial  bleeding (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.38-0.58), haemorrhagic stroke (HR 0.61; 95% CI  0.48-0.79) and fatal bleeding (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.30-0.72) but increased  gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.30-1.65), compared to VKAs. The  adjusted indirect comparison showed no significant differences in term of SSE  between NOAC agents. Conversely, the risk of major bleeding was higher for  rivaroxaban vs. apixaban (HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.39-2.08) and edoxaban (HR 1.37; 95% CI  1.14-1.67), and for dabigatran vs. apixaban (HR 1.47; 95% CI 1.18-1.85). CONCLUSION:  In elderly patients with AF, NOACs are associated to a lower risk of SSE,  intracranial bleeding, haemorrhagic stroke and fatal bleeding than VKAs, but  increase GI bleedings. In this analysis, the safety profile of individual NOAC  agents was significantly different.","Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. ©  The Author(s) 2019.

METHODS: Patient-level data from the SPARTAN study [apalutamide + androgen  deprivation therapy (ADT) versus placebo + ADT] and aggregate published data from  the PROSPER study (enzalutamide + ADT versus placebo + ADT) were used. Anchored  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted by weighting patients'  baseline characteristics from SPARTAN to match aggregated baseline characteristics  in PROSPER. Odds ratios (ORs) of reported adverse events (AEs) and  baseline-to-follow-up least squares mean differences in HRQoL [measured with  Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) score] with 95% credible  intervals were re-estimated for SPARTAN arms using weighted population and  indirectly compared with those in PROSPER through a Bayesian framework. Events of  special interest included fatigue, hot flush, nausea, diarrhea, hypertension, falls,  dizziness, decreased appetite, arthralgia, asthenia and headache. In addition, any  AEs and serious AEs were explored. RESULTS: Of 1207 SPARTAN patients, 1171 were  matched to 1401 PROSPER patients. Relative to enzalutamide, apalutamide demonstrated  better tolerability as evidenced by the highest probability of reduced occurrence of  fatigue [p(OR < 1) = 99.5%], hypertension [p(OR < 1) = 99.2%], decreased appetite  [p(OR < 1) = 98.3%], fall [p(OR < 1) = 90.3%], headaches [p(OR < 1) = 86.7%], and  nausea [p(OR < 1) = 80.0%]. The probabilities of reduced occurrence of any AEs and  SAEs with apalutamide versus enzalutamide were 66.9% and 90.9%, respectively.  Relative to enzalutamide, apalutamide treatment was associated with a higher  probability of a better HRQoL based on the FACT-P total score [p(diff > 0) = 73.1%].  The probability of a better HRQoL with apalutamide versus enzalutamide was highest  for the physical [p(diff > 0) = 97.3%] and functional [p(diff > 0) = 86.7%]  wellbeing subscales, and the pain-related subscale [p(diff > 0) = 90.1%].  CONCLUSION: Anchored MAIC suggests that treatment of men with nmCRPC with  apalutamide is associated with a higher probability of better tolerability due to  fewer AEs and better HRQoL than enzalutamide.",NA,"Chowdhury, Simon Oudard, Stéphane Uemura, Hiroji Joniau, Steven Pilon, Dominic Lefebvre, Patrick McQuarrie, Kelly Liu, Jinan Dearden, Lindsay Sermon, Jan Van Sanden, Suzy Diels, Joris Hadaschik, Boris A",Chowdhury S Oudard S Uemura H Joniau S Pilon D Lefebvre P McQuarrie K Liu J Dearden L Sermon J Van Sanden S Diels J Hadaschik BA,NA,"Department of Medical Oncology, Guy's, King's, and St. Thomas' Hospital, London, UK.  simon.chowdhury@gstt.nhs.uk.

In the absence of comparative studies between these  agents, the present study sought to indirectly compare metastasis-free survival  (MFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with nmCRPC who received these  therapies. METHODS: Individual patient-level data from SPARTAN (apalutamide plus  ADT) and published data from PROSPER (enzalutamide plus ADT) were utilized. An  anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted by weighting the  patients from the SPARTAN study to match baseline characteristics reported for  PROSPER. Hazard ratios (HRs) for MFS and OS were re-estimated for SPARTAN using  weighted Cox proportional hazards models and indirectly compared with those of  PROSPER using a Bayesian network meta-analysis. RESULTS: From the SPARTAN population  (N = 1207), a total of 1171 patients were matched to the PROSPER population  (N = 1401). The recalculated HRs (95% confidence interval) for apalutamide versus  ADT based on the reweighted SPARTAN data to mimic the PROSPER patient population  were 0.26 (0.21; 0.33) for MFS and 0.62 (0.41; 0.94) for OS. MAIC-based HRs (95%  credible interval) for apalutamide versus enzalutamide were 0.91 (0.68; 1.22) for  MFS and 0.77 (0.46; 1.30) for OS. The Bayesian probabilities of apalutamide being  more effective than enzalutamide were 73.6% for MFS and 83.5% for OS. CONCLUSIONS:  MAIC results suggest that nmCRPC patients treated with apalutamide have a higher  probability of a more favorable MFS and OS compared with those treated with  enzalutamide.",NA,"Chowdhury, Simon Oudard, Stéphane Uemura, Hiroji Joniau, Steven Pilon, Dominic Ladouceur, Martin Behl, Ajay S Liu, Jinan Dearden, Lindsay Sermon, Jan Van Sanden, Suzy Diels, Joris Hadaschik, Boris A",Chowdhury S Oudard S Uemura H Joniau S Pilon D Ladouceur M Behl AS Liu J Dearden L Sermon J Van Sanden S Diels J Hadaschik BA,NA,"Department of Medical Oncology, Guy's, King's, and St. Thomas' Hospital, London, UK.  simon.chowdhury@gstt.nhs.uk.

Although MCL usually responds well to  initial treatment with chemotherapy-based regimens, the disease often relapses or  becomes refractory within a few years. Acalabrutinib is a highly selective, potent,  covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor with minimal off-target activity. WIthout  head-to-head clinical trial data, estimation of the comparative efficacy and safety  of new therapeutic entities provides valuable information for patients, clinicians,  and health care payers. The objective of this analysis was to compare the efficacy  and safety of acalabrutinib versus other targeted therapies employed for the  treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL by using matching-adjusted indirect  comparisons. METHODS: Individual data from 124 patients treated with acalabrutinib  in the Phase II ACE-LY-004 trial were adjusted to match average baseline  characteristics of populations from studies using alternative targeted treatment  regimens for relapsed/refractory MCL (for monotherapy: ibrutinib, bortezomib,  lenalidomide, and temsirolimus; for combination therapies: ibrutinib + rituximab,  bendamustine + rituximab, and lenalidomide + rituximab). Patient populations were  matched on age, sex, race, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status,  Simplified MCL International Prognostic Index score, tumor bulk, lactate  dehydrogenase concentration, extranodal disease, bone marrow involvement, and number  of previous treatment regimens. Outcomes assessed included overall response rate  (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival  (PFS), and adverse events. FINDINGS: After matching, acalabrutinib was associated  with significant increases in ORR and CR rate (estimated treatment difference [95%  CI]) versus ibrutinib (ORR, 9.3% [0.3-18.3]; CR, 14.9% [5.4-24.3]), bortezomib (ORR,  50.6% [40.2-61.0]; CR, 18.8% [9.1-28.5]), lenalidomide (ORR, 38.1% [27.1-49.1]; CR,  43.5% [34.8-52.3]), and temsirolimus (ORR, 40.7% [31.0-50.4]; CR, 27.1%  [19.2-35.0]). PFS (hazard ratio [95% CI]) with acalabrutinib was significantly  increased versus bortezomib (0.36 [0.26-0.51]), lenalidomide (0.65 [0.48-0.89]),  lenalidomide + rituximab (0.57 [0.35-0.93]), and temsirolimus (0.33 [0.24-0.45]).  Acalabrutinib was associated with significantly increased OS (hazard ratio) versus  bortezomib (0.36 [0.22-0.61]) and temsirolimus (0.32 [0.23-0.44]). The overall  safety profile of acalabrutinib was similar or better compared with the  monotherapies; however, infection risk increased versus bendamustine + rituximab,  and anemia increased risk versus lenalidomide + rituximab and ibrutinib + rituximab.  IMPLICATIONS: This comparison of targeted therapies used in the treatment of  relapsed/refractory MCL showed that acalabrutinib has the potential to provide  increased response rates, with trends for increased PFS and OS, and an improved  safety profile.",Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: We customized a Markov model with ten  health states to estimate the lifetime economic and clinical outcomes in 6-week  cycles. The efficacy (clinical event rates per 100 patient-years) and safety data  were derived from a pairwise indirect treatment comparison. The analysis was  conducted from both the national health service (NHS) and societal perspectives, and  included pharmaceutical costs (retail price plus value-added tax (VAT) and  applicable national deductions) according to daily dosages (apixaban 10 mg (5 mg  twice daily (bid)) and edoxaban 60 or 30 mg) and complications and  disease-management costs, obtained from national databases. Utilities for  quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) calculations reflected EuroQoL 5-Dimension scores  in patients with AF. An annual discount rate of 3% was applied for costs (€, year  2019 values) and outcomes. RESULTS: In a 1000-patient cohort, apixaban 5 mg bid  versus edoxaban 60 mg could avoid five strokes, six major bleedings and 29  clinically relevant non-major bleedings (CRNMBs). Compared with edoxaban 30 mg,  apixaban could avoid 21 strokes and two SEs. An increase in bleedings was observed  with apixaban (seven haemorrhagic strokes, 48 major bleedings and 17 CRNMBs).  Apixaban yielded 0.04 additional QALYs compared with edoxaban 60 mg or 30 mg.  Incremental costs/QALY were €9639.33 and €354.22 for apixaban versus edoxaban 60 mg  and edoxaban 30 mg, respectively, from the NHS perspective and €7756.62 for apixaban  versus edoxaban 60 mg from the societal perspective. Apixaban was dominant versus  edoxaban 30 mg from the societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the  robustness of the model.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the budget impact of dabrafenib and trametinib in  combination for adjuvant treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive  resected Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC melanoma from a U.S. commercial payer perspective  using data from the COMBI-AD trial, as well as other sources. METHODS: The budget  impact of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination for patients with BRAF V600E/K  mutation-positive, resected Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC melanoma was evaluated from  the perspective of a hypothetical population of 1 million members with demographic  characteristics consistent with those of a commercially insured U.S. insurance plan  (i.e., adults aged less than 65 years) using an economic model developed in  Microsoft Excel. The model compared melanoma-related health care costs over a 3-year  projection period under 2 scenarios: (1) a reference scenario in which dabrafenib  and trametinib are assumed to be unavailable for adjuvant therapy and (2) a new  scenario in which the combination is assumed to be available. Treatments potentially  displaced by dabrafenib and trametinib were assumed to include observation,  high-dose interferon alpha-2b, ipilimumab, and nivolumab. Costs considered in the  model include those of adjuvant therapies and treatment of locoregional and distant  recurrences. The numbers of patients eligible for treatment with dabrafenib and  trametinib were based on data from cancer registries, published sources, and  assumptions. Treatment mixes under the reference and new scenarios were based on  market research data, clinical expert opinion, and assumptions. Probabilities of  recurrence and death were based on data from the COMBI-AD trial and an indirect  treatment comparison. Medication costs were based on wholesale acquisition cost  prices. Costs of distant recurrence were from a health insurance claims study.  RESULTS: In a hypothetical population of 1 million commercially insured members, 48  patients were estimated to become eligible for treatment with dabrafenib and  trametinib in combination over the 3-year projection period; in the new scenario, 10  patients were projected to receive such treatment. Cumulative costs of  melanoma-related care were estimated to be $6.3 million in the reference scenario  and $6.9 million in the new scenario. The budget impact of dabrafenib and trametinib  in combination was an increase of $549 thousand overall and 1.5 cents per member per  month. CONCLUSIONS: For a hypothetical U.S. commercial health plan of 1 million  members, the budget impact of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination as adjuvant  treatment for melanoma is likely to be relatively modest and within the range of  published estimates for oncology therapies. These results may assist payers in  making coverage decisions regarding the use of adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib in  melanoma.

Guselkumab has demonstrated  additional benefit in patients with early inadequate response to ustekinumab.  Long-term efficacy comparisons of guselkumab and ustekinumab are currently lacking  among ustekinumab-naive patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative efficacy of  guselkumab and ustekinumab for maintenance therapy of moderate-to-severe plaque  psoriasis, using individual patient data (IPD) from randomized controlled trials.  METHODS: IPD for guselkumab from the VOYAGE 1 and 2 trials were pooled and compared  with IPD for ustekinumab from the NAVIGATE trial. Multivariable logistic regression  analyses compared guselkumab 100 mg and ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg for the  achievement and maintenance of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90, 75 and  100 responses up to 40 weeks. The regression models accounted for a range of  clinically relevant covariates (e.g. age, sex, psoriasis duration). Relative  efficacy was expressed using odds ratios (ORs) and predicted probability of  treatment response associated with each intervention. RESULTS: Patients receiving  guselkumab had significantly higher probabilities of achieving a PASI 90 response  than patients receiving ustekinumab, at both week 16 [70·4% vs. 46·0%, OR 2·79, 95%  confidence interval (CI) 2·22-3·45] and week 40 (74·2% vs. 54·5%, OR 2·40, 95% CI  1·89-3·13]. Guselkumab was also associated with a significantly increased likelihood  of achieving both PASI 75 and PASI 100 responses at weeks 16 and 40, compared with  ustekinumab. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted analyses leveraging IPD demonstrate that  guselkumab has a significantly higher probability of achieving and maintaining PASI  treatment responses through week 40 than ustekinumab does.",© 2019 The Authors.

OBJECTIVES: Given the rapid effect of brexanolone injection (within 60 h) sustained  throughout the length of the trials (30 days), we sought to compare its efficacy  data against selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the class of  antidepressants most commonly prescribed for PPD, using HAM-D and Edinburgh  Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) outcomes from currently available RCTs. METHODS:  We extracted data from 26 studies identified in a systematic literature review of  pharmacological and pharmacological/nonpharmacological combination therapies in PPD.  Six studies were suitable to form evidence networks through which to perform  indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) of HAM-D and EPDS outcomes between brexanolone  and SSRIs. Having assessed the comparability and suitability of the available  evidence for analysis, we discovered significant heterogeneity in the study designs,  most notably in the placebo arms of the trials. We therefore conducted  matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) between brexanolone and the placebo  arms of comparator studies, subsequently using the MAIC results of brexanolone  versus placebo, and results for SSRIs versus placebo, to form ITCs of brexanolone  versus SSRIs at three separate time points-day 3, week 4 and last observation. ITCs  were calculated as the differences in change from baseline (CFB) in HAM-D and,  separately, CFB in EPDS, between treatments, and reported with 95% confidence  intervals (CIs). RESULTS: For all time points, MAICs showed larger differences in  CFB for brexanolone compared with SSRIs. Differences (95% CIs) between brexanolone  and SSRIs were 12.79 (8.04-17.53) [day 3], 5.87 (- 1.62 to 13.37) [week 4] and 0.97  (- 6.35 to 8.30) [last observation] for the HAM-D. For the EPDS, the differences in  CFB were 7.98 (5.32-10.64) [day 3], 6.35 (3.13-9.57) [week 4] and 4.05 (0.79-7.31)  [last observation]. Other analytical approaches are also presented to demonstrate  the similarity of results, using a network meta-analysis approach, and the  importance of using the MAIC method to control for the important heterogeneity  between placebo arms. CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledging the limitations of ITCs and this  evidence base, when compared with SSRIs, these analyses suggest that brexanolone  demonstrated larger differences in CFB for both patient- and clinician-reported PPD  outcomes and at all investigated time points after adjusting for differences between  placebos in the included studies.",NA,"Cooper, Miranda C Kilvert, Hannah S Hodgkins, Paul Roskell, Neil S Eldar-Lissai, Adi",Cooper MC Kilvert HS Hodgkins P Roskell NS Eldar-Lissai A,NA,"BresMed Health Solutions Ltd, Sheffield, UK.

We suspect that this issue may be  partially attributable to limitations in current NMA software which do not readily  produce all of the output needed to satisfy current guidelines. RESULTS: To better  facilitate the conduct and reporting of NMAs, we have created an R package called  ""BUGSnet"" (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling to conduct a Network  meta-analysis). This R package relies upon Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) to  conduct Bayesian NMA using a generalized linear model. BUGSnet contains a suite of  functions that can be used to describe the evidence network, estimate a model and  assess the model fit and convergence, assess the presence of heterogeneity and  inconsistency, and output the results in a variety of formats including league  tables and surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA) plots. We provide a  demonstration of the functions contained within BUGSnet by recreating a Bayesian NMA  found in the second technical support document composed by the National Institute  for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit (NICE-DSU). We have also mapped  these functions to checklist items within current reporting and best practice  guidelines. CONCLUSION: BUGSnet is a new R package that can be used to conduct a  Bayesian NMA and produce all of the necessary output needed to satisfy current  scientific and regulatory standards. We hope that this software will help to improve  the conduct and reporting of NMAs.",NA,"Béliveau, Audrey Boyne, Devon J Slater, Justin Brenner, Darren Arora, Paul",Béliveau A Boyne DJ Slater J Brenner D Arora P,ORCID: 0000-0003-4124-2498,"Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, University of Waterloo, 200  University Avenue West, Waterloo, Ontario, N2L 3G1, Canada.  audrey.beliveau@waterloo.ca.

Unlike  traditional antidiabetic therapies, modern treatment options such as fixed-ratio  combinations of basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists are  associated with improved glycemic control, reduced body weight and low risk of  hypoglycemia. The cost-effectiveness of the fixed-ratio combinations of basal  insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists IDegLira and iGlarLixi was  assessed for Italy in patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, to evaluate  how short-term clinical benefits translate into long-term health economic outcomes.  METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical and economic  outcomes over patient lifetimes. Treatment effects were sourced from an indirect  treatment comparison. The analysis captured direct medical costs (expressed in 2017  Euros) from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS) and  patient-related quality of life. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS:  IDegLira was associated with gains of 0.09 life years and 0.13 quality-adjusted life  years (QALYs) relative to iGlarLixi, due to a lower cumulative incidence and delayed  onset of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was associated with an incremental  cost of EUR 930 over patient lifetimes, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness  ratio of EUR 7,386 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Over the lifetime of patients with  T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, IDegLira was associated with improved clinical  outcomes at higher costs relative to iGlarLixi. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of  EUR 30,000 per QALY gained, IDegLira was considered to be cost-effective versus  iGlarLixi from the perspective of the Italian NHS.",© 2019 Pöhlmann et al.,"Pöhlmann, Johannes Montagnoli, Roberta Lastoria, Giusi Parekh, Witesh Markert, Marie Hunt, Barnaby",Pöhlmann J Montagnoli R Lastoria G Parekh W Markert M Hunt B,ORCID: 0000-0002-2276-447X ORCID: 0000-0001-5420-279X,"Health Economics, Ossian Health Economics and Communications, Basel 4051,  Switzerland.

We conducted a direct and indirect comparison meta-analysis to evaluate the best  choice in preventing post-ESD bleeding among proton pump inhibitors (PPIs),  histamine(2)-receptor antagonists (H(2)RAs), and the most widely used  potassium-competitive acid blocker, vonoprazan. Methods: The Pubmed, Cochrane  Library, and Embase were searched for randomized trials. We pooled odds ratios (OR)  for preventing post-ESD bleeding using meta-analysis. Results: Sixteen randomized  trials met the inclusion criteria including 2,062 patients. Direct comparisons  showed slightly significant efficacy in PPIs rather than H(2)RAs in preventing  post-ESD bleeding [OR: 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10 to 3.05] and  vonoprazan was better than PPIs (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.86). The adjusted  indirect comparison indicated vonoprazan was superior to H(2)RAs (OR: 0.30, 95% CI:  0.12 to 0.74). In subgroup analysis, PPIs had similar efficacy as H(2)RAs in 4  weeks, while PPIs were better than H(2)RAs in 8 weeks' treatment (OR: 1.91; 95% CI:  1.08 to 3.40). The superiority of vonoprazan than PPIs was more significant in  combination therapy (OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.69). There was a significant  difference in vonoprazan for 8 weeks of medication (OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.92).  Conclusions: The effects of vonoprazan is better than PPIs than H(2)RAs in  preventing bleeding after ESD. When vonoprazan combined with mucosal protective  antiulcer drug in treatment or used in 8 weeks of medication, the efficacy may be  even better.","Copyright © 2019 Jiang, Li, Xie, Liang, Wan, Jiang, Zhang and Wu.","Jiang, Xin Li, Jiahao Xie, Jingmei Liang, Zhuoru Wan, Ning Jiang, Jie Zhang, Tiantian Wu, Yingyu",Jiang X Li J Xie J Liang Z Wan N Jiang J Zhang T Wu Y,NA,"School of International Pharmaceutical Business, China Pharmaceutical University,  Nanjing, China.

This study assessed the  cost-effectiveness (CE) of empagliflozin + SoC in comparison to sitagliptin + SoC  and saxagliptin + SoC based on the respective CVOT. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes  Model (CDM) was calibrated to reproduce the CVOT outcomes. EMPA-REG OUTCOME baseline  characteristics and CVOT specific treatment effects on risk factors for  cardiovascular disease [glycated haemogloblin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI),  blood pressure, lipids] were applied. Three-year observed cardiovascular events of  empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC were derived from  EMPA-REG OUTCOME and an indirect treatment comparison. Relative risk (RR)  adjustments to calibrate the CDM were estimated after consecutive attempts of  running the model until the observed and CDM-predicted outcomes matched closely. The  drug-specific treatment effects were considered up until treatment switch (when  HbA1c reached 8.5%), after which, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study  (UKPDS) 82 risk equations predicted events based on co-existing risk factors and  treatment intensification to basal-bolus insulin were applied. The analysis was  conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Costs and quality  of life data were derived from UK national sources and published literature. A  50-year time horizon and discount rate of 3.5% were applied. RESULTS: The CDM  projected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 6.408, 5.917 and 5.704 and total  costs of 50,801 GBP, 47,627 GBP and 48,071 GBP for empagliflozin + SoC,  sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC, respectively. The incremental CE ratio  (ICER) of empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC was  6464 GBP/QALY and 3878 GBP/QALY, respectively. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity  analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: Results suggest  that empagliflozin + SoC is cost-effective compared to sitagliptin + SoC and  saxagliptin + SoC at a willingness to pay threshold of 20,000 GBP/QALY.

In this study, a literature-based analysis was  undertaken to assess, via an indirect treatment comparison, the comparative efficacy  of BV to salvage chemotherapy as treatment for R/R cHL patients following ASCT. This  comparative effectiveness research was undertaken to support a reimbursement  submission for BV to the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.  Retrospective analysis of individual patient data from four data sources  demonstrated that the use of BV as first salvage treatment in cHL patients relapsing  or progressing post-ASCT achieved improvements in both clinical response and overall  survival. More specifically, BV was associated with an incremental improvement of  22% in overall response rate compared to salvage chemotherapy. Five-year overall  survival and progression-free survival rates were 92·2% [95% confidence interval  (CI): 85·5-99·3%] and 32·2% (95% CI: 19·1-54·6%) respectively for BV, compared to  30·5% (95% CI: 22·2-42·0%) and 3·2% (95% CI: 1·1-8·9%) respectively for salvage  chemotherapy.

No head-to-head trial data  were available to compare the efficacy of nivolumab to that of observation, so  indirect treatment comparisons were required. Additionally, overall survival (OS)  data were not available from CheckMate-238, and the clinical pathway for melanoma  has changed significantly over the last decade. Four modelling options were  developed using different methods and evidence sources to estimate OS and the impact  of nivolumab on predicted life-years in the adjuvant setting; however, this article  focuses on two primary methods. METHODS: RFS for nivolumab and observation were  informed by a patient-level data meta-regression. The first model was a partitioned  survival model, where the parametric OS curve for observation was derived from  CA184-029 and nivolumab OS was based on a surrogacy relationship between RFS and OS  specific to adjuvant melanoma. The other option used a state-transition model to  estimate post-recurrence survival using different data sources. RESULTS: The  modelling options estimated different OS for both nivolumab and observation but  demonstrated at least a 32% increase in life-years gained for nivolumab versus  observation. CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrated the difficulties in modelling  within the adjuvant setting. Each model produced different survival projections,  showing the need to explore different techniques to address the extent of  uncertainty. This also highlighted the importance of understanding the impact of RFS  in the long term in a setting where the aim of treatment is to remain disease free.",NA,"Batteson, Rachael Hart, Rose Hemstock, Matthew Gooden, Kyna Kotapati, Srividya Roze, Stephane Lee, Dawn Amadi, Adenike",Batteson R Hart R Hemstock M Gooden K Kotapati S Roze S Lee D Amadi A,ORCID: 0000-0002-8319-0609,"BresMed, Steel City House, West Street, Sheffield, S1 2GQ, UK.  rbatteson@bresmed.com.

In 2018, the FDA approved combination  glasdegib (GLAS) plus LDAC based on Phase II results demonstrating improved overall  survival (OS) versus LDAC alone in previously untreated AML. However, no randomized  clinical trials have directly compared GLAS + LDAC with other AML treatments.  OBJECTIVE: Using both indirect treatment comparison (ITC) and simulated treatment  comparison (STC), which adjusts for baseline differences between trials, the  comparative effectiveness of GLAS + LDAC was compared with hypomethylating agent  azacitidine (AZA) or decitabine (DEC). METHODS: A systematic literature review  identified published trials of AZA or DEC versus LDAC among older AML patients  ineligible for high-intensity chemotherapy. In addition to standard and  covariate-adjusted ITC, STC was performed following guidance from the NICE Decision  Support Unit (DSU). Using individual patient data from the Phase II GLAS + LDAC  study, population-specific OS hazard ratios (HR) for GLAS + LDAC versus AZA or DEC  were compared. Furthermore, covariate-adjusted ITC (Cox multivariate models) and STC  were repeated using GLAS + LDAC versus LDAC data propensity-weighted for  within-trial mean cytogenetic risk. As this initial step was not specified in the  DSU, results from this second method were compared to the first STC following DSU  guidance only. RESULTS: Standard ITC and STC both demonstrated significantly  improved OS for GLAS + LDAC versus either AZA or DEC. Adjusting for key covariates,  STC stepwise exponential models demonstrated GLAS + LDAC superiority to both AZA  (HR=0.424; 95% CI: 0.228, 0.789) and DEC (HR=0.505; 95% CI: 0.269, 0.949). These  significant results held using full or step-wise approaches, following DSU guidance  only or the weighted STC approach. CONCLUSION: Using ITC and STC, GLAS + LDAC  demonstrated superior OS to AZA or DEC in an adult population with previously  untreated AML for whom intensive chemotherapy is not an option.",© 2019 Tremblay et al.,"Tremblay, Gabriel Westley, Tracy Cappelleri, Joseph C Arondekar, Bhakti Chan, Geoffrey Bell, Timothy J Briggs, Andrew",Tremblay G Westley T Cappelleri JC Arondekar B Chan G Bell TJ Briggs A,NA,"Purple Squirrel Economics, New York, NY, USA.

Events may happen any time during that  interval but can only be detected during a planned or unplanned visit. Disease  progression in oncology is a notable example where the time to an event is affected  by the schedule of visits within a study. This can become a source of bias when  studies with varying assessment schedules are used in unanchored comparisons using  methods such as matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. OBJECTIVE: We illustrate  assessment-time bias (ATB) in a simulation study based on data from a recent study  in second-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma,  and present a method to adjust for differences in assessment schedule when comparing  progression-free survival (PFS) against a competing treatment. METHODS: A  multi-state model for death and progression was used to generate simulated death and  progression times, from which PFS times were derived. PFS data were also generated  for a hypothetical comparator treatment by applying a constant hazard ratio (HR) to  the baseline treatment. Simulated PFS times for the two treatments were then aligned  to different assessment schedules so that progression events were only observed at  set visit times, and the data were analysed to assess the bias and standard error of  estimates of HRs between two treatments with and without assessment-schedule  matching (ASM). RESULTS: ATB is highly affected by the rate of the event at the  first assessment time; in our examples, the bias ranged from 3 to 11% as the event  rate increased. The proposed method relies on individual-level data from a study and  attempts to adjust the timing of progression events to the comparator's schedule by  shifting them forward or backward without altering the patients' actual follow-up  time. The method removed the bias almost completely in all scenarios without  affecting the precision of estimates of comparative effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS:  Considering the increasing use of unanchored comparative analyses for novel cancer  treatments based on single-arm studies, the proposed method offers a relatively  simple means of improving the accuracy of relative benefits of treatments on  progression times.",NA,"Kapetanakis, Venediktos Prawitz, Thibaud Schlichting, Michael Ishak, K Jack Phatak, Hemant Kearney, Mairead Stevens, John W Benedict, Agnes Bharmal, Murtuza",Kapetanakis V Prawitz T Schlichting M Ishak KJ Phatak H Kearney M Stevens JW Benedict A Bharmal M,ORCID: 0000-0002-4147-0549,"Evidence Synthesis, Modeling & Communication, Evidera, The Ark, 2nd Floor, 201  Talgarth Road, London, W6 8BJ, UK. venediktos.kapetanakis@evidera.com.

Methods: A SLR was conducted to identify randomized  clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating approved adjuvant treatments including  interferon-containing regimens, BRAF-inhibitors, and PD-L1 inhibitors in stage III  melanoma patients. Relative treatment effects for recurrence-free survival (RFS)  were synthesized with Bayesian NMA models that allowed for hazard ratios (HRs) to  vary over time. Results: Included studies formed a connected network of evidence  composed of eight trials. In high-risk stage III patients, the HR for pembrolizumab  vs observation decreased significantly over time with the superiority of  pembrolizumab over observation becoming statistically meaningful before 3 months. By  9 months, the HR for pembrolizumab vs observation was statistically significantly  lower than the HR for most other treatments vs observation, with the exception of  ipilimumab and biochemotherapy due to overlapping 95% credible intervals. In  BRAF + patients, pembrolizumab was statistically significantly better than  observation after 3 months. The HR for both BRAF-inhibitors vs observation increased  significantly over time and pembrolizumab was statistically superior to both  BRAF-inhibitors after 15 months. Conclusions: Pembrolizumab results in statistically  significantly improved RFS compared to all competing regimens after 9 months, except  ipilimumab and biochemotherapy, for the adjuvant treatment of stage III melanoma.  However, point estimate HRs vs observation for pembrolizumab are much lower than  those for ipilimumab. In BRAF + patients, the advantage of pembrolizumab versus  competing interventions increases over time with respect to RFS.",NA,"Lorenzi, Maria Arndorfer, Stella Aguiar-Ibañez, Raquel Scherrer, Emilie Liu, Frank Xiaoqing Krepler, Clemens",Lorenzi M Arndorfer S Aguiar-Ibañez R Scherrer E Liu FX Krepler C,NA,"Precision Xtract, Oakland, CA, USA.

A pivotal trial compared nivolumab with ipilimumab; however, no  head-to-head trial exists comparing nivolumab to observation, a common comparator in  the adjuvant setting. Here, we compared the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of  nivolumab with observation or ipilimumab as adjuvant therapies in resected stage  IIIB/C melanoma. METHODS: Patient data were pooled from the EORTC 18071 and  CheckMate 238 trials using propensity score weighting and adjusting for cross-trial  differences. Number needed to treat (NNT) and costs per recurrence-free life-month  (RFLM) at 12, 16, 18, and 24 months (as data allowed) were estimated. Costs included  drug acquisition, administration costs, and direct medical costs. Sensitivity  analyses including patients with stage IIIB/C and resected stage IV melanoma were  conducted. RESULTS: A total of 1287 patients (278 nivolumab, 365 observation, and  644 ipilimumab) with resected stage IIIB/C melanoma were pooled. NNTs to achieve one  additional recurrence-free survivor with nivolumab versus observation were 3.93 at  12 months and 3.42 at 24 months; NNTs for nivolumab versus ipilimumab were 7.97 at  12 months and 6.43 at 24 months. Mean drug costs per RFLM were lower for nivolumab  at 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively (nivolumab: $13,447, $9462, and $7370;  ipilimumab: $52,734, $40,484, and $33,875). Mean medical costs per RFLM were the  lowest for nivolumab versus observation or ipilimumab at 12 months ($449 versus $674  or $1531) and 16 months ($383 versus $808 or $1316). The sensitivity analysis  results were consistent with the base case. CONCLUSION: For resected melanoma,  adjuvant nivolumab is both clinically effective and cost-effective compared with  observation or ipilimumab. Adjuvant nivolumab was associated with a lower drug cost  per RFLM compared with ipilimumab, and a lower medical cost compared with  observation. Future analyses incorporating long-term follow-up data may help  increase understanding of the economic impact of nivolumab in the adjuvant setting.

OBJECTIVE: To compare acupuncture with propranolol using  indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE,  and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Randomized controlled  trials comparing acupuncture or propranolol with sham acupuncture, placebo,  waiting-list control or usual care were included. We extracted information from the  included trials using a standardized extraction form. The primary outcome was  migraine episodes. The secondary outcomes included migraine days, migraine  frequency, and adverse events. RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs (n = 3656) after  screening 1078 articles. The analysis showed that acupuncture had a significant  advantage over propranolol in reducing migraine episodes over a 4-week period (SMD -  0.74, 95% CI - 1.04 to - 0.44). Acupuncture also had a significant advantage over  waiting-list control in decreasing migraine frequency (SMD - 1.57, 95% CI - 2.08 to  - 1.06). Acupuncture caused fewer adverse events than propranolol (RR 0.82, 95% CI  0.11-5.94). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture had a better effect than propranolol in  reducing migraine episodes in indirect comparison. The result should be confirmed in  subsequent head-to-head studies.

In rare diseases such as hemophilia, where small populations  preclude head-to-head comparisons in randomized controlled trials, outcomes from  different studies can be compared by matching-adjusted indirect treatment  comparisons (MAICs) via matched summary statistics of individual patient data. This  study compared MAIC-adjusted outcomes of BAY 94-9027 with other FVIII agents for  prophylaxis of hemophilia. Methods: Weighted patient data from the BAY 94-9027  PROTECT VIII trial were used to compare annualized bleeding rates (ABRs), percentage  of patients with zero bleeds, and factor utilization against published data on  rFVIII-Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc), BAX 855, and recombinant antihemophilic  factor/plasma/albumin-free method (rAHF-PFM). Results: After matching BAY 94-9027  and comparators, the mean BAY 94-9027 utilization was significantly lower than  rFVIIIFc pre- and post-matching (66.2 vs 82.2 IU/kg/week; 66.5 vs 82.2 IU/kg/week;  both P<0.001). Median BAY 94-9027 utilization (IU/kg/week) trended lower than BAX  855 (64.3 vs 87.4) and rAHF-PFM (2004 study: 64.0 vs 107.5; 2012 study: 63.6 vs  109.9). Mean ABRs and percentages of patients with zero bleeds were similar  post-matching between BAY 94-9027 and comparators.

Cisplatin-ineligible patients experience a high frequency of adverse  events from the most commonly used standard of care treatment, carboplatin plus  gemcitabine, or alternative treatment with gemcitabine monotherapy. Pembrolizumab is  a potent, highly selective humanised monoclonal antibody that releases checkpoint  inhibition of the immune response system, and provides a new alternative for these  patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for  first-line treatment of urothelial carcinoma ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy  in patients with strongly PD-L1-positive tumours in Sweden. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: Parametric survival curves were fitted to overall survival,  progression-free survival, and time on treatment data from KEYNOTE-052 to  extrapolate clinical outcomes. A simulated treatment comparison and a network  meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of pembrolizumab  versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine monotherapy. EQ-5D data from  KEYNOTE-052 were used to estimate utility, while resource use and cost inputs were  estimated using Swedish regional pricing lists and clinician opinion. OUTCOME  MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The model reported costs, life years, and  quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and results were tested using deterministic and  probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We estimated that  pembrolizumab would improve survival by 2.11 and 2.16 years and increase QALYs by  1.71 and 1.75 compared to carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine monotherapy,  respectively. Pembrolizumab was associated with a cost increase of €90520 versus  carboplatin plus gemcitabine and €95055 versus gemcitabine, with corresponding  incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of €53055/QALY and €54415/QALY. CONCLUSIONS:  At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €100000/QALY, pembrolizumab is a cost-effective  treatment versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and versus gemcitabine.

Following the  availability of two new drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone, a number of network  meta-analyses (NMAs) of randomised controlled trials have been published which have  conducted indirect comparisons on the two drugs. Differing recommendations from  these studies are potentially confusing to clinicians and decision-makers. We aimed  to systematically review published NMAs of IPF treatments, to compare their findings  and summarise key recommendations. Materials and Methods: We systematically reviewed  (PROSPERO: CRD42017072876) six eligible NMAs and investigated the differences in  their findings with respect to key endpoints. We focused on differences in  head-to-head comparisons between nintedanib and pirfenidone. Results: The NMAs were  broadly consistent, with most differences being explained by model choice, endpoint  definitions, inclusion of different studies, different follow-up durations, and  access to unpublished data. A substantive difference remained, however, in the  change from baseline forced vital capacity (FVC). One NMA favoured nintedanib,  another found no statistical difference, whilst others did not conduct the analysis.  These differences can be attributed to the choice of methodology, the use of the  standardised mean difference (SMD) scale, and population heterogeneity. Conclusions:  NMA methods facilitated the comparison of nintedanib and pirfenidone in the absence  of a head-to-head trial. However, further work is needed to determine whether the  trial populations are homogeneous and whether the SMD is appropriate in this  population. Differences in patient characteristics may obscure the difference in  treatment effects. To assist decision-makers, an exploration of efficacy in  real-world populations may be prudent.",NA,"Scott, David A Loveman, Emma Colquitt, Jill L O'Reilly, Katherine",Scott DA Loveman E Colquitt JL O'Reilly K,ORCID: 0000-0001-8226-2634,"Diabetes Research Centre, College of Life Sciences, University of Leicester,  Leicester Diabetes Centre, Leicester General Hospital, Gwendolen Road, Leicester LE5  4PW, UK.

However, the situation often arises where a researcher has IPD for trials concerning  a particular treatment (eg, from a sponsor) but none for other trials. Therefore,  one can reweight the IPD so that the covariate characteristics in the IPD trials  match that of the aggregate data (AgD) trials, using a matching-adjusted indirect  comparison (MAIC). We assess the impact of using the reweighted aggregated data,  obtained by the MAIC, in a Bayesian NMA for a connected treatment network. We apply  this method to a network of multiple myeloma treatments in newly diagnosed patients  (ndMM), where the outcome is progression free survival. We investigate the  reliability of the methods and results through a simulation study. The ndMM network  consists of three IPD studies comparing lenalidomide to placebo (Len-Placebo), one  AgD study comparing Len-Placebo, and one AgD study comparing thalidomide to placebo  (Thal-Placebo). We therefore investigate two options of weighting the covariates:  (a) All three studies are weighted separately to match the AgD Thal-Placebo trial.  (b) Patients are weighted across all three IPD studies to match the AgD Thal-Placebo  trial, but the NMA considers each trial separately. We observe limited benefit to  MAIC in the full network population. While MAIC can be beneficial as a sensitivity  analysis to confirm results across patient populations, we advise that MAIC is used  and interpreted with caution.","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Leahy, Joy Walsh, Cathal",Leahy J Walsh C,ORCID: 0000-0002-6567-9099 ORCID: 0000-0001-6599-9562,"School of Computer Science and Statistics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.

Recalculated outcomes from FUTURE  2, 3, and 5 (150 mg, effective sample size (ESS) post-matching=104; 300 mg, ESS=75;  and placebo, ESS=159) were compared with the NCT00317499 trial. Pairwise comparisons  using odds ratios (ORs) were performed for the American College of Rheumatology  (ACR) 20, 50, and 70 response criteria at week 12 (placebo-adjusted) and week 24  (non-placebo-adjusted). RESULTS: At week 12, there were no significant differences  in ACR responses between secukinumab and etanercept. There was no significant  difference between secukinumab 150 mg and etanercept at week 24 with respect to ACR  20 and 50 response rates; however, ACR 70 response rates were higher for secukinumab  150 mg (OR (95% confidence interval (CI)): 4.48 (2.01-9.99), p<0.001). ACR 20, 50,  and 70 response rates were higher with secukinumab 300 mg than with etanercept at  this time point (OR (95% CI): ACR 20, 3.28 (1.69-6.38), p<0.001; ACR 50, 1.90  (1.04-3.50), p=0.038; and ACR 70, 3.56 (1.51-8.40), p=0.004). CONCLUSION: In this  MAIC, secukinumab was associated with higher ACR 20 and 50 (secukinumab 300 mg) and  70 (secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg) response rates at week 24 than etanercept in  biologic-naïve patients with active PsA, whereas no significant difference was  observed in the short-term at week 12.",NA,"Mease, Philip Choy, Ernest Nash, Peter Kalyvas, Chrysostomos Hunger, Matthias Pricop, Luminita Gandhi, Kunal K Jugl, Steffen M Thom, Howard",Mease P Choy E Nash P Kalyvas C Hunger M Pricop L Gandhi KK Jugl SM Thom H,ORCID: 0000-0002-6620-0457 ORCID: 0000-0003-4459-8609 ORCID: 0000-0002-2571-788X ORCID: 0000-0003-0606-4518 ORCID: 0000-0003-2075-2958 ORCID: 0000-0003-2919-3013 ORCID: 0000-0002-7478-6953 ORCID: 0000-0001-8746-7890 ORCID: 0000-0001-8576-5552,"Swedish Medical Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.

METHODS: A comprehensive search of online databases was performed. A  traditional meta-analysis was performed to determine the risk ratio of BVM vs. LMA  and ETI vs. LMA. Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) were conducted to compare BVM  and ETI. RESULTS: A total of 13 full-text articles reporting the efficacy of BVM,  ETI, and LMA were considered in this analysis. BVM and LMA had the same effect  regarding return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (23% vs. 24%; RR =0.84), survival  rate at admission (19% vs. 21%; RR =0.82) or discharge (6% vs. 4%; RR =0.61). ETI  was superior to LMA in terms of ROSC (48% vs. 23%; RR =0.72) and survival rate at  both admission (27% vs. 19%; RR =0.85) and discharge (12% vs. 4%; RR =0.90). BVM was  inferior to ETI in terms of ROSC (24% vs. 48%; RR =0.86), survival to admission rate  (21% vs. 27%; RR =1.037), and survival to discharge rate (6% vs. 12%; RR =1.476).  CONCLUSIONS: ETI should be considered for airway management as early as possible,  which can improve the subject's success rate of recovery and survival to admission  rate. In future, large-scale, multi-center, randomized controlled studies should be  conducted to evaluate the exact efficacy of BVM, ETI, and LMA for the first aid of  subjects with OHCA.",NA,"Yang, Zhanzheng Liang, Hengrui Li, Jiaying Qiu, Shuxian He, Zhuosen Li, Jinyin Cao, Zanfeng Yan, Ping Liang, Qing Zeng, Liangbo Liu, Rong Liang, Zijing",Yang Z Liang H Li J Qiu S He Z Li J Cao Z Yan P Liang Q Zeng L Liu R Liang Z,NA,"Department of Emergency Room, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical  University, Guangzhou 510120, China.

Screening for any  type of cancer aims to increase the chances of successful treatment through early  detection of the disease. There were some systematic reviews (SRs) evaluated the  diagnostic value of biomarkers for the diagnosis of PCa and no studies have been  conducted to analyze the quality of these SRs. We are not clear which kind of marker  is the best choice. Thus, this study aims to assess the methodologic quality of the  SRs and reanalyze the published data based on SRs for the biomarkers to find the  optimal biomarker for the early diagnosis of PCa. METHODS: We performed a systematic  literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library and to  identify relevant SRs from inception to April 2019. Diagnostic accuracy studies  included any type of single biomarker or combined biomarkers aimed at evaluating the  diagnostic value is considered eligible for this overview. The Assessment of  Multiple Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) instrument will be used to evaluate the  risk of bias of the included SRs. Standard pairwise meta-analysis and adjusted  indirect comparison will be used to compare the diagnostic value of different  biomarkers. RESULTS: The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed  journal for publication. CONCLUSION: This study will reanalyze the published data  based on SRs. We hope that the results will help find a biomarker with the superior  diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of PCa.

We conducted a systematic review and  assessed the feasibility of an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) to characterize  the comparative efficacy of endocrine-based therapies in this setting. A systematic  literature review (SLR) of Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and key conferences was  performed to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) satisfying the following  criteria: (a) included pre/perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC, (b) included  endocrine-based therapies, (c) reported efficacy, safety, or quality of life  outcomes, and (d) was published in 2007 or later (when HER2 testing was  standardized). The clinical and methodological similarities across trials were  assessed to evaluate the feasibility of an ITC. Four RCTs (PALOMA-3, MONARCH-2, KCSG  BR10-04 and MONALEESA-7) and eight regimens (palbociclib + fulvestrant + goserelin,  fulvestrant + goserelin, abemaciclib + fulvestrant + gonadotropin-releasing hormone  agonist [GnRHa], fulvestrant + GnRHa, anastrozole + goserelin, goserelin,  ribociclib + NSAI/tamoxifen + goserelin and NSAI/tamoxifen + goserelin) were  selected. MONALEESA-7 was the only phase 3 trial investigating endocrine-based  therapies as first-line in only pre/perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC; the  other three trials focused on the ET-failure setting and their pre/perimenopausal  populations were relatively small. ITCs were methodologically unfeasible due to  critical differences in treatment settings and lack of common comparators across  trials. Therefore, we were not able to characterize the relative efficacy of the  different endocrine-based therapies available in the premenopausal HR+/HER2- mBC  setting. This systematic review provides a comprehensive assessment of the available  trial evidence on the efficacy and safety of endocrine-based therapies for  premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC. Only four trials have reported relevant data  in this setting, and MONALEESA-7 is currently the only trial focused on  premenopausal HR+ HER2- mBC in the first-line setting.","© 2019 The Authors.

VBNC pathogens can potentially present a serious risk to human health as  they are invisible to routine microbiological culture-based methods. Of high  importance is the increased tolerance to antibiotics or disinfectant measures while  in the VBNC state. The greatest remaining challenge for such investigations is the  lack of an appropriate, cost-effective multi-species screening method due to  experimental constraints. In this study, we investigated if de novo ATP production  of cells in the VBNC state is a suitable indicator for overall cell viability that  can be utilized to determine the minimum ATP inhibitory concentration (MAIC) of  antibiotics and other antimicrobials. To validate this approach, heat-stress  time-kill experiments were performed with both culturable and VBNC cells. We  developed a comprehensive experimental setup and demonstrated the applicability of  this VBNC-MIC assay for testing the tolerance of 12 strains of 4 important bacterial  species (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria  monocytogenes) in the VBNC state to eight important antimicrobials including four  different antibiotics. We confirmed that bacteria in the VBNC state were resistant  to all tested antibiotics (ampicillin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin) and  additionally insensitive to disinfectants (benzalkonium chloride and  trioctylmethylammonium chloride) and preservatives (bronopol and sodium azide).  These data emphasize the need for further research regarding the characteristics of  bacterial pathogens in the VBNC state and present the advantages and high-throughput  capabilities of ATP determinations to investigate tolerance of VBNC pathogens to  antimicrobials. The presented method should be helpful in order to identify  appropriate countermeasures, treatments, or disinfectants when confronted with  bacterial pathogens in the VBNC state.",NA,"Robben, Christian Witte, Anna Kristina Schoder, Dagmar Stessl, Beatrix Rossmanith, Peter Mester, Patrick",Robben C Witte AK Schoder D Stessl B Rossmanith P Mester P,NA,"Christian Doppler Laboratory for Monitoring of Microbial Contaminants, Department of  Farm Animal and Public Health in Veterinary Medicine, Institute for Milk Hygiene,  Milk Technology and Food Science, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna,  Austria.

The cost  effectiveness of blinatumomab versus inotuzumab has not previously been examined.  METHODS: Cost effectiveness of blinatumomab versus inotuzumab in R/R B-cell  precursor ALL patients with one or no prior salvage therapy from a United States  (US) payer perspective was estimated using a partitioned survival model. Health  outcomes were estimated based on published aggregate data from INO-VATE-ALL and  individual patient data from TOWER weighted to match patients in INO-VATE-ALL using  matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). Analyses were conducted using five  approaches relating to use of anchored versus unanchored comparisons of health  outcomes and, for the anchored comparisons, the reference treatment to which  treatment effects on health outcomes were applied. Estimates from TOWER including  the probabilities of complete remission and allogeneic stem-cell transplant  (allo-SCT), overall and event-free survival, utilities, duration of therapy, and use  of subsequent therapies were MAIC adjusted to match INO-VATE-ALL. Costs of  treatment, adverse events, allo-SCT, subsequent therapies, and terminal care were  from published sources. A 50-year time horizon and 3% annual discount rate were  used. RESULTS: Incremental costs for blinatumomab versus inotuzumab ranged from  US$7023 to US$36,244, depending on the approach used for estimating relative  effectiveness. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) ranged from 0.54 to  1.78. Cost effectiveness for blinatumomab versus inotuzumab ranged from US$4006 to  US$20,737 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Blinatumomab is estimated to be cost  effective versus inotuzumab in R/R B-cell precursor ALL adults who have received one  or no prior salvage therapy from a US payer perspective.",NA,"Delea, Thomas E Zhang, Xinke Amdahl, Jordan Boyko, Diana Dirnberger, Franziska Campioni, Marco Cong, Ze",Delea TE Zhang X Amdahl J Boyko D Dirnberger F Campioni M Cong Z,ORCID: 0000-0001-5493-1925,"Policy Analysis Inc.

It is not known how this strategy compares with initial treatment with a biological.  We therefore compared the effectiveness of tocilizumab (TCZ), or TCZ plus MTX  (TCZ+MTX) with MTX plus 10 mg prednisone (MTX+pred), all initiated within a  treat-to-target treatment strategy in early RA. METHODS: Using individual patient  data of two trials, we indirectly compared tight-controlled treat-to-target  strategies initiating TCZ (n=103), TCZ+MTX (n=106) or MTX+pred (n=117), using  initiation of MTX (n=227) as reference. Primary outcome was Disease Activity Score  assessing 28 joints (DAS28) over 24 months. To assess the influence of acute phase  reactants (APRs), a disease activity composite outcome score without APR (ie,  modification of the Clinical Disease Activity Index (m-CDAI)) was analysed.  Secondary outcomes were remission (several definitions), physical function and  radiographic progression. Multilevel models were used to account for clustering  within trials and patients over time, correcting for relevant confounders. RESULTS:  DAS28 over 24 months was lower for TCZ+MTX than for MTX+Pred (mean difference: -0.62  (95% CI -1.14 to -0.10)). Remission was more often achieved in TCZ+MTX and in TCZ  versus MTX+pred (p=0.02/0.05, respectively). Excluding APRs from the disease  activity outcome score, TCZ-based strategies showed a slightly higher m-CDAI  compared with MTX+pred, but this was not statistically significant. Other outcomes  were also not statistically significantly different between the strategies.  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early RA, although TCZ-based strategies resulted in  better DAS28 and remission rates compared with MTX+pred, at least part of these  effects may be due to a specific effect of TCZ on APRs.",© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Despite improvements in treatment strategies in  recent years, the overall survival rate of CRC is still very low and the survival  rate is highly dependent on the stage at the time of diagnosis. Some biomarkers have  shown great potential for early screening of CRC and some have been tested in  systematic reviews (SRs). However, the quality of these SRs remains unclear and  these SRs did not clarify which biomarker is the optimal diagnostic test. This  overview will evaluate the methodological quality of available SRs and compare the  diagnostic value of different biomarkers in order to find the best biomarker for  diagnosing CRC. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search for SRs published before  February 2019 was conducted in the PubMed, Embase.com, Cochrane Library, and Web of  Science without any language restrictions. We will use the assessment of multiple  systematic reviews-2 instrument to assess the methodological quality of each SR.  Bubble plots will be used to summarize the main characteristics and quality of SRs.  Standard pairwise meta-analysis and adjusted indirect comparison will be conducted  to compare the diagnostic value of different biomarkers. RESULTS: The results of  this overview will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.  CONCLUSION: The findings of this project will provide a general overview and  evidence of the diagnostic value of biomarkers in detecting CRC.

In recent decades, the incidence of MPM has shown an  increasing trend, posing a great threat to human health. Although there is currently  no effective way to treat MPM, patients can survive for more than 5 years if the  tumor is removed early. Several systematic reviews (SRs) have evaluated the  diagnostic value of biomarkers for diagnosing MPM. However, no studies have been  conducted to analyze the quality of these SRs and it remains unclear which biomarker  is the excellent diagnostic test. This study aims to assess the methodological  quality of the SRs and reanalyze the published data based on SRs to find the optimal  biomarker for the early diagnosis of MPM. METHODS: A systematic search will be  performed in PubMed, Embase.com, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, and Web  of Science to identify SRs reporting value of biomarkers for detecting MPM. We will  evaluate the risk of bias of the included SRs according to the Assessment of  Multiple Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) instrument. Standard pairwise meta-analysis  and adjusted indirect comparison will be used to compare the diagnostic value of  different biomarkers.

However, common comparators may not  be available, or the comparison may be biased due to differences in effect modifiers  between the included studies. Recently proposed population adjustment methods aim to  adjust for differences between study populations in the situation where individual  patient data are available from at least one study, but not all studies. They can  also be used when there is no common comparator or for single-arm studies  (unanchored comparisons). We aim to characterise the use of population adjustment  methods in technology appraisals (TAs) submitted to the United Kingdom National  Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). METHODS: We reviewed NICE TAs  published between 01/01/2010 and 20/04/2018. RESULTS: Population adjustment methods  were used in 7 percent (18/268) of TAs. Most applications used unanchored  comparisons (89 percent, 16/18), and were in oncology (83 percent, 15/18). Methods  used included matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (89 percent, 16/18) and  simulated treatment comparisons (17 percent, 3/18). Covariates were included based  on: availability, expert opinion, effective sample size, statistical significance,  or cross-validation. Larger treatment networks were commonplace (56 percent, 10/18),  but current methods cannot account for this. Appraisal committees received results  of population-adjusted analyses with caution and typically looked for greater cost  effectiveness to minimise decision risk. CONCLUSIONS: Population adjustment methods  are becoming increasingly common in NICE TAs, although their impact on decisions has  been limited to date. Further research is needed to improve upon current methods,  and to investigate their properties in simulation studies.",NA,"Phillippo, David M Dias, Sofia Elsada, Ahmed Ades, A E Welton, Nicky J",Phillippo DM Dias S Elsada A Ades AE Welton NJ,ORCID: 0000-0003-2672-7841,"Population Health Sciences,Bristol Medical School,University of  Bristol,Bristol,United Kingdom.

The objective of this  study was to develop a Markov model with a lifetime time horizon to assess the cost  effectiveness of ponatinib for third-line chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia vs.  second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) or  alloHSCT from the public healthcare system perspective in Germany, Sweden, and  Canada. METHODS: Clinical outcomes were derived from the literature, and from  patient-level data (phase II PACE trial) for ponatinib. Resource use included drugs,  alloHSCT, monitoring and follow-up, adverse events, and end-of-life care; costs were  based on national tariffs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using  chronic myeloid leukemia health-state utilities from an international time-trade-off  study. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum for Germany and Sweden,  and 5% for Canada. RESULTS: Ponatinib yielded more discounted QALYs than any  second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor/alloHSCT in all three countries, mainly  owing to better response rates and longer durations of response. Incremental  cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase  inhibitors were US$21,543-37,755/QALY in Germany, $24,018-38,227/QALY in Sweden, and  $43,001-58,515/QALY in Canada. Ponatinib was dominant over alloHSCT in Germany,  while incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. alloHSCT in Sweden and  Canada were $715/QALY and $31,534/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib may  improve outcomes (mainly because of higher response rates and longer response  durations) at an acceptable cost level compared with other third-line treatment  options for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia in Germany, Sweden, and Canada;  however, the lack of an indirect comparison is a limitation of our study.",NA,"Hirt, Carsten Iannazzo, Sergio Chiroli, Silvia McGarry, Lisa J le Coutre, Philipp Stenke, Leif Dahlén, Torsten Lipton, Jeffrey H",Hirt C Iannazzo S Chiroli S McGarry LJ le Coutre P Stenke L Dahlén T Lipton JH,ORCID: 0000-0003-3226-5954,"Department of Internal Medicine C, Hematology and Oncology, Greifswald University  Medical Center, Greifswald, Germany.

However, switchability between generics is unknown, as  direct comparisons between generics are not performed. The aim of this study was to  investigate the bioequivalence between generic clopidogrel products by means of  adjusted indirect comparisons (AICs). METHODS: AICs were conducted to assess  bioequivalence between 4 generic clopidogrel products that are authorised in Serbia.  Generics are considered equivalent to the reference if the 90% confidence intervals  (CIs) for the ratios test/reference of the maximum concentration (C(max) ) and area  under the curve up to the last measurable concentration (AUC(0-t) ) fall within the  acceptance range 80.00-125.00%. However, for AICs between generics, the Canadian  acceptance criterion for C(max) was employed, where only the point estimate of  C(max) needs to be within 80.00-125.00%. RESULTS: The 90% CIs of the AICs  demonstrated bioequivalence within 80.00-125.00% for all AUC(0-t) comparisons. The  point estimates of C(max) in all AICs were also within this range. CONCLUSION: This  study demonstrates that the bioavailability of these 4 generic clopidogrel products  authorised in Serbia is very similar. Despite the limited power of AICs,  bioequivalence was demonstrated for all 90% CIs of AUC(0-t) and all 90% CIs of  C(max) comparisons were within or very close to the acceptance range, being able to  comply with the acceptance criterion employed in Canada for C(max) . Therefore,  these 4 generic clopidogrel products authorised in Serbia can be considered  switchable with each other in clinical practice based on the adjusted indirect  comparisons.",© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.,"Pejčić, Zorica Vučićević, Katarina García-Arieta, Alfredo Miljković, Branislava",Pejčić Z Vučićević K García-Arieta A Miljković B,ORCID: 0000-0001-9676-5785 ORCID: 0000-0002-9702-6973,"Medicines and Medical Devices Agency of Serbia, Belgrade, Republic of Serbia.

Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs),  namely network meta-analysis (NMA), anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison  (MAIC), and simulated treatment comparison (STC), were conducted to compare the  relative efficacy of these therapies. METHODS: Patient-level data from a study that  evaluated InO with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy (INO-VATE-ALL) and published  data from a study that evaluated Blina with SoC chemotherapy (TOWER) were used in  the analyses. Endpoints evaluated included remission rate defined as complete  remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi),  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), overall survival (OS), and  event-free survival (EFS). For each outcome, treatment-effect modifiers were  adjusted for in the anchored MAIC and STC analyses. RESULTS: Analyses showed  statistically significant higher rates of remission and HSCT with InO compared to  Blina irrespective of the ITC method used or measure of the effect (i.e., odds  ratio [OR] or rate difference). The treatment effects derived from the MAIC and STC  analyses were consistent and stronger than those estimated from the NMA. A trend  favoring InO was detected for EFS. The ITC results for OS suggest no difference  between InO and Blina. CONCLUSION: Results from these ITCs indicated a statistically  significant advantage for InO over Blina for rates of remission and HSCT in adults  with relapsed or refractory B cell precursor ALL. It was not possible to fully  adjust for all treatment-effect modifiers, and the similarity in chemotherapy  regimens used in the SoC comparator arms of the INO-VATE-ALL and TOWER studies is  worthy of further exploration. Both studies, however, used chemotherapy regimens  that have a low response rate; therefore, no significant differences in efficacy  outcomes are expected between SoC arms.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: After carrying out a literature search, we performed an  adjusted indirect comparison (Bucher et al.) of the relative efficacy of  enzalutamide and apalutamide in patients with nmCRPC with a high risk of progression  to metastatic disease. The outcomes included were metastasis-free survival (MFS) and  PSA response rate (PSARR). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant  differences between enzalutamide and apalutamide regarding the analysed outcomes.  For the comparison enzalutamide+ADT vs. apalutamide+ADT: MFS a HR (95% CI)=1,036  (0.781-1.373) was obtained. For PSARR, a RR (95% CI)=0.81 (0.339-1.938) was  obtained. CONCLUSIONS: The adjusted indirect comparison performed in this study  shows that there are no statistically significant differences in terms of efficacy  regarding MFS and PSARR between enzalutamide+ADT and apalutamide+ADT in patients  with nmCRPC with a high risk of progression to metastatic disease. However, in order  to confirm these results, an independent trial with direct comparison between both  drugs would be required.","Copyright © 2019 AEU. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.

Recently, randomized controlled trials have  examined the benefit of apalutamide and enzalutamide in these patients. We sought to  perform an indirect treatment comparison using a network meta-analysis approach to  compare the relative efficacy and toxicity of these two agents. The primary outcome  of this analysis was metastasis-free survival (MFS) while secondary outcomes were  time to prostate-specific antigen progression, overall survival, and adverse events.  The Bucher technique for indirect comparison was used to compare apalutamide and  enzalutamide using the common placebo comparator. We found no evidence of a  significant difference in MFS (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.37)  between enzalutamide and apalutamide. Similarly, there were no differences for any  of the secondary outcomes. While indirect comparisons cannot supplant direct  comparative data, this analysis suggests that apalutamide and enzalutamide are  similarly effective in delaying metastases for patients with nmCRPC. PATIENT  SUMMARY: Historically, there have been few treatment options for prostate cancer  patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy who have rising prostate-specific  antigen levels without obvious recurrence of cancer. Recent randomized controlled  trials demonstrated that treatment with enzalutamide and apalutamide delayed the  development of metastatic cancer. This study demonstrates through an indirect  comparison that both medications are likely to have similar efficacy and side-effect  profiles.",Copyright © 2018 European Association of Urology.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a scoping review using a list of NMAs which  incorporated NRE that were identified from a previous review. All NMAs that included  NRE in the analysis of main outcomes or sensitivity analyses were eligible for  inclusion. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion and performed  data abstraction. Data analysis involved quantitative (frequencies and percentages)  and qualitative (narrative synthesis) methods. RESULTS: A total of 23 NMAs met the  predefined inclusion criteria, of which 74% (n = 17) used naïve pooling, 0% used NRE  as informative priors, 9% (n = 2) used the 3-level Bayesian hierarchical model, 9%  (n = 2) used all methods, and 9% (n = 2) used other methods. Most NMAs were  supplemented with additional analyses to investigate the effect estimates when only  randomized evidence was included. CONCLUSION: Although most studies provided  justification for the inclusion of NRE, transparent reporting of the method used to  combine randomized evidence and NRE was unclear in most published networks. Most  NMAs used naïve pooling for combining randomized evidence and NRE.",Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The prognosis of ovarian  cancer is poor because it is prone to early metastasis during progression.  Therefore, early diagnosis of ovarian cancer is very important. Some systematic  reviews have evaluated the diagnostic value of different biomarkers for ovarian  cancer. However, there is no consensus in the conclusions, and some are even  contradictory. This study aims to assess the methodological and reporting quality of  available systematic reviews and to find an optimal biomarker for diagnosing ovarian  cancer. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase.com, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews,  and Web of Science were searched to identify relevant systematic reviews from  inception to February 2019. We included systematic reviews that include randomized  controlled trials, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, or cohort studies  as long as the systematic reviews evaluated the diagnostic performance of biomarkers  for ovarian cancer. The methodological quality will be assessed using assessment of  multiple systematic reviews-2 checklist, and the reporting quality will be assessed  using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis diagnostic  test accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) checklist. The pairwise meta-analysis and indirect  comparisons will be performed using STATA (13.0; Stata Corporation, College Station,  TX). RESULTS: The results of this overview will be submitted to a peer-reviewed  journal for publication. CONCLUSION: This overview will provide comprehensive  evidence of different biomarkers for diagnosing ovarian cancer.

In  standard NMA, all existing (single or combined) treatments are different nodes in  the network. However, sometimes an alternative model is of interest that utilizes  the information that some treatments are combinations of common components, called  component network meta-analysis (CNMA) model. The additive CNMA model assumes that  the effect of a treatment combined of two components A and B is the sum of the  effects of A and B, which is easily extended to treatments composed of more than two  components. This implies that in comparisons equal components cancel out.  Interaction CNMA models also allow interactions between the components. Bayesian  analyses have been suggested. We report an implementation of CNMA models in the  frequentist R package netmeta. All parameters are estimated using weighted least  squares regression. We illustrate the application of CNMA models using an NMA of  treatments for depression in primary care. Moreover, we show that these models can  even be applied to disconnected networks, if the composite treatments in the  subnetworks contain common components.","© 2019 The Authors.

Main subgroup  analyses were conducted according to PD-L1 expression. A total of 11 RCTs involving  6,731 patients were included. Overall, PD-1/L1 inhibitors showed no difference to  chemotherapy in PFS (HR 0.90, 0.65-1.24) and OS (HR 0.84, 0.64-1.09), while I + C  was superior to chemotherapy both in PFS (HR 0.64, 0.58-0.71) and OS (HR 0.74,  0.62-0.89). I + C also showed advantages over PD-1/L1 in PFS (HR 0.71, 0.51-0.99)  but not OS (HR 0.88, 0.64-1.22).

DATA SOURCES: We conducted a systematic search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane  Library, and China Biomedical Literature to identify relevant studies from the first  day of databases to August 2018. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Two independent  reviewers screened for study eligibility and extracted data. Random controlled  trials, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, and cohort studies evaluating  the diagnostic accuracy of hormonal markers for endometriosis were included.  TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: We included 17 studies that involved 1279  participants and evaluated 7 hormonal biomarkers. The pooled sensitivity and  specificity in endometriosis were .79 (.71, .86) and .89 (.82, .94) for aromatase,  .30 (.18, .46) and .80 (.65, .90) for human chorionic gonadotropin/luteinizing  hormone receptor, .75 (.66, .83) and .47 (.34, .60) for estrogen receptor (ER)-α,  .65 (.56, .74) and .68 (.55, .80) for ER-β, .45 (.38-.52) and .92 (.85-.97) for  serum prolactin, .69 (.51, .83) and .30 (.16, .49) for estrogen sulfotransferase,  and .73 (.60-.84) and .48 (.33-.63) for 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2  (17βHSD2). Compared with human chorionic gonadotropin/luteinizing hormone receptor,  ER-α, ER-β, estrogen sulfotransferase, and 17βHSD2, aromatase had a higher  sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio. The  specificities of aromatase and serum prolactin were comparable, but the sensitivity,  positive likelihood ratio, and positive likelihood ratio of serum prolactin were  much lower than that of aromatase. CONCLUSION: Aromatase may be an excellent  diagnostic test for endometriosis. However, because of the moderate quality of the  included studies and the limited sample size, this result requires more research to  validate.

These hamper the use of standard network  meta-analyses for indirect treatment comparison of relative efficacy. In this  situation, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) in second-line CP-CML was  performed. The aim was to compare the relative efficacies of bosutinib, dasatinib  and nilotinib in second-line CP-CML patients.Methods: The MAIC was preceded by a  systematic literature review that ensured inclusion of the underlying data for the  analyses. The outcomes were measured in terms of overall survival (OS),  progression-free survival (PFS) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR). The  treatments were quantitatively compared based on Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR)  regressions, on restricted mean survival (RMST, when the proportionality assumption  showed evidence of violation) and on odds ratios (for response measures).Results:  Comparing with dasatinib, bosutinib resulted in HRs for PFS and OS of 0.63  (0.44-0.90, p < .05) and 0.82 (0.54-1.26, p = .37) respectively, and resulted in an  OR for MCyR of 0.78 (0.53-1.16). Although the proportionality of hazards assumption  was violated for PFS, the RMST analyses confirmed the findings of the Cox  regression. When compared with nilotinib, bosutinib showed a significant HR of 0.54  (0.38-0.76, p < .01) in favor of bosutinib for PFS, a non-significant HR of 0.72  (0.46-1.13, p = .16) for OS and a non-significant OR of 0.98 (0.71-1.35) for  MCyR.Conclusions: Bosutinib had a significantly greater PFS than both dasatinib and  nilotinib. For OS, the findings were numerically in favor of bosutinib, but not  statistically significant. For MCyR, the findings were numerically in favor of  dasatinib and nilotinib, but not statistically significant.",NA,"Cortes, Jorge E Muresan, Bogdan Mamolo, Carla Cappelleri, Joseph C Crescenzo, Rocco J Su, Yun Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo Heeg, Bart Douglas Smith, B",Cortes JE Muresan B Mamolo C Cappelleri JC Crescenzo RJ Su Y Gambacorti-Passerini C Heeg B Douglas Smith B,ORCID: 0000-0001-5321-561X,"Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

METHODS: Twenty-one double-blind randomised controlled trials of  patients with advanced PD with motor fluctuations receiving L-dopa comparing  ropinirole or pramipexole with comparators were identified from 2550 publications.  Bayesian indirect comparison methods were applied to independently review efficacy  outcomes including off-time reduction, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating  Scale-Activity of Daily Living (UPDRS-ADL) and UPDRS-motor scores, and safety  outcomes including adverse events (AE) and patient withdrawals, to determine  indirect treatment comparison mean differences (MD) or hazard ratios (HR) with 95%  confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The indirect efficacy comparison resulted in a  statistically nonsignificant off-time reduction difference (hours) of  ropinirole-sustained release (SR) versus pramipexole-immediate release (MD - 0.25;  95% CI - 0.71, 0.21) and ropinirole-SR versus pramipexole-extended release (ER) (MD  0.18; 95% CI - 0.40, 0.76). Ropinirole-SR adjunctive treatment showed a tendency  towards more improvement in UPDRS-ADL score (MD 1.24; 95% CI 0.23, 2.24) than  adjunctive treatment of pramipexole-ER. Pramipexole-ER may be less likely to induce  somnolence as an AE compared with ropinirole-SR (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23, 0.89).  However, there were no statistically significant differences in UPDRS-motor score  reduction, incidence of dyskinesia, hallucination, hypotension, insomnia and nausea,  or withdrawals due to AE, for any reason. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive therapy with  ropinirole-SR or pramipexole appears to offer similar efficacy and tolerability in  patients with advanced PD on the basis of this indirect comparison.

341,35157413,NA,Publisher,NA,NA,2019 Apr,NA,NA,"The type of care a preterm baby receives within the first few hours of life can have  a significant impact on their long-term outcome. The phrase “golden hour,” first  used in trauma patients, has been adopted to refer to neonatal care at this crucial  time. Early delivery room respiratory support in preterm infants has been  extensively investigated and may make a significant contribution to reducing the  risk of long-term lung damage, other morbidities and even death. One of the  difficult choices in the current era is to determine whether or not to intubate a  preterm baby in order to give surfactant very soon after birth. Many babies can be  supported by non-invasive methods of delivering oxygen, such as continuous positive  airways pressure (CPAP), which avoid intubation. There is evidence that surfactant  can be administered to these non-intubated babies using less invasive administration  techniques that may reduce the risk of morbidity associated with intubation. At  present it is not clear which is the best strategy. This review aims to explore  which delivery room respiratory support techniques are likely to give optimal  disease-free survival in preterm infants. We have compared early invasive intubation  and surfactant administration techniques, with less invasive surfactant  administration techniques and non-invasive respiratory support techniques.  Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm babies is caused by a deficiency of  lung surfactant. The risk of RDS increases with decreasing gestational age, and is  almost inevitable in babies born at less than 28 weeks gestation. Without surfactant  the lungs become stiff and the alveoli collapse at end-expiration, and untreated RDS  is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Surfactant is a  naturally produced surface-active lipoprotein complex mixed with proteins, which  reduces the surface tension at the alveolar liquid surface. Surfactant allows  alveoli to stay open in expiration and substantially reduces the work of breathing.  It also reduces shearing forces on immature alveolar membrane, preventing membrane  rupture and protein leak into the alveolar space with resulting lung damage. RDS in  preterm babies can be prevented by administration of exogenous animal derived  surfactant therapy, and this substantially reduces mortality and respiratory  morbidity for this population, including improved survival without bronchopulmonary  dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days. However, the optimal dose (including the use of single  or multiple administration) and mode of administration of surfactant remains  controversial and may make a significant contribution to the chances of long term  lung damage, other morbidities or death. The various techniques of administration  can be grouped into three categories: conventional endotracheal intubation (where  the baby is intubated, surfactant is administered and the baby then continues on  mechanical ventilation); endotracheal intubation and surfactant administration  followed by immediate extubation (also called Intubate, Surfactant, Rapid  Extubation, and known as InSuRE or ISX); surfactant administration without  endotracheal intubation via a thin endotracheal catheter during spontaneous  breathing or with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) (known as Minimally  Invasive Surfactant Therapy, MIST or Less Invasive Surfactant Administration, LISA,  or Avoidance of Mechanical Ventilation, AMV). This review aims to explore which  administration technique and dosing regimen is likely to give optimal outcomes in  preterm infants. Low flow oxygen is frequently used in neonatal units, as an  integral part of respiratory support in preterm babies. The goal of oxygen therapy  is to achieve adequate delivery of oxygen to the tissues without causing oxygen  toxicity. In addition to delivering oxygen via a ventilator or CPAP circuit, there  are several different methods of low-flow oxygen administration: head box oxygen,  incubator, facemask, nasal prongs, nasal cannula and nasopharyngeal catheter. Oxygen  can be delivered humidified or non-humidified, and the method of titration can be  automated or manual. It is important to know, the efficacy, potential risks, and the  impact on lung function of the different methods when used in preterm babies. The  aim of this review is to determine the optimal type of oxygen delivered, method of  administration and method of titration in preterm babies requiring respiratory  support. The lungs of preterm babies are structurally immature, deficient of  surfactant and not supported by a rigid chest wall. They are therefore highly  susceptible to injury from the different types of respiratory support available for  use in this population. Whereas pressure support ventilation (PSV) and continuous  positive airway pressure (CPAP) have been used in neonatology for many years, newer  modes of ventilation such as volume targeted ventilation (VTV) and, more recently,  heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) have become popular. This review  will look at the evidence available to assess the effectiveness of the different  types of assisted ventilation techniques in preterm babies. Inhaled nitric oxide is  a potent, selective pulmonary vasodilator. It has a clearly defined role in the  management of pulmonary hypertension in term babies, where it has been shown to  improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.  However, its role in preterm babies requiring invasive respiratory support is less  well defined. Recently, a number of studies have been published looking at the  effect of inhaled nitric oxide on the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)  in preterm babies and its potential role in hypoxic respiratory failure. This review  aims to determine the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide in preterm babies  requiring invasive ventilation, both in hypoxic respiratory failure and in the  prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia In the NMA for the outcome of mortality  prior to discharge and BPD at 36 weeks PMA there was no evidence to suggest a  difference between between CPAP, NIPPV, BiPAP/SiPAP, or Hi Flow. Similarly, pairwise  analyses did not identify any meaningful differences between non-invasive  ventilation techniques. The committee acknowledged two existing non-UK economic  evaluations comparing CPAP with NIPPV and Hi Flow, respectively. However, these  analyses did not include all non-invasive ventilation techniques of interest. Given  the lack of differences in the clinical effectiveness between non-invasive  ventilation techniques and the lack of existing economic evidence the committee  considered it important to compare the costs of the techniques to aid considerations  of cost effectiveness. Generally the NHS Reference Costs (DHSC, 2018) is the  recommended source of unit cost data that should be used to aid considerations of  cost effectiveness. However, the committee explained that the neonatal activity  payments are based on the level of activity (that is, intensive care, high  dependency and special care) rather than procedures. As a result, costings of  non-invasive ventilation techniques were undertaken to aid considerations of cost  effectiveness and included equipment acquisition costs, maintenanece costs and  consumable costs. The results of conventional pairwise meta-analyses of direct  evidence alone do not help to fully inform which invasive and non-invasive  ventilation technique is most effective in preterm babies requiring respiratory  support. Each pairwise comparison does not fully inform the choice between the  different treatments and having a series of discrete pairwise comparisons can be  incoherent and difficult to interpret. In addition, direct comparisons of treatments  of clinical interest are not fully available, for all comparisons. To overcome these  issues, a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed. Advantages of  performing this type of analysis are as follows. It allows the synthesis of evidence  on multiple treatments compared directly and indirectly without breaking  randomisation. If treatment A has never been compared to treatment B in a head to  head trial, but these two interventions have been compared to a common comparator,  then an indirect treatment comparison can be derived using the relative effects of  the two treatments versus the common comparator. Indirect estimates can be  calculated whenever there is a path linking two treatments through a set of common  comparators. All the randomised evidence is considered simultaneously within the  same model. For every intervention in a connected network, a relative effect  estimate (with its 95% credible intervals, CrIs) between any two interventions can  be estimated. These estimates provide a useful clinical summary of the results and  facilitate the formation of recommendations based on all relevant evidence, whilst  appropriately accounting for uncertainty. Ranks of interventions may also be  calculated. Estimates from the NMA can be used to directly parameterise treatment  effectiveness in cost-effectiveness modelling of multiple treatments. Conventional  fixed effect meta-analysis assumes that the relative effect of one treatment  compared to another is the same across an entire set of trials. In a random effects  model, it is assumed that the relative effects are different in each trial but that  they are from a single common distribution and that this distribution is common  across all sets of trials. NMA requires an additional assumption over conventional  meta-analysis. The additional assumption is that intervention A has the same effect  on people in trials of intervention A compared to intervention B as it does for  people in trials of intervention A versus intervention C and so on. Thus, in an NMA,  the assumption is that intervention A has the same effect across trials of A versus  B, A versus C and so on. The terms indirect treatment comparisons, mixed treatment  comparisons and NMA are used interchangeably. We use the term NMA as the network  consists of both indirect treatment comparisons (some trials have a common  comparator and some do not) and mixed treatment comparisons (with at least one  closed loop, combination of direct and indirect evidence). The purpose of this  analysis was to assess the consistency assumption in the network meta-analysis (NMA)  model used to estimate the comparative effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation  techniques in specialist neonatal respiratory care (SNRC) for babies born preterm.  The outcomes included in this analysis were 1) mortality prior to discharge and 2)  bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA).

This overview aimed to assess the methodological and reporting quality  of systematic reviews that evaluated the diagnostic value of imaging modalities for  lymph node involvement in patients with rectal cancer and to compare the diagnostic  value of different modalities for lymph node involvement. The PubMed, EMBASE,  Cochrane Library and Chinese Biomedicine Literature were searched to identify  relevant systematic reviews. The methodological quality was assessed using the  AMSTAR checklist, and the reporting quality was assessed using PRISMA-DTA checklist.  The indirect comparison was conducted to compare the accuracy of different imaging  modalities. Seven systematic reviews involving 353 primary studies were included.  The median (Range) AMSTAR scores were 6.0 (4.0-9.0); the median (Range) PRISMA-DTA  scores were 18.0 (11.0-23.0).

In the absence of a head-to-head comparative study of the two  treatment modalities, an indirect comparison of data from 2 independent but similar  clinical trials was undertaken. METHODS: Two similar randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled, crossover studies were identified which evaluated either  C1-INH(SC) (COMPACT; NCT01912456; 16 weeks) or C1-INH(IV) (CHANGE; NCT01005888;  14 weeks) vs. placebo (on-demand treatment only) for routine prevention of HAE  attacks. Individual patient data from each trial were used to conduct an indirect  comparison of treatment effects. Attack reductions (absolute and percent of  mean/median number of monthly HAE attacks reduction over placebo) were compared  between the two C1-INH formulations at approved/recommended doses: C1-INH(SC)  60 IU/kg twice weekly (n = 45) and 1000 U of C1-INH(IV) twice weekly (n = 22). Point  estimates were adjusted using mixed and quantile regression models that controlled  for study design. RESULTS: The absolute mean monthly numbers of HAE attack  reductions were 3.6 (95% CI 2.9, 4.2) for C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg vs. placebo and 2.3  (1.4, 3.3) for C1-INH(IV) vs. placebo; between-product difference, 1.3 (0.1, 2.4;  P = 0.034). The mean percent reduction in monthly attack rate was significantly  greater with C1-INH(SC) as compared with C1-INH(IV) (84% vs. 51%; P < 0.001). The  percentages of subjects experiencing ≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, and ≥ 90% reductions in monthly  HAE attack rates versus placebo were significantly higher with C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg  as compared to C1-INH(IV) 1000 U (≥ 50% reduction: 91% vs. 50%, odds ratio  [OR] = 10.33, P = 0.003; ≥ 70% reduction: 84% vs. 46%, OR = 6.19, P = 0.005; ≥ 90%  reduction: 57% vs. 18%, OR = 6.04, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of  an indirect study comparison, this analysis suggests greater attack reduction with  twice-weekly C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg as compared to twice-weekly C1-INH(IV) 1000 U for  the routine prevention of HAE attacks.",NA,"Bernstein, Jonathan A Li, Huamin Henry Craig, Timothy J Manning, Michael E Lawo, John-Philip Machnig, Thomas Krishnarajah, Girishanthy Fridman, Moshe",Bernstein JA Li HH Craig TJ Manning ME Lawo JP Machnig T Krishnarajah G Fridman M,NA,"1University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Bernstein Clinical Research  Center, 231 Albert Sabin Way ML #563, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0563 USA.

Clinical trials  for SMA type 1 therapies, onasemnogene abeparvovec (AVXS-101) and nusinersen,  demonstrated meaningful improvements in efficacy (e.g., overall survival) but there  were no head-to-head clinical trials assessing comparative efficacy. This study  estimated the treatment effects of AVXS-101 relative to nusinersen for the treatment  of SMA type 1. METHODS: Overall survival, event-free survival (no death or need to  use permanent assisted ventilation), improvement in motor function [increase of ≥ 4  points in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders  (CHOP-INTEND) score from baseline], and motor milestone achievements (head control,  rolling over, and sitting unassisted) reported in the onasemnogene abeparvovec  (AVXS-101-CL-101; NCT02122952) and nusinersen (ENDEAR; NCT02193074) clinical trials  were indirectly compared using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. RESULTS: Among  symptomatic infants with SMA type 1, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one  more death with AVXS-101 instead of nusinersen was 6.2 [95% confidence intervals  (CI) = 4.1-12.2], and the probability of preventing death was 20% higher for  patients treated with AVXS-101 than nusinersen [risk ratio (RR) = 1.2, 95%  CI 1.1-1.3]. For event-free survival, the NNT to prevent one more event was 2.6 (95%  CI 2.0-3.6) and RR was 1.6 (95% CI 1.4-1.9). For improvement in motor function, NNT  was 3.5 (95% CI 2.6-5.3) and RR was 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.6). For milestone  achievements, the NNTs were 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.9), 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.5), and 1.2 (95%  CI 1.0-1.5); RRs 4.2 (95% CI 2.6-6.7), 7.8 (95% CI 3.6-17.0), and 11.2 (95%  CI 5.1-24.5) for head control, rolling over, and sitting unassisted, respectively.  Results were similar using the Bayesian approach. CONCLUSION: This indirect  comparison (AVXS-101-CL-101 vs. ENDEAR) among symptomatic SMA type 1 infants  suggests that AVXS-101 may have an efficacy advantage relative to nusinersen for  overall survival, independence from permanent assisted ventilation, motor function,  and motor milestones.

METHODS: A systematic literature review and network  meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted on 24-week efficacy outcomes: Health Assessment  Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score, American College of Rheumatology  (ACR) 20/50/70 criteria, and European League Against Rheumatism Disease Activity  Score 28-joint count erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28) < 2.6. In addition,  serious infections and serious adverse events (SI/SAE) were examined at 24 weeks.  RESULTS: Nine trials were selected for the NMA. Sarilumab 200 mg showed superiority  versus adalimumab monotherapy on all efficacy outcomes and versus tofacitinib  monotherapy on ACR20. Compared with csDMARDs, sarilumab 200 mg showed superiority on  ACR 20/50/70 criteria and DAS28 < 2.6 but had similar efficacy on HAQ-DI. Efficacy  of sarilumab 200 mg was similar versus certolizumab, etanercept, tofacitinib and  tocilizumab 8 mg/kg monotherapy across all efficacy outcomes. SI/SAE appeared  similar for sarilumab 200 mg versus all comparators. CONCLUSION: In csDMARD-IR  patients, sarilumab 200 mg monotherapy has superior efficacy and similar safety  versus csDMARDs, superior efficacy and similar safety versus adalimumab, and similar  efficacy and safety versus bDMARDs and tsDMARDs.

METHODS: Using EVE alone as the  common comparator, the Bucher method for ITC compared LEN + EVE with cabozantinib  (CAB), nivolumab (NIV), placebo (PBO) and axitinib (AXI). Hazard ratios (HR) for  overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) estimated the impact of  applying three versions of the LEN+EVE trial data in separate ITCs. Last, to  overcome exchangeability bias and potential violations to the proportional hazards  assumption, a network meta-analysis using fractional polynomials was performed.  RESULTS: Bucher ITCs demonstrated LEN + EVE superiority over EVE for PFS, indirect  superiority to NIV, AXI, and PBO, and no difference to CAB. For OS, LEN + EVE was  superior to EVE and indirectly superior to PBO, applying original HOPE 205 data.  Using European Medicines Agency data, LEN + EVE was directly superior to EVE for OS.  Fractional polynomial HRs for PFS and OS substantially overlapped with Bucher  estimates, demonstrating LEN+EVE superiority over EVE, alone, NIV, and CAB. However,  there were no statistically significant results as the credible intervals for HR  crossed 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing three Bucher ITCs, LEN + EVE demonstrated  superior PFS when indirectly compared to NIV, AXI, and PBO, and mixed results for  OS. While fractional polynomial modelling for PFS and OS failed to find  statistically significant differences in LEN + EVE efficacy, the overall HR trends  were comparable.",NA,"Tremblay, Gabriel McElroy, Heather J Westley, Tracy Meier, Genevieve Misurski, Derek Guo, Matthew",Tremblay G McElroy HJ Westley T Meier G Misurski D Guo M,ORCID: 0000-0001-9001-3128,"Department of Health Economics, Purple Squirrel Economics, New York, New York,  United States of America.

Additionally, to determine the feasibility of conducting a  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to validate the meta-regression  results. Methods: A published systematic literature review (SLR) identified studies  evaluating the efficacy of cladribine tablets and alternative DMTs in the management  of active RRMS. A series of meta-regression models were run with adjustment for  baseline risk, fitted to data from the intention-to-treat cohorts of trials  identified in the SLR. A non-parametric MAIC analysis adjusted for differences  between studies by reweighting patient-level data from the index trial to match the  mean baseline characteristics reported for trials with only aggregate data. Results:  The meta-regression analysis showed significant overlap in credible intervals for  the hazard ratios of 6 month confirmed disability progression (CDP-6M) and  annualized relapse rate (ARR), with no therapy statistically dominating in terms of  efficacy and all therapies estimated to reduce the ARR compared to placebo in all  subpopulations. In the MAIC analysis, cladribine tablets showed a reduction in  CDP-6M and ARR comparable to alemtuzumab before and after matching. Conclusion: This  analysis has demonstrated that cladribine tablets have comparable relative efficacy  to other highly efficacious DMTs in active RRMS across all subpopulations, thus  validating the comparative effectiveness results from previous network  meta-analysis. The MAIC analysis showed that cladribine tablets are comparable in  efficacy to alemtuzumab in the treatment of patients with RRMS.",NA,"Berardi, Andrea Siddiqui, Mohd Kashif Treharne, Catrin Harty, Gerard Wong, Schiffon L",Berardi A Siddiqui MK Treharne C Harty G Wong SL,NA,"a Parexel International , London , UK. b Parexel International, Mohali , Punjab , India. a Parexel International , London , UK. c EMD Serono Research and Development , Billerica , USA. c EMD Serono Research and Development , Billerica , USA.",eng,NA,"Journal Article Meta-Analysis Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Systematic Review",20190329,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,NOTNLM,*Relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis *cladribine *disease modifying therapy *indirect treatment comparison *matching-adjusted indirect comparison *meta-regression,2019/02/23 06:00,2020/06/10 06:00,2019/02/22 06:00,2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed] 2020/06/10 06:00 [medline] 2019/02/22 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/03007995.2019.1585779 [doi],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2019 Aug;35(8):1371-1378. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2019.1585779.

METHODS: Patient-level data from  the Phase 3 blinatumomab trial TOWER and published aggregated data from the Phase 3  InO trial INO-VATE-ALL were used to conduct matching-adjusted indirect comparisons.  Patients with 2+ prior salvage therapies from TOWER were excluded because such  patients were not included in INO-VATE-ALL. To ensure balance in the remaining  patients, baseline characteristics for the TOWER patients were weighted to match the  average baseline characteristics in INO-VATE-ALL, including sex, age, race,  performance status, bone marrow blast, previous salvage therapy, previous allogeneic  transplantation, complete remission with complete hematologic recovery (CR) to most  recent induction therapy, and duration of first remission. Overall survival (OS),  including median and restricted mean survival time (RMST) at 12 and 20.7 months, and  CR were estimated and compared. RESULTS: A total of 310 patients in TOWER were  included (blinatumomab, n = 203; standard of care chemotherapy, n = 107). After  matching the listed baseline characteristics, the median OS was 9.3 months for  blinatumomab and 7.7 months for InO (weighted log-rank test p = 0.4). The relative  RMST at 12 months was 1.6 months longer for blinatumomab than for InO [95% CI (0.1,  3.2); p = 0.04]; at 20.7 months the RMST was not significantly different. The CR  rates were similar [anchor-based difference = - 2.8%, 95% CI (- 17.5%, 11.9%);  p = 0.71]. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for cross-trial differences, blinatumomab  demonstrated a similar CR rate and potential OS benefit versus InO among adult  patients with R/R ALL who received no more than one prior salvage therapy. Further  studies are suggested to confirm this finding.

The cost-effectiveness versus relevant comparator was assessed to  support evidence-based decision making. Methods: A four health states Markov model  was built: first, second line treatments, BSC and death. Benefits were measured in  QALYs, and efficacy estimates were obtained from an indirect treatment comparison. A  10-year time horizon and a 3% undifferentiated discount rate were considered.  Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The  costs of treating MRCC with Sunitinib were higher than Pazopanib and BSC. When  comparing Sunitinib versus Pazopanib, the incremental benefit is small favoring  Sunitinib (0.03 QALYs). The base case scenario shows an average ICER of PA versus  BSC of US$62,327.11/QALY and of US$85,885/QALY for Sunitinib versus Pazopanib. The  ICER was most sensitive to the OS relative to BSC, where evidence was associated to  important bias. Conclusions: Sunitinib or Pazopanib can be considered cost-effective  if a 3 GDP per-capita threshold is assumed. The decision between SU or PA is highly  sensitive to the price of the drugs, rather than the outcomes. Therefore, the  decision might be made based on cost-minimization exercise.",NA,"Vargas, C Balmaceda, C Rodríguez, F Rojas, R Giglio, A Espinoza, M A",Vargas C Balmaceda C Rodríguez F Rojas R Giglio A Espinoza MA,ORCID: 0000-0002-8667-1926,"Unidad de Evaluación de Tecnologías en Salud, Centro de Investigación Clínica,  Faculty of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile , Santiago , Chile.

METHODS:  Vedolizumab is a gut-selective medication for moderate to severe UC. Since no  comparative trials are available for direct comparison of vedolizumab vs adalimumab  in UC, a systematic review of literature databases was conducted to identify  randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the two drugs in patients with moderate to  severe UC after failure of conventional treatment. Studies were screened for  eligibility by two reviewers based on predefined inclusion criteria. Bucher's  adjusted indirect comparison was used to compare vedolizumab and adalimumab  indirectly through placebo as common comparator. RESULTS: One vedolizumab study  (GEMINI 1) and three adalimumab studies (ULTRA 1, ULTRA 2 and M10-447) met the  eligibility criteria. Baseline characteristics of the included populations were  similar in biologic-naïve UC patients across study arms. Although no statistically  significant differences between treatments were found for induction efficacy  endpoints, there was a trend toward a benefit of vedolizumab over adalimumab. There  were also no significant differences between treatments for any maintenance efficacy  endpoints, with no clear trend favoring either agent. Vedolizumab exhibited  statistically superior maintenance safety compared with adalimumab, with significant  reductions in risks of adverse events (relative risk 0.67 [95% confidence interval  0.57-0.80]; p < .0001), serious adverse events (0.20 [0.09-0.42]; p < .0001) and  adverse events leading to discontinuation (0.14 [0.05-0.43]; p = .0006).

This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to  assess the comparative efficacy of ustekinumab, adalimumab, vedolizumab and  infliximab in the maintenance of clinical response and remission after 1 year of  treatment. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify  relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Key outcomes of interest were clinical  response (CD activity index [CDAI] reduction of 100 points; CDAI-100) and remission  (CDAI score under 150 points; CDAI < 150). A treatment sequence Bayesian NMA was  conducted to account for the re-randomization of patients based on different  clinical definitions, the lack of similarity of the common comparator for each trial  and the full treatment pathway from the induction phase onwards. RESULTS: Thirteen  RCTs were identified. Ustekinumab 90 mg q8w was associated with statistically  significant improvement in clinical response relative to placebo and vedolizumab  300 mg. For clinical remission, ustekinumab 90 mg q8w was associated with  statistically significant improvement relative to placebo and vedolizumab 300 mg  q8w. Findings from sub-population analyses had similar results but were not  statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The NMA suggest that ustekinumab is  associated with the highest likelihood of reaching response or remission at 1 year  compared with placebo, adalimumab and vedolizumab. Results should be interpreted  with caution because this is a novel methodology; however, the treatment sequence  analysis may be the most methodologically sound analysis to derive estimates of  comparative efficacy in CD in the absence of head-to-head evidence.",NA,"Varu, Abhishek Wilson, Florence R Dyrda, Peter Hazel, Maureen Hutton, Brian Cameron, Chris",Varu A Wilson FR Dyrda P Hazel M Hutton B Cameron C,NA,"a Evidence Synthesis , Cornerstone Research Group , Burlington , Ontario , Canada. a Evidence Synthesis , Cornerstone Research Group , Burlington , Ontario , Canada. b Janssen Inc., Janssen Canada , Toronto , Ontario , Canada. b Janssen Inc., Janssen Canada , Toronto , Ontario , Canada. a Evidence Synthesis , Cornerstone Research Group , Burlington , Ontario , Canada. c Research , Ottawa Hospital Research Institute , Ottawa , Ontario , Canada. d Public Health and Preventative Medicine , University of Ottawa School of  Epidemiology , Ottawa , Ontario , Canada. a Evidence Synthesis , Cornerstone Research Group , Burlington , Ontario , Canada.",eng,NA,"Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20190320,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,NOTNLM,*Crohn’s disease *Network meta-analysis *adaptive trial design *biologics *indirect treatment comparisons *study design *ustekinumab,2019/02/08 06:00,2020/03/25 06:00,2019/02/08 06:00,2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed] 2020/03/25 06:00 [medline] 2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/03007995.2019.1580094 [doi],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2019 May;35(5):733-756. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2019.1580094.

Novel therapies, such as fixed-ratio  combinations of basal insulin plus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, may  contribute to better glycemic control. In the analysis presented here, the present  analysis assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness of two fixed-ratio combinations,  IDegLira (insulin degludec/liraglutide) and iGlarLixi (insulin  glargine/lixisenatide), for the treatment of patients with T2DM inadequately  controlled with basal insulin from a healthcare payer perspective in the Czech  Republic. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed over patient  lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Treatment effects were obtained from  an indirect treatment comparison as no head-to-head data for IDegLira versus  iGlarLixi are currently available. IDegLira was compared with two iGlarLixi pens  (100 U/mL insulin glargine + 33 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL of lixisenatide, respectively).  Direct medical costs associated with pharmaceutical interventions, screening and  diabetes-related complications were captured. Deterministic and probabilistic  sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with gains in  life expectancy of 0.11 years and in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.14  quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) versus iGlarLixi, due to a lower cumulative  incidence and delayed onset of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was also  associated with higher projected costs due to higher acquisition costs; however,  these were partially offset by cost savings from avoided complications. IDegLira was  associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Czech Koruna (CZK) 695,998  and CZK 348,323 per QALY gained versus iGlarLixi pens containing 33 and 50 μg/mL of  lixisenatide, respectively. These ratios were below the commonly used  willingness-to-pay threshold of CZK 1,200,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: The  present analysis indicated that IDegLira was associated with clinical benefits  relative to iGlarLixi over patient lifetimes and was likely to be cost-effective in  the treatment of patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin in the Czech  Republic.

We illustrate with motivating  examples two methods for the creation of historical controls where disease  progression and overall survival are typically the key clinically meaningful  endpoints. The first method utilises information routinely collected in a clinical  trial programme: patients' time to disease progression on their previous line of  treatment against which outcomes can be compared.

The present study compared  the efficacy of two IV iron formulations in patients with IDA: iron isomaltoside  (IIM) and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). METHODS: A systematic literature review (SLR)  was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IIM and FCM in  patients with IDA. An adjusted indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of IIM and FCM  was then conducted to evaluate differences in change from baseline hemoglobin and  the proportion of patients achieving a clinically-relevant response. RESULTS: The  SLR identified no completed RCTs of IIM versus FCM, 5 RCTs of IIM (4 versus oral  iron and 1 versus iron sucrose), and 14 RCTs of FCM (11 versus oral iron and 3  versus iron sucrose). In an ITC via iron sucrose, IIM resulted in a significantly  larger increase from baseline hemoglobin with a mean difference of +0.249 g/dL with  IIM relative to FCM, but there was no significant difference in the proportion of  patients with a clinically-relevant response. CONCLUSIONS: IIM resulted in a larger  increase from baseline hemoglobin than FCM in patients with IDA, but with no  difference in the proportion of patients responding. Studies comparing IIM and FCM  directly would be needed to confirm these findings.",NA,"Pollock, Richard F Muduma, Gorden",Pollock RF Muduma G,NA,"a Health Economics , Covalence Research Ltd , London , UK. b International Market Access , Pharmacosmos A/S , Holbæk , Denmark.",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Systematic Review",20190219,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,NOTNLM,*Iron deficiency anemia *administration *indirect treatment comparison *intravenous *iron,2019/01/29 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed] 2020/05/19 06:00 [medline] 2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/17474086.2019.1575202 [doi],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 Feb;12(2):129-136. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1575202.

An increasing number of biologic treatments, including biosimilars, are  available for the treatment of spondyloarthritis. Although there are a growing  number of randomised controlled trials assessing treatments in spondyloarthritis,  there is a paucity of data from head-to-head studies. Comparative data are required  so that clinicians and payers have the level of evidence required to inform clinical  decision-making and health economic assessments. In the absence of head-to-head  studies, statistical methods such as network meta-analyses and matching-adjusted  indirect comparisons (MAICs) are used for assessing comparative  effectiveness.Network meta-analysis can be used to compare treatments for trials  using a common comparator (e.g. placebo); however, for those without a common  comparator or where considerable heterogeneity exists between the study populations,  a MAIC that controls for differences in study design and baseline patient  characteristics may be used. MAICs, unlike network meta-analyses, are of value for  longer-term comparisons beyond the placebo-controlled phase of clinical trials,  which is important for chronic diseases requiring long-term treatment, like  spondyloarthritis. At present, there are a number of limitations that restrict the  effectiveness of MAIC, such as the poor availability of individual patient-level  data from trials, which results in patient-level data from one trial being compared  with published whole-population data from another. Despite these limitations, drug  reimbursement agencies are increasingly accepting MAIC as a means of comparative  effectiveness and greater methodological guidance is needed.This report highlights a  number of challenges that are specific to conducting comparative studies like MAIC  in spondyloarthritis, including disease heterogeneity, the paucity of biomarkers and  the duration of studies required for radiographic endpoints in this slow-progressing  disease.",NA,"Choy, Ernest Baraliakos, Xenofon Behrens, Frank D'Angelo, Salvatore de Vlam, Kurt Kirkham, Bruce W Østergaard, Mikkel Schett, Georg A Rissler, Michael Chaouche-Teyara, Kamel Perella, Chiara",Choy E Baraliakos X Behrens F D'Angelo S de Vlam K Kirkham BW Østergaard M Schett GA Rissler M Chaouche-Teyara K Perella C,NA,"CREATE Centre, Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of  Medicine, Wales, UK.

These methods are challenged when  differences between studies exist, including inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome  definitions, patient characteristics, as well as ensuring the choice of a common  comparator. OBJECTIVES: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) can address  these challenges, but the appropriate application of MAICs is uncertain. Examples  include whether to match between individual-level data and aggregate-level data  studies separately for treatment arms or to combine the arms, which matching  algorithm should be used, and whether to include the control treatment outcome  and/or covariates present in individual-level data. RESULTS: Results from seven  matching approaches applied to a continuous outcome in six simulated scenarios  demonstrated that when no effect modifiers were present, the matching methods were  equivalent to the unmatched Bucher approach. When effect modifiers were present,  matching methods (regardless of approach) outperformed the Bucher method. Matching  on arms separately produced more precise estimates compared with matching on total  moments, and for certain scenarios, matching including the control treatment outcome  did not produce the expected effect size. The entropy balancing approach was used to  determine whether there were any notable advantages over the method proposed by  Signorovitch et al. When unmeasured effect modifiers were present, no approach was  able to estimate the true treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the Bucher  approach (no matching), the MAICs examined demonstrated more accurate estimates, but  further research is required to understand these methods across an array of  situations.",Copyright © 2019 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes  Research.

Methods: A model comparing  P + C versus C alone is developed utilizing partitioned survival analysis. Primary  clinical efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility and safety data are derived  from the KEYNOTE-407 trial and projected over 20 years. Costs for drugs and non-drug  disease management are also incorporated. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of  P + C vs. pembrolizumab monotherapy (P) is evaluated via an indirect treatment  comparison, for patient subgroups with PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50% and  1-49%. Results: Overall, P + C is projected to increase life expectancy by  1.95 years vs. C (3.86 versus 1.91). The resultant ICER is $86,293/QALY. In patients  with PD-L1 ≥ 50%, 1-49% and <1 the corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness  ratios (ICERs) are $99,777/QALY, $85,986/QALY and $87,507/QALY, respectively. Versus  P, in the PD-L1 ≥ 50% subgroup, P + C appears cost saving; however, this result  should be interpreted with caution as there is considerable uncertainty in the  relative efficacy of these comparators. Conclusions: Across all eligible patients,  the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is projected to approximately double  life expectancy, yielding an extension to a point not previously seen in metastatic  squamous NSCLC. Overall, and within all relevant PD-L1 subgroups, use of P + C  yields an ICER below $100,000/QALY, and can be a cost-effective first-line treatment  for eligible metastatic squamous NSCLC patients for whom chemotherapy is currently  administered. In the PD-L1 ≥ 50% subgroup, additional follow-up within trials of  pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and pembrolizumab monotherapy are needed to better  define cost-effectiveness between these comparators.",NA,"Insinga, Ralph P Vanness, David J Feliciano, Josephine L Vandormael, Kristel Traore, Sory Ejzykowicz, Flavia Burke, Thomas",Insinga RP Vanness DJ Feliciano JL Vandormael K Traore S Ejzykowicz F Burke T,NA,"a Center for Observational and Real-World Evidence , Merck & Co.

A systematic review  and network metanalysis of randomized controlled trials comparing Shouldice and  Desarda.,S1743-9191(19)30003-2 [pii] 10.1016/j.ijsu.2019.01.001 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines state that the Shouldice technique has lower  recurrence rates than other suture repairs and therefore is strongly recommended in  non-mesh inguinal hernia repair. Recently a new tissue repair technique has been  proposed by Desarda and studied in trials against Lichtenstein technique. METHODS:  The present study was performed according to the PRISMA Statement for Network  Meta-analysis and the AMSTAR 2 checklist. The method of network meta-analysis was  chosen to evaluate randomized controlled trial published on tissue repair and  comparing Lichtenstein respectively with Desarda and Shouldice techniques. The  following parameters: operative time, recurrence, complications (general,  intraoperative, Surgical Surgical Site Occurrences), VAS score on postoperative day  1, numbness, chronic pain and return to daily activities. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs,  involving 2791 patients, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were selected for  final analysis. The anchored indirect treatment comparison showed that Desarda's  technique requires a significantly shorter operative time (MD: -12.9 min; 95% CI:  -20.6 to -5.2) and has a quicker recovery (MD: -6.6 days; 95% CI: -11.7 to -1.4).  Outcomes concerning intraoperative complications, early postoperative pain,  seroma/hematoma, hydrocele and infection rates, recurrence, numbness and chronic  pain were similar among the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Desarda's hernia repair can  be a valuable alternative to Shouldice technique for the treatment of primary  inguinal hernia repair if a non-mesh technique is chosen, because of its  reproducibility and quicker postoperative recovery. We recommend performing well  designed prospective studies comparing both techniques directly.",Copyright © 2019 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to determine the association between  treatment effects on early changes in albuminuria and treatment effects on clinical  endpoints and surrograte endpoints, to inform the use of albuminuria as a surrogate  endpoint in future randomised controlled trials. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we  searched PubMed for publications in English from Jan 1, 1946, to Dec 15, 2016, using  search terms including ""chronic kidney disease"", ""chronic renal insufficiency"",  ""albuminuria"", ""proteinuria"", and ""randomized controlled trial""; key inclusion  criteria were quantifiable measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria at baseline  and within 12 months of follow-up and information on the incidence of end-stage  kidney disease. We requested use of individual patient data from the authors of  eligible studies. For all studies that the authors agreed to participate and that  had sufficient data, we estimated treatment effects on 6-month change in albuminuria  and the composite clinical endpoint of treated end-stage kidney disease, estimated  glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL/min per 1·73 m(2), or doubling of  serum creatinine. We used a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression analysis to  relate the treatment effects on albuminuria to those on the clinical endpoint across  studies and developed a prediction model for the treatment effect on the clinical  endpoint on the basis of the treatment effect on albuminuria. FINDINGS: We  identified 41 eligible treatment comparisons from randomised trials (referred to as  studies) that provided sufficient patient-level data on 29 979 participants (21 206  [71%] with diabetes). Over a median follow-up of 3·4 years (IQR 2·3-4·2), 3935 (13%)  participants reached the composite clinical endpoint. Across all studies, with a  meta-regression slope of 0·89 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0·13-1·70), each  30% decrease in geometric mean albuminuria by the treatment relative to the control  was associated with an average 27% lower hazard for the clinical endpoint (95% BCI  5-45%; median R(2) 0·47, 95% BCI 0·02-0·96). The association strengthened after  restricting analyses to patients with baseline albuminuria of more than 30 mg/g (ie,  3·4 mg/mmol; R(2) 0·72, 0·05-0·99]). For future trials, the model predicts that  treatments that decrease the geometric mean albuminuria to 0·7 (ie, 30% decrease in  albuminuria) relative to the control will provide an average hazard ratio (HR) for  the clinical endpoint of 0·68, and 95% of sufficiently large studies would have HRs  between 0·47 and 0·95. INTERPRETATION: Our results support a role for change in  albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint for the progression of chronic kidney disease,  particularly in patients with high baseline albuminuria; for patients with low  baseline levels of albuminuria this association is less certain.

Mobile phone interventions to promote  healthier behaviors (mobile health, mHealth) have the potential to reach a large  number of people at a low cost. It has been hypothesized that mHealth interventions  may not be as effective as face-to-face strategies in achieving smoking cessation,  but there is no systematic evidence to support this, especially among PLHIV.  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare two modes of intervention delivery (mHealth  vs face-to-face) for smoking cessation among PLHIV. METHODS: Literature on  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating effects of mHealth or face-to-face  intervention strategies on short-term (4 weeks to <6 months) and long-term (≥6  months) smoking abstinence among PLHIV was sought. We systematically reviewed  relevant RCTs and conducted pairwise meta-analyses to estimate relative treatment  effects of mHealth and face-to-face interventions using standard care as comparison.  Given the absence of head-to-head trials comparing mHealth with face-to-face  interventions, we performed adjusted indirect comparison meta-analyses to compare  these interventions. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies involving 1772 PLHIV met the  inclusion criteria. The average age of the study population was 45 years, and women  comprised about 37%. In the short term, mHealth-delivered interventions were  significantly more efficacious in increasing smoking cessation than no intervention  control (risk ratio, RR, 2.81, 95% CI 1.44-5.49; n=726) and face-to-face  interventions (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.13-4.72; n=726). In the short term, face-to-face  interventions were no more effective than no intervention in increasing smoking  cessation (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.94-1.58; n=1144). In terms of achieving long-term  results among PLHIV, there was no significant difference in the rates of smoking  cessation between those who received mHealth-delivered interventions, face-to-face  interventions, or no intervention. Trial sequential analysis showed that only 15.16%  (726/1304) and 5.56% (632/11,364) of the required information sizes were accrued to  accept or reject a 25% relative risk reduction for short- and long-term smoking  cessation treatment effects. In addition, sequential monitoring boundaries were not  crossed, indicating that the cumulative evidence may be unreliable and inconclusive.  CONCLUSIONS: Compared with face-to-face interventions, mHealth-delivered  interventions can better increase smoking cessation rate in the short term. The  evidence that mHealth increases smoking cessation rate in the short term is  encouraging but not sufficient to allow a definitive conclusion presently. Future  research should focus on strategies for sustaining smoking cessation treatment  effects among PLHIV in the long term.","©Olalekan A Uthman, Chidozie U Nduka, Mustapha Abba, Rocio Enriquez, Helena  Nordenstedt, Fred Nalugoda, Andre P Kengne, Anna M Ekström.

To date, no formal guidance has been developed regarding how such  adjustments should be made. We compared various covariate-adjusted survival modeling  approaches, as applied to the ENDEAVOR trial in multiple myeloma that assessed  carfilzomib plus dexamethasone (Cd) versus bortezomib plus dexamethasone (Vd).  METHODS: Overall survival (OS) data and baseline characteristics were used for a  subgroup (bortezomib-naïve/one prior therapy). Four adjusted survival modeling  approaches were compared: propensity score weighting followed by fitting a Weibull  model to the two arms of the balanced data (weighted data approach); fitting a  multiple Weibull regression model including prognostic/predictive covariates to the  two arms to predict survival using the mean value of each covariate and using the  average of patient-specific survival predictions; and applying an adjusted hazard  ratio (HR) derived from a Cox proportional hazard model to the baseline risk  estimated for Vd. RESULTS: The mean OS estimated by the weighted data approach was  6.85 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.62-10.70) for Cd, 4.68 years (95% CI  3.46-6.74) for Vd, and 2.17 years (95% CI 0.18-5.06) for the difference. Although  other approaches estimated similar differences, using the mean value of covariates  appeared to yield skewed survival estimates (mean OS was 7.65 years for Cd and  5.40 years for Vd), using the average of individual predictions had limited external  validity (implausible long-term OS predictions with > 10% of the Vd population alive  after 30 years), and using the adjusted HR approach overestimated uncertainty  (difference in mean OS was 2.03, 95% CI - 0.17 to 6.19). CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted  survival modeling based on weighted or matched data approaches provides a flexible  and robust method to correct for covariate imbalances in economic evaluations. The  conclusions of our study may be generalizable to other settings.

The impact of missing outcome data on the  meta-analysis summary effect can be explored by assuming a relationship between the  outcome in the observed and the missing participants via an informative missingness  parameter. The informative missingness parameters cannot be estimated from the  observed data, but they can be specified, with associated uncertainty, using  evidence external to the meta-analysis, such as expert opinion. The use of  informative missingness parameters in pairwise meta-analysis of aggregate data with  binary outcomes has been previously implemented in Stata by the metamiss command. In  this article, we present the new command metamiss2, which is an extension of  metamiss for binary or continuous data in pairwise or network meta-analysis. The  command can be used to explore the robustness of results to different assumptions  about the missing data via sensitivity analysis.",NA,"Chaimani, Anna Mavridis, Dimitris Higgins, Julian P T Salanti, Georgia White, Ian R",Chaimani A Mavridis D Higgins JPT Salanti G White IR,NA,"Paris Descartes University; inserm, UMR1153 Epidemiology and Statistics, Sorbonne  Paris Cité Research Center (cress), methods Team; Cochrane France, Paris, France.

Unlike previous NMA that used meta-regression to  account for potential confounding by systematic variation in treatment effect  modifiers across studies, this update incorporated individual patient-level data  (IPD) regression to provide more robust adjustment. METHODS: An updated review was  conducted to identify randomised controlled trials for inclusion in a Bayesian NMA.  The network included intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL) 2 mg bimonthly (2q8) after 5  initial doses, ranibizumab 0.5 mg as-needed (PRN), ranibizumab 0.5 mg  treat-and-extend (T&E), and laser photocoagulation. Outcomes included in the  analysis were change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), measured using an Early  Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, and patients with ≥10 and ≥ 15  ETDRS letter gains/losses at 12 months. Analyses were performed using networks  restricted to IPD-only and IPD and aggregate data with (i) no covariable adjustment,  (ii) covariable adjustment for baseline BVCA assuming common interaction effects  (against reference treatment), and (iii) covariable adjustments specific to each  treatment comparison (restricted to IPD-only network). RESULTS: Thirteen trials were  included in the analysis. IVT-AFL 2q8 was superior to laser in all analyses. IVT-AFL  2q8 showed strong evidence of superiority (95% credible interval [CrI] did not cross  null) versus ranibizumab 0.5 mg PRN for mean change in BCVA (mean difference 5.20,  95% CrI 1.90-8.52 ETDRS letters), ≥15 ETDRS letter gain (odds ratio [OR] 2.30, 95%  CrI 1.12-4.20), and ≥10 ETDRS letter loss (OR 0.25, 95% CrI 0.05-0.74) (IPD and  aggregate random-effects model with baseline BCVA adjustment). IVT-AFL 2q8 was not  superior to ranibizumab 0.5 mg T&E for mean change in BCVA (mean difference 5.15,  95% CrI -0.26-10.61 ETDRS letters) (IPD and aggregate random-effects model).  CONCLUSIONS: This NMA, which incorporated IPD to improve analytic robustness, showed  evidence of superiority of IVT-AFL 2q8 to laser and ranibizumab 0.5 mg PRN.

The aims of this review were to 1) explain why we cannot compare  trial-specific NNT estimates for the competing treatments evaluated in different  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2) outline the principles of how relative  treatment effects of different trials can be compared and results can be presented  as NNT, without violating the principles of valid between-trial comparisons. Our  premise is that ratio measures for relative treatment effects of response outcomes  are less prone to effect modification than absolute difference measures of response  outcomes. Accordingly, any between-trial comparisons of the efficacy of competing  interventions using the study-specific ORs are less likely to be invalid or biased  than comparisons based on the study-specific NNT estimates. However,  treatment-specific ORs obtained from a meta-analysis or taken directly from an  individual study can be transformed into consistent treatment-specific NNT estimates  that allow for credible comparisons of treatments when these ratio measures are  applied to the same reference response estimate. The theoretical discussion is  illustrated with a relevant indirect comparison of biologics for the treatment of  ulcerative colitis. Between-trial comparisons directly based on the NNT of  individual trials may result in erroneous conclusions and should be avoided.  Treatment-specific NNT estimates need to be based on the same probability of  response with the common reference treatment against which the interventions are  compared.",NA,"Jansen, Jeroen P Khalid, Javaria Mona Smyth, Michael D Patel, Haridarshan",Jansen JP Khalid JM Smyth MD Patel H,NA,"Evidence Synthesis and Decision Modeling, Precision Xtract, Oakland, CA, USA.

METHODS:  Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in prior sunitinib-treated  patients with mRCC were compared by conducting matching-adjusted indirect comparison  (MAIC) analyses, including base-case and sensitivity analyses. Individual  patient-level data from prior sunitinib-treated patients who received axitinib in  AXIS were weighted to match published baseline characteristics of prior  sunitinib-treated patients who received either cabozantinib or everolimus in METEOR.  RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in PFS (aHR [adjusted  hazard ratio] = 1.15 [CI: 0.82-1.63]) and OS (aHR = 1.00 [CI: 0.69-1.46]) between  axitinib versus cabozantinib in the base-case analysis. In the sensitivity analysis,  PFS (aHR = 1.39 [CI: 1.00-1.92]) and OS (aHR = 1.35 [CI: 0.95-1.92]) were shorter  for axitinib compared with cabozantinib; however, the OS difference was not  statistically significant. Axitinib was associated with significantly longer PFS  compared with everolimus in the base-case (aHR = 0.53 [CI: 0.36-0.80]) and  sensitivity analyses (aHR = 0.63 [CI: 0.45-0.88]), respectively. Results suggested  an OS benefit for axitinib versus everolimus in base-case analyses (aHR = 0.63 [CI:  0.42-0.96]); however, the difference in OS in the sensitivity analysis was not  statistically significant (aHR = 0.84 [CI: 0.59-1.18]). CONCLUSIONS: MAIC analyses  suggest PFS and OS for axitinib and cabozantinib are dependent on the Memorial Sloan  Kettering Cancer Center definition used; in the base-case analysis, there was no  significant difference in PFS and OS between axitinib and cabozantinib. In the  sensitivity analysis, PFS in favour of cabozantinib was significant; however, the  trend for prolonged OS with cabozantinib was not significant. For axitinib and  everolimus, MAIC analyses indicate patients treated with axitinib may have an  improved PFS and OS benefit when compared to everolimus.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology  Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the  independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the  evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the  company's submission (CS) to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the CS for  pembrolizumab was based on one phase II, single-arm, open-label, non-randomised  study (KEYNOTE-052), while the evidence for the comparator (carboplatin plus  gemcitabine) was based on four studies, including one randomised controlled trial  and three cohort studies. In the absence of head-to-head trials, the company  conducted an indirect treatment comparison for both progression-free survival (PFS)  and overall survival (OS), by firstly adjusting cross-study differences using a  simulated treatment comparison approach and then synthesizing the evidence based on  an assumption of constant hazard ratios using a standard meta-analysis model and  time-varying hazard ratios using fractional polynomial models. The treatment effect  of pembrolizumab was more favourable in the adjusted population compared with the  observed effect in the KEYNOTE-052 study. The company submitted a de novo  partitioned survival cohort simulation model, which partitions the OS time into PFS  and post-progression survival. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness  ratio (ICER) for pembrolizumab compared with carboplatin plus gemcitabine was  estimated to be £37,081 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, based on the  results within the company's health economic model. Following a critique of the  model, for their preferred base case the ERG corrected some minor model errors,  chose a progression approach for estimating utilities, and revised the extrapolation  of PFS and OS. The ERG's probabilistic base case ICER was estimated to be £67,068  per QALY gained. The ERG also undertook a range of exploratory sensitivity analyses  which suggested that the ICER was highly uncertain. In particular, the choices of  extrapolation for the OS of pembrolizumab and the stopping rule for pembrolizumab  had the largest impacts on the ICER. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended  pembrolizumab for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for treating locally  advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had  platinum-containing chemotherapy, provided that pembrolizumab was stopped at 2 years  of uninterrupted treatment, or earlier if the disease progresses, and the conditions  of the managed access agreement for pembrolizumab are followed.",NA,"Ren, Shijie Squires, Hazel Hock, Emma Kaltenthaler, Eva Rawdin, Andrew Alifrangis, Constantine",Ren S Squires H Hock E Kaltenthaler E Rawdin A Alifrangis C,ORCID: 0000-0003-3568-7124,"School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield, Regent  Court, 30 Regent Street, Sheffield, S1 4DA, UK. s.ren@sheffield.ac.uk.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Disease progression was simulated with a partitioned survival  model developed from the parameterization and extrapolation of survival curves of  postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- ABC from clinical trials with ribociclib or  palbociclib, both in combination with letrozole. The model was structured on the  basis of three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, and death), with  a 1-month cycle length and inclusion of subsequent treatments administered for  disease progression, over a time horizon of 15 years. Clinical, economic, and  quality of life parameters were drawn from clinical trials and the literature. The  use of resources and clinical practice in the Spanish setting was validated by a  panel of experts. The Spanish NHS perspective was adopted, taking into account  exclusively direct health costs from 2017 expressed in Euros. Drug prices used were  the reported ex-factory prices. Uncertainty of the parameters and robustness of the  results were evaluated using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses  (2,000 iterations). RESULTS: This cost-effectiveness analysis showed a greater  benefit (0.437 and 0.285 life-years gained [LYGs] and quality-adjusted life years  [QALYs] gained, respectively) and a slightly higher cost (€439.86) for  ribociclib+letrozole compared to palbociclib+letrozole. The resulting incremental  cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios were €1,007.69 per LYG and €1,543.62 per  QALY gained, respectively. The results of the multiple sensitivity analyses showed  limited dispersion of the outcomes, thus corroborating their robustness. CONCLUSION:  From the NHS perspective, considering the most commonly established  willingness-to-pay thresholds in the Spanish setting, ribociclib+letrozole would  represent a cost-effective therapeutic option compared to palbociclib+letrozole in  the first-line treatment of HR+/HER2- ABC in postmenopausal women.",NA,"Galve-Calvo, Elena González-Haba, Eva Gostkorzewicz, Joana Martínez, Irene Pérez-Mitru, Alejandro",Galve-Calvo E González-Haba E Gostkorzewicz J Martínez I Pérez-Mitru A,NA,"Medical Oncology Service, Basurto University Hospital, Bilbao, Spain.

Until recently, tafamidis was the only  approved pharmacotherapy. Patisiran significantly improved polyneuropathy and  quality of life (QoL) in the phase III APOLLO trial. In the absence of direct  comparisons, this analysis aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of tafamidis  and patisiran in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:  Randomized controlled trial evidence for tafamidis was identified by systematic  literature review. Indirect treatment comparisons were performed using the standard  pairwise Bucher method for endpoints used in both APOLLO and the tafamidis Fx-005  trial: change from baseline in Neuropathy Impairment Score-lower limbs (NIS-LL),  Norfolk QoL-Diabetic Neuropathy questionnaire (QoL-DN), NIS-LL response, and mBMI  vs. placebo. Inter-trial population differences were assessed by sensitivity  analysis. RESULTS: The base-case analysis (FAP Stage 1 APOLLO patients vs.  intent-to-treat Fx-005 population) suggested patisiran had a greater treatment  effect vs. tafamidis for all endpoints, with significant improvements in mean change  in NIS-LL (-5.49) and QoL-DN (-13.10) from baseline to Month 18. Similar trends were  observed in all sensitivity analyses.

Until recently, TNF-alpha-inhibitors have  been the only biologics approved for the treatment of active AS. The objective of  this study was to assess the potential financial impact of the first non-TNF-alpha  biologic secukinumab (fully human IL-17A-inhibitor) vs adalimumab  (TNF-alpha-inhibitor) in the treatment of AS in Finland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In  this model-based budget impact analysis, patients were treated either with  secukinumab (150 mg) or adalimumab (40 mg). The number of patients and market share  of different biologics were based on national reimbursement registry data.  Adalimumab was the most commonly used biologic treatment for AS, and in the base  case analysis all adalimumab patients are assumed to switch to secukinumab. Response  rates were based on a matching-adjusted indirect comparison between secukinumab and  adalimumab. Patients not achieving response were switched to another biologic  treatment. RESULTS: Treating AS patients with secukinumab instead of adalimumab  leads to potential savings of 18.2 million euros within a 5-year time period. The  total costs within the follow-up time were 59.5 million euros and 77.7 million euros  with and without secukinumab, respectively. According to sensitivity analyses, a  higher adoption rate of secukinumab corresponds to higher potential savings.  CONCLUSIONS: Secukinumab is a cost-saving treatment option compared with adalimumab  in the treatment of AS in Finland.

Topical therapy is considered the treatment mainstay for mild-to-moderate disease  according to guidelines. Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD)  [0.005%/0.05%] aerosol foam is indicated for psoriasis vulgaris treatment in adults.  Cal/BD foam trials demonstrated improved efficacy and similar safety in this  population. Psoriasis treatment is complicated by the broad range of disease  presentation, variability and therapeutic options; particularly decisions on  transition from topical to non-biologic systemic treatment are difficult. Assessing  comparative effectiveness of treatment options provides meaningful value to  treatment decisions. OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy of Cal/BD foam individual  patient data from pooled trials with efficacy of non-biologic systemic treatments  based on aggregated patient characteristics and treatment outcomes. METHODS:  Individual data from four Cal/BD foam trials in 749 psoriasis patients were pooled  to conduct matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. Literature review identified  non-biologic systemic treatment trials where methods, populations and outcomes align  with Cal/BD foam trials. Of 3090 screened publications, four studies of apremilast,  methotrexate, acitretin or fumaric acid esters (FAE) were included. RESULTS: After  baseline matching, patients treated with 4 weeks of Cal/BD foam had greater  Physician's Global Assessment 0/1 response compared to those treated with 16 weeks  of apremilast (52.7% vs. 30.4%; P < 0.001). Patients treated with Cal/BD foam had  significantly greater Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response at Week 4  compared to 16 weeks of apremilast treatment (51.1% vs. 21.6%; P < 0.001). Cal/BD  foam patients demonstrated significantly greater PASI 75 response improvements at  Week 4 vs. 12 weeks of methotrexate (50.8% vs. 33.5%; P < 0.001) or acitretin (50.9%  vs. 31.7%; P = 0.009), and comparable response to FAE (42.4% vs. 47.0%; P = 0.451).  CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent treatment advances, unmet needs for psoriasis patients  remain.

The BMJ Technology Assessment Group  (BMJ-TAG) was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG), reviewing the  submission from the company. The Decision Support Unit (DSU) was commissioned to  review additional evidence submitted by the company and to undertake further  analyses. This article presents the critical review of the company's submissions by  the ERG and DSU, further analyses undertaken by the DSU, and the outcome of the NICE  guidance. The clinical effectiveness for dinutuximab beta was derived from a phase  III randomised controlled trial (RCT) that assessed the safety and efficacy of the  addition of interleukin (IL)-2 to dinutuximab beta plus isotretinoin. This trial did  not inform the relative effectiveness of dinutuximab beta versus isotretinoin alone,  which was established practice in the UK for maintenance treatment. In the absence  of direct evidence, the company initially conducted a naïve indirect treatment  comparison against a historical control, and later performed a matching-adjusted  indirect comparison (MAIC) against the isotretinoin arm of an RCT comparing  dinutuximab alpha and isotretinoin. The company submitted a partitioned survival  analysis model that calculated the incremental cost effectiveness of dinutuximab  beta versus isotretinoin. The company's original incremental cost-effectiveness  ratio (ICER) was £22,338 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. However, the  ERG were concerned that the company's ICER was not suitable for decision making, and  thus carried out initial exploratory analysis as a first step to overcome the naïve  estimation of treatment effectiveness in the model. The ERG's analysis estimated an  ICER of £111,858 per QALY gained. In their revised analysis incorporating the MAIC  and other changes as requested by the appraisal committee, the company's ICER was  £24,661 per QALY gained. When the DSU incorporated longer-term isotretinoin data and  made corrections to the model, the ICER increased to between £62,886 and £87,164 per  QALY gained depending on the choice of survival model. A confidential Patient Access  Scheme (PAS) decreased the ICERs. The ICERs with the PAS were over £40,000 per QALY  gained, but the NICE committee additionally considered the patient population and  its size, the disease severity, the potential for significant survival benefit and  uncaptured health benefits, and recommended dinutuximab beta as a treatment option,  subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the PAS.",NA,"Pennington, Becky Ren, Shije Barton, Samantha Bacelar, Mariana Edwards, Steven J",Pennington B Ren S Barton S Bacelar M Edwards SJ,ORCID: 0000-0002-1002-022X,"School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield, Regent Court, 30  Regent Street, Sheffield, S1 4DA, UK. b.pennington@sheffield.ac.uk.

Thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists have recently emerged as  promising therapies for ITP patients who are refractory to other treatments. While  eltrombopag (EPAG) is the only TPO-R agonist US Food and Drug Administration  approved for use in pediatric patients, romiplostin (ROMI) has been used in Phase  III clinical studies. METHODS: A cost-consequence model (CCM) was developed to  evaluate the costs of EPAG, ROMI, and watch-and-rescue (W&R) in relation to their  respective treatment outcomes in previously-treated pediatric chronic ITP (cITP)  over a 26-week time horizon. The costs of drugs, administration, routine care,  rescue medications, adverse events, and mortality were included. Data on platelet  count response rate, bleeding events, and adverse events were derived from all  relevant identified Phase III-registered clinical trials, health outcomes were  compared via indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: The overall estimated cost of  EPAG per patient was US$66,550, compared to US$101,056 for ROMI and US$32,720 for  W&R. EPAG's lower cost compared to ROMI was largely due to lower drug costs  (US$62,202 vs US$84,396), administration costs (US$0 vs US$1,955), and significantly  lower costs due to severe bleeding (US$354 vs US$10,191). When assessing cost per  severe bleeding event avoided, EPAG was dominant over ROMI (less expensive and more  effective). EPAG was again dominant over ROMI when assessing the cost per responder  and per bleeding event (any grade). Sensitivity analysis was consistent with the  base case findings. CONCLUSION: EPAG was the preferred TPO-R agonist to treat cITP  when indirectly compared to ROMI, largely driven by its favorable severe bleeding  outcomes and lower drug and administration costs.",NA,"Tremblay, Gabriel Dolph, Mike Bhor, Menaka Said, Qayyim Roy, Anuja Elliott, Brian Briggs, Andrew",Tremblay G Dolph M Bhor M Said Q Roy A Elliott B Briggs A,NA,"Health Economics, Purple Squirrel Economics, New York, NY, USA,  gabrieltremblay@pshta.com.

METHODS: A cost-consequence model was developed to evaluate the costs relative to  treatment success of EPAG, ROMI, and watch and rescue (W&R) in previously treated  patients. The primary endpoint assessed was severe bleeding, derived from all  identified phase III registered clinical trials. Health outcomes were compared via  indirect treatment comparison. Costs incorporated in the model included drug and  administration, routine care, rescue medications, bleeding-related adverse events,  other adverse events, and mortality costs. A trial (26-week) time horizon was used,  as certain endpoints used in the model were bound to within-trial results. RESULTS:  In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, the overall estimated cost per patient for  EPAG was US$66,560 compared to US$91,039 for ROMI and US$30,099 for W&R. Compared to  the ITT population, the difference in cost between EPAG and ROMI was slightly  greater in splenectomized patients (US$65,998 for EPAG compared to US$91,485 for  ROMI) and slightly less in non-splenectomized patients (US$67,151 for EPAG compared  to US$91,455 for ROMI), though the overall trend remained the same. When assessing  cost per severe bleeding event avoided in the ITT population, EPAG dominated (less  expensive, more effective) ROMI. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results.  CONCLUSION: EPAG was preferred over ROMI in the treatment of cITP, largely driven by  the reduction in severe bleeding events associated with its use.",NA,"Tremblay, Gabriel Dolph, Mike Bhor, Menaka Said, Qayyim Elliott, Brian Briggs, Andrew",Tremblay G Dolph M Bhor M Said Q Elliott B Briggs A,NA,"Department of Health Economics, Purple Squirrel Economics, New York, NY, USA,  gabrieltremblay@pshta.com.

The primary objective of this systematic review and  meta-analysis is to examine the class effect of beta-blocker use in patients with  COPD. We will focus on a broad range of endpoints including, clinical, safety, and  patient-centric outcomes such as health related quality of life (HRQoL) and  functional capacity. A secondary objective is to explore potential within-class  variation in the effects of beta-blockers among patients with COPD, and rank  individual agents according to their relative benefit(s). METHODS AND ANALYSIS:  MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied  Health Literature (CINAHL) databases will be systematically searched, from inception  to present, to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and other prospective  and interventional studies of beta-blocker use in patients with COPD which report on  the outcomes of interest. Relative treatment effects with respect to mortality, COPD  exacerbations, all-cause hospitalisation, lung function, HRQoL and exercise capacity  will be summarised by meta-analysis. Individual treatments (agents) will be compared  in a Bayesian network meta-analysis including RCT and observational data, if  feasible. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results of the study will be submitted for  publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Only previously published aggregate data  will be used for the purpose of this review. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:  CRD42018098983.",© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

It  is licensed for repair of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral  condyle and the patella of the knee with defect sizes up to 10 cm(2) in adults. In a  single technology appraisal (STA) [TA508] undertaken by the National Institute of  Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Warwick Evidence was the Evidence Review Group  (ERG) invited to independently review the evidence submitted by the manufacturer,  Co.Don. The clinical effectiveness data came from their COWISI randomised controlled  trial (RCT), which compared Chondrosphere with microfracture (MF). The timing of  this appraisal was unfortunate given that MF was no longer the most relevant  comparator because NICE had contemporaneously published guidance approving ACI in  place of MF. Moreover, the COWISI RCT enrolled mostly patients with small defect  sizes. Evidence of clinical effectiveness for Chondrosphere used in people with  larger defect size came from another RCT, which compared three doses of  Chondrosphere and that by design could not provide evidence comparing Chondrosphere  to any other forms of ACI. To estimate the relative clinical performance of  Chondrosphere versus other ACI, Co.Don conducted an indirect treatment comparison by  network meta-analyses (NMA). The NMA was flawed in that the distribution of  population characteristics that are effect modifiers greatly differed across the  treatment comparisons of the network. The ERG questioned both the appropriateness of  the NMA and the validity of the resulting estimates. Co.Don estimated the  cost-effectiveness of Chondrosphere using a lifetime Markov model with all patients  receiving the first repair during the first cycle of the model then moving into one  of three health states: success, no further repair (NFR), or a second repair, if  necessary. Subsequent to the first cycle, those who were a success either remained a  success or moved to second repair. All those in NFR remained in NFR. The  cost-effectiveness of Chondrosphere compared to other ACI forms relied on the  clinical effectiveness estimates of success and failure rates obtained from the  company's indirect comparisons, the validity of which the ERG questioned. The  company revised cost-effectiveness estimates for Chondrosphere versus MF and for  Chondrosphere versus matrix-applied characterised autologous cultured chondrocyte  implant (MACI) were £4360 and around £18,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained,  respectively. NICE recommended ACI using Chondrosphere for treating symptomatic  articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and patella of the knee in adults  only if certain requirements were met.",NA,"Armoiry, Xavier Cummins, Ewen Connock, Martin Metcalfe, Andrew Royle, Pamela Johnston, Rhona Rodrigues, Jeremy Waugh, Norman Mistry, Hema",Armoiry X Cummins E Connock M Metcalfe A Royle P Johnston R Rodrigues J Waugh N Mistry H,ORCID: 0000-0002-5023-1160,"Warwick Evidence, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road,  Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK.

METHODS: Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data  extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Indirect treatment comparisons were carried  out by directly assessing HR differences and statistical modeling of Kaplan-Meier  curves from these two trials. RESULTS: Publications identified showed that no  head-to-head comparisons had been carried out. Two indirect treatment comparisons  used agreed that there was no significant difference in OS between cabozantinib and  nivolumab and that cabozantinib significantly improved PFS compared to nivolumab.  CONCLUSIONS: The field of aRCC treatments is evolving rapidly, creating  opportunities for individualized treatments and challenges for clinicians to keep up  with the evidence.

METHODS: Pooled individual  patient data from the secukinumab arms of MEASURE 1 (NCT01358175) and MEASURE 2  (NCT01649375) trials (n=197) were matched against the ATLAS (NCT00085644) adalimumab  population (n=208). Logistic regression analysis was used to determined weights to  match for age, sex, Bath AS Functional Index, C-reactive protein levels, and  previous tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy. Recalculated Assessment of  SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 20 and 40 responses at weeks 8, 12,  16, 24, and 52 from MEASURE 1/2 (effective sample size=120) were compared with those  of ATLAS. Anchored (placebo-adjusted) comparisons were possible until week 12, and  unanchored (non-placebo-adjusted) comparisons were necessary thereafter. RESULTS:  For placebo-anchored ASAS 20 and 40 comparisons up to week 12, there were no  differences between secukinumab and adalimumab. For unanchored comparisons at week  16, ASAS 20 was higher for secukinumab [odds ratio 1.60 (95% confidence interval,  1.01-2.54); p=0.047]; at week 24, ASAS 20 and 40 were higher for secukinumab [1.76  (1.11-2.79); p=0.017 and 1.79 (1.14-2.82); p=0.012, respectively]; and at week 52,  ASAS 40 was higher for secukinumab [1.54 (1.06-2.23); p=0.023] than for adalimumab.  CONCLUSION: There were no differences observed in placebo-adjusted ASAS 20 and 40  responses up to 12 weeks between secukinumab- and adalimumab-treated patients with  ankylosing spondylitis.

Patient-level data from ASCEND-4 and published summary data from PROFILE  1014 were used. Patients in ASCEND-4 were reweighted to match average baseline  characteristics (i.e. age, sex, race, tumor histology, ECOG score, smoking status,  extent of disease, and presence of brain metastases) reported for PROFILE 1014  patients using propensity score weighting. PFS and OS were then compared between  balanced populations.Results: ASCEND-4 included more current smokers (8.0% vs 4.4%)  and fewer patients under the age of 65 years (78.5% vs 84.0%) compared to PROFILE  1014. After matching, these and all other patient characteristics were balanced  between the two trial populations. Compared to crizotinib, ceritinib was associated  with a significantly longer PFS (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] (HR  [CI]) = 0.64 [0.47-0.87]; median PFS: 25.2 vs 10.8 months, log-rank  p-value = 0.003). OS did not differ significantly, with a HR of 0.82 [0.54-1.27] for  ceritinib compared to crizotinib.Conclusions: In the adjusted indirect comparison  with external controls, the second generation ALK inhibitor, ceritinib, was  associated with a significantly prolonged PFS compared to crizotinib as first-line  treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC.",NA,"Li, Junlong Knoll, Stefanie Bocharova, Iryna Tang, Wenxi Signorovitch, James",Li J Knoll S Bocharova I Tang W Signorovitch J,NA,"Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, MA USA.

MATERIALS  AND METHODS: We systematically reviewed 74 randomized controlled trials (74,832  participants) published up to 15 November 2017, which compared any of the  interventions (SAMA [ipratropium], LAMA [aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium,  umeclidinium], LAMA/LABA [aclidinium/formoterol, indacaterol/glycopyrronium,  tiotropium/olodaterol, umeclidinium/vilanterol] and ICS/LABA  [fluticasone/vilanterol, budesonide/formoterol, salmeterol/fluticasone]) with each  other or with placebo. A random-effects network meta-analysis combining direct and  indirect evidence was conducted to examine the change from baseline in trough  FEV(1), transition dyspnea index, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and  frequency of adverse events at weeks 12 and 24. RESULTS: Inconsistency models were  not statistically significant for all outcomes. LAMAs, LAMA/LABAs and ICS/LABAs led  to a significantly greater improvement in trough FEV(1) compared with placebo and  SAMA monotherapy at weeks 12 and 24. All LAMA/LABAs, except aclidinium/formoterol,  were statistically significantly better than LAMA monotherapy and ICS/LABAs in  improving trough FEV(1). Among the LAMAs, umeclidinium showed statistically  significant improvement in trough FEV(1) at week 12 compared to tiotropium and  glycopyrronium, but the results were not clinically significant. LAMA/LABAs had the  highest probabilities of being ranked the best agents in FEV(1) improvement. Similar  trends were observed for the transition dyspnea index and St George's Respiratory  Questionnaire outcomes. There were no significant differences in the incidences of  adverse events among all treatment options. CONCLUSION: LAMA/LABA showed the  greatest improvement in trough FEV(1) at weeks 12 and 24 compared with the other  inhaled drug classes, while SAMA showed the least improvement.

This study aimed to identify  and analyze evidence supporting the use of the emerging magnetic resonance-guided  focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) compared to alternative stimulatory and ablative  interventions for the treatment of medication-refractory essential tremor:  radiofrequency thalamotomy, unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS), and  stereotactic radiosurgery. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to  identify clinical, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and economic evidence for  each intervention. Because of the lack of comparative evidence captured, a  feasibility assessment was performed to determine possible comparisons between  interventions, and newly established matching-adjusted indirect comparison and  simulated treatment comparison techniques were used to conduct a comparison between  unilateral DBS aggregate data and MRgFUS individual patient data. RESULTS: The  systematic literature review identified 1,559 records, and screening yielded 46  relevant articles. The captured studies demonstrated that radiofrequency  thalamotomy, DBS, stereotactic radiosurgery, and MRgFUS all exhibit clinical  efficacy, with variation in onset and duration of tremor relief, and are each  associated with a unique safety profile. The matching-adjusted indirect comparison  and simulated treatment comparison results demonstrated no evidence of a difference  in efficacy (measured by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Total) and HRQoL (measured  by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Part C) outcomes between MRgFUS and unilateral  DBS in the short term (≤12 months). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary  evidence that MRgFUS could elicit similar short-term tremor- and HRQoL-related  benefits to DBS, the current standard of care, and allowed for the first robust  statistical comparison between these interventions.",Copyright © 2018 ISPOR --The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes  Research.

The  gold-standard method used individual data from both the trial and CPRD to predict  probabilities of being sampled in the trial and to reweight trial participants to  reflect CPRD patient characteristics. Methods 1 and 2 used weighting methods based  on simulated individual data or the method of moments, respectively. Method 3  weighted the trial's subgroup-specific treatment effects to match the distribution  of an effect modifier in CPRD. Method 4 calculated the expected absolute benefits in  CPRD assuming homogeneous relative treatment effect. Methods based on aggregate data  for the target population generally yielded results between the trial and  gold-standard estimates. Methods 1 and 2 yielded estimates closest to the  gold-standard estimates when continuous effect modifiers were represented as  categorical variables.

Approval of tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, represents  a new and potentially curative treatment option. However, tisagenlecleucel is  expensive, with a current list price of $475 000 per one-time administration.  OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term survival and value of tisagenlecleucel for  children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN, SETTING,  AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a decision analytic model was  designed to extrapolate trial evidence to a patient lifetime horizon. The survival  evidence for the model was extracted from 3 studies: B2202 (enrolled patients from  April 8, 2015, to November 23, 2016), B2205J (enrolled patients from August 14,  2014, to February 1, 2016), and B2101J (enrolled patients from March 15, 2012, to  November 30, 2015). Long-term survival and outcomes of patients younger than 25  years with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or  later relapse were derived using flexible parametric modeling from the direct  extrapolation of event-free survival and overall survival curves. The published  Kaplan-Meier curves were digitized from November 1, 2017, to November 30, 2017,  using an algorithm to impute patient-level time-to-event data. Sensitivity and  scenario analyses assessed uncertainty in the evidence and model assumptions to  further bound the range of cost-effectiveness. Data were analyzed from December 1,  2017, to March 31, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: The primary intervention of interest was  tisagenlecleucel. The comparator of interest was the chemoimmunotherapeutic agent  clofarabine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Model outcomes included life-years gained,  quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental costs per life-year and  QALY gained. RESULTS: Forty percent of patients initiating treatment with  tisagenlecleucel are expected to be long-term survivors, or alive and responding to  treatment after 5 years. Tisagenlecleucel had a total discounted cost of $667 000,  with discounted life-years gained of 10.34 years and 9.28 QALYs gained. The  clofarabine comparator had a total discounted cost of approximately $337 000, with  discounted life-years gained of 2.43 years and 2.10 QALYs gained. This difference  resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately $42 000 per  life-year gained and approximately $46 000 per QALY gained for tisagenlecleucel vs  clofarabine. These results were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Across  scenario analyses that included more conservative assumptions regarding long-term  relapse and survival, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $37 000  to $78 000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Tisagenlecleucel likely  provides gains in survival and seems to be priced in alignment with these benefits.  This study suggests that payers and innovators should develop novel payment models  that reduce the risk and uncertainty around long-term value and provide safeguards  to ensure high-value care.",NA,"Whittington, Melanie D McQueen, R Brett Ollendorf, Daniel A Kumar, Varun M Chapman, Richard H Tice, Jeffrey A Pearson, Steven D Campbell, Jonathan D",Whittington MD McQueen RB Ollendorf DA Kumar VM Chapman RH Tice JA Pearson SD Campbell JD,NA,"Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus,  Aurora.

Pembrolizumab was recently  approved in the US for the treatment of such patients having demonstrated clinical  benefit and tolerability in relapsed/refractory cHL; however, the cost-effectiveness  of pembrolizumab in this population is currently unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  three-state Markov model (progression-free [PF], progressed disease, and death) was  developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab (200 mg) vs brentuximab  vedotin (BV; 1.8 mg/kg) in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL after ASCT who have  not received BV post-ASCT over a 20-year time horizon from a US payer perspective.  PF survival was modeled using a naïve indirect treatment comparison of data from  KEYNOTE-087 and the SG035-003 trial. Post-progression survival was modeled using  data from published literature. Costs (drug acquisition and administration, disease  management, subsequent treatment, and adverse events) and outcomes were discounted  at an annual rate of 3.0%. Uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness was assessed  via probabilistic, deterministic, and scenario analyses. RESULTS: In the base case,  pembrolizumab was predicted to yield an additional 0.574 life-years (LYs) and 0.500  quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) vs BV and cost savings of $63,278. Drug  acquisition costs were the biggest driver of incremental costs between strategies.  Pembrolizumab had a 99.6% probability of being cost-effective compared with BV at a  willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000/QALY and dominated BV in all scenarios  tested. LIMITATIONS: The analysis was subject to potential bias due to the use of a  naïve indirect treatment comparison and, given the current immaturity of OS in  KEYNOTE-087, PPS was assumed equivalent across both treatments. CONCLUSION:  Pembrolizumab is a cost-effective alternative to BV for patients with  relapsed/refractory cHL after ASCT.",NA,"Large, Samuel Hettle, Robert Balakumaran, Arun Wu, Elise Borse, Rebekah H",Large S Hettle R Balakumaran A Wu E Borse RH,NA,"a PAREXEL International , London , UK. a PAREXEL International , London , UK. b Merck & Co., Inc. , Kenilworth , NJ , USA. b Merck & Co., Inc. , Kenilworth , NJ , USA. b Merck & Co., Inc. , Kenilworth , NJ , USA.",eng,NA,Journal Article,20181113,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,NA,NOTNLM,Cost-effectiveness I10 I19 brentuximab vedotin classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma cost-utility economic evaluation pembrolizumab relapse/refractory,2018/10/12 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,2018/10/11 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed] 2018/10/12 06:00 [medline] 2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/13696998.2018.1534738 [doi],aheadofprint,J Med Econ. 2018 Nov 13:1-10. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2018.1534738.,NA,NA,1-10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The CRD (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) and CHE (Centre for Health  Economics) Technology Assessment Group at the University of York was commissioned to  act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the Company's  submission (CS), the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The evidence  submitted in support of ceritinib, as the first-line treatment in ALK+ advanced  NSCLC, was a phase III, international, multicentre, open-label randomised controlled  trial (RCT) comparing ceritinib with pemetrexed/cisplatin plus pemetrexed  maintenance therapy (chemotherapy [CT] group). The results indicated that ceritinib  prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with CT. The only comparator  considered in the CS was crizotinib. The evidence selected in support of crizotinib  was PROFILE 1014, an open-label RCT of crizotinib, compared with  pemetrexed/cisplatin CT (without maintenance therapy), in previously untreated  advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC. The design and population of PROFILE 1014 was  similar to that of ASCEND-4, though there were some differences between the trials.  The Company considered it not possible to perform an 'anchor-based' analysis of  first-line ceritinib and crizotinib, and presented a Matching-Adjusted Indirect  Comparison (MAIC) of ceritinib and crizotinib using only the ALK inhibitor arm of  ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. The indirect comparison suggests that ceritinib may be  more effective in prolonging PFS than crizotinib. The ERG agreed that an indirect  comparison using only the ALK inhibitor arm of the trials was the only option  available in the present assessment; however, a number of limitations and potential  bias were identified in this analysis. The Company's model estimated that ceritinib  was cost effective when compared with crizotinib. However, the ERG highlighted  several concerns with the Company's analysis; the ERG's preferred base case  estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £69,255 per quality-adjusted  life-year (no patient access scheme [PAS] included). The ERG considered the economic  analysis to be sensitive to changes in assumption used, partly due to the due to the  immaturity of the overall survival data from trials, which leads to uncertainty  around the extrapolation used. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that ceritinib  is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for untreated ALK+  advanced NSCLC in adults, if the Company provides it with the discount agreed in the  PAS.",NA,"Claxton, Lindsay O'Connor, Joanne Woolacott, Nerys Wright, Kath Hodgson, Robert",Claxton L O'Connor J Woolacott N Wright K Hodgson R,ORCID: 0000-0002-1795-7568,"Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, YO10 5DD, UK.  lindsay.claxton@york.ac.uk.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in  collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned to act as  the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG), which produced a detailed review of the  evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the  company's submission to NICE. Nivolumab was compared with docetaxel, paclitaxel,  best supportive care and retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin  plus gemcitabine, but only for patients whose disease has had an adequate response  in first-line treatment). Two ongoing, phase I/II, single-arm studies for nivolumab  were identified, but no studies directly compared nivolumab with any specified  comparator. Evidence from directly examining the single arms of the trial data  indicated little difference between the outcomes measured from the nivolumab and  comparator studies. A simulated treatment comparison (STC) analysis was used in an  attempt to reduce the bias induced by naïve comparison, but there was no clear  evidence that risk of bias was reduced. Multiple limitations in the STC were  identified and remained. The effect of an analysis based on different combinations  of covariates in the prediction model remains unknown. The ERG's concerns regarding  the economic analysis included the use of a non-established response-based survival  analysis method, which introduced additional uncertainty. The use of time-dependent  hazard ratios produced overfitting and was not represented in the probabilistic  sensitivity analysis. The use of a treatment stopping rule to cap treatment cost  left treatment effectiveness unaltered. A relevant comparator was excluded from the  base-case analysis. The revised ERG deterministic base-case incremental  cost-effectiveness ratios based on the company's Appraisal Consultation Document  response were £58,791, £78,869 and £62,352 per quality-adjusted life-year gained  versus paclitaxel, docetaxel and best supportive care, respectively. Nivolumab was  dominated by cisplatin plus gemcitabine in the ERG base case. Substantial  uncertainties about the relative treatment effectiveness comparing nivolumab against  all comparators remained. NICE did not recommend nivolumab, within its marketing  authorisation, as an option for treating locally advanced, unresectable or  metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had platinum-containing therapy,  and considered that nivolumab was not suitable for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund.",NA,"Grimm, Sabine E Armstrong, Nigel Ramaekers, Bram L T Pouwels, Xavier Lang, Shona Petersohn, Svenja Riemsma, Rob Worthy, Gillian Stirk, Lisa Ross, Janine Kleijnen, Jos Joore, Manuela A",Grimm SE Armstrong N Ramaekers BLT Pouwels X Lang S Petersohn S Riemsma R Worthy G Stirk L Ross J Kleijnen J Joore MA,ORCID: 0000-0002-2175-7999,"Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Medical Technology Assessment, School for  Public Health and Primary Care (CAPHRI), Maastricht University Medical Centre+, P.

A matching-adjusted  indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted to estimate the relative efficacy of these  agents in the crizotinib-refractory setting. METHODS: MAIC is a propensity  score-type method that adjusts for differences in baseline characteristics between  trials to estimate relative efficacy. Analyses were based on patient-level data from  the ALTA trial for brigatinib and published summary-level trial data from ASCEND-1  and ASCEND-2 for ceritinib and NP28761 and NP28673 for alectinib. Objective response  rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were  compared. RESULTS: After matching, all key baseline characteristics were balanced  between trials. Compared with ceritinib, brigatinib was associated with longer PFS  (ASCEND-1: median 15.7 vs 6.9 months, hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence  interval] = 0.38 [0.26-0.57]; ASCEND-2: median = 18.3 vs 7.2 months, HR = 0.33  [0.20-0.56]) and OS (ASCEND-1: not available; ASCEND-2: median 27.6 vs 14.9 months,  HR = 0.33 [0.17-0.63]). Versus alectinib, brigatinib was associated with longer PFS  (NP28761: median = 17.6 vs 8.2 months, HR = 0.56 [0.36-0.86]; NP28673: median = 17.6  vs 8.9 months, HR = 0.61 [0.40-0.93]); results for OS were inconclusive (NP28761:  median = 27.6 vs 22.7 months, HR = 0.70 [0.42-1.16]; NP28673: median = 27.6 vs 26.0  months, HR = 0.66 [0.39-1.09]).

However, there are no  clinical trials that have directly compared these agents. We conducted a systematic  review and indirectly compared the efficacy of azacitidine to decitabine in MDS.  METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of several databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE,  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus) through June 28, 2018,  without language or time restrictions. Studies were screened by two independent  reviewers, and differences were resolved by consensus. The fixed effect model and  adjusted indirect comparison methods were used to pool relative risks (RR) of major  outcomes of interest (mortality, response rate, quality of life, hematologic  improvement, hospitalization, leukemia transformation, transfusion independence).  RESULTS: Only four trials met the eligibility criteria. Two trials compared  azacitidine to the best supportive care (BSC) and included 549 patients, and the  other two compared decitabine to BSC and included 403 patients. The risk of bias was  unclear overall. Compared to BSC, azacitidine was significantly associated with  lower mortality (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.94, I(2) = 89%) whereas decitabine did not  significantly reduce mortality (RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.00, I(2) = 53%). Both drugs  were associated with higher partial and complete response compared to BSC. Indirect  comparisons were not statistically significant for all the studied outcomes, except  for complete response where azacitidine was less likely to induce complete response  compared to decitabine (RR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.01-0.86, very low-certainty evidence).  CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine and decitabine are both associated with improved outcomes  compared to BSC. The available indirect evidence comparing the two agents warrants  very low certainty and cannot reliably confirm the superiority of either agent.  Head-to-head trials are needed. In the meantime, the choice of agent should be  driven by patient preferences, adverse effects, drug availability, and cost.",NA,"Almasri, Jehad Alkhateeb, Hassan B Firwana, Belal Sonbol, Mohamad Bassam Damlaj, Moussab Wang, Zhen Murad, M Hassan Al-Kali, Aref",Almasri J Alkhateeb HB Firwana B Sonbol MB Damlaj M Wang Z Murad MH Al-Kali A,ORCID: 0000-0001-6098-8450,"Evidence-Based Practice Research Program, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the  clinical effectiveness of three interventions [everolimus (Afinitor(®); Novartis  International AG, Basel, Switzerland), lutetium-177 DOTATATE (177Lu-DOTATATE)  (Lutathera(®); Imaging Equipment Ltd, Radstock, UK) and sunitinib (Sutent(®); Pfizer  Inc., New York, NY, USA)] for treating unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease  progression and establish the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. DATA  SOURCES: The following databases were searched from inception to May 2016: MEDLINE,  MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily, Epub Ahead of  Print, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science.  REVIEW METHODS: We systematically reviewed the clinical effectiveness and  cost-effectiveness literature on everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib for  treating advanced, unresectable or metastatic progressive NETs. The following NET  locations were considered separately: pancreas, gastrointestinal (GI) tract and  lung, and GI tract (midgut only). We wrote a survival partition cohort-based  economic evaluation in Microsoft Excel(®) 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA,  USA) from the UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. This comprised three  health states: (1) progression-free survival (PFS), (2) progressed disease and (3)  death. RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), RADIANT-3 [RAD001 in  Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Third Trial; pancreatic NETs (pNETs): everolimus vs.  best supportive care (BSC)], A6181111 (pNETs: sunitinib vs. BSC) and RADIANT-4  (RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Fourth Trial; GI and lung NETs:  everolimus vs. BSC), met the inclusion criteria for the clinical effectiveness  systematic review. The risk of bias was low. Although the NETTER-1 (Neuroendocrine  Tumors Therapy) RCT, of 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 mg of octreotide (Sandostatin(®),  Novartis) compared with 60 mg of octreotide, was excluded from the review, we  nonetheless present the results of this trial, as it informs our estimate of the  cost-effectiveness of 177Lu-DOTATATE. The pNETs trials consistently found that the  interventions improved PFS and overall survival (OS) compared with BSC. Our indirect  comparison found no significant difference in PFS between everolimus and sunitinib.  Estimates of OS gain were confounded because of high rates of treatment switching.  After adjustment, our indirect comparison suggested a lower, but non-significant,  hazard of death for sunitinib compared with everolimus. In GI and lung NETs,  everolimus significantly improved PFS compared with BSC and showed a non-significant  trend towards improved OS compared with BSC. Adverse events were more commonly  reported following treatment with targeted interventions than after treatment with  BSC. In the base case for pNETs, assuming list prices, we estimated incremental  cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for everolimus compared with BSC of £45,493 per  quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and for sunitinib compared with BSC of £20,717 per  QALY. These ICERs increased substantially without the adjustment for treatment  switching. For GI and lung NETs, we estimated an ICER for everolimus compared with  BSC of £44,557 per QALY. For GI (midgut) NETs, the ICERs were £199,233 per QALY for  everolimus compared with BSC and £62,158 per QALY for a scenario analysis comparing  177Lu-DOTATATE with BSC. We judge that no treatment meets the National Institute for  Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) end-of-life criteria, although we cannot rule  out that sunitinib in the A6181111 trial does. LIMITATIONS: A RCT with included  comparators was not identified for 177Lu-DOTATATE. The indirect treatment comparison  that our economic analysis was based on was of a simple Bucher type, unadjusted for  any differences in the baseline characteristics across the two trials. CONCLUSIONS:  Given NICE's current stated range of £20,000-30,000 per QALY for the  cost-effectiveness threshold, based on list prices, only sunitinib might be  considered good value for money in England and Wales. FUTURE WORK: Further analysis  of individual patient data from RADIANT-3 would allow assessment of the robustness  of our findings. The data were not made available to us by the company sponsoring  the trial. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42016041303.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the efficacy of licensed doses  of mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab in patients with SEA, according to  baseline blood eosinophil counts. METHODS: This indirect treatment comparison (ITC)  used data from a Cochrane review and independent searches. Eligible studies were  randomized controlled trials in patients aged 12 years or greater with SEA. End  points included annualized rate of clinically significant exacerbations and change  from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire score and FEV(1). An ITC was performed  in patients with Asthma Control Questionnaire scores of 1.5 or greater and  stratified by baseline blood eosinophil count. RESULTS: Eleven studies were  included. All treatments significantly reduced the rate of clinically significant  exacerbations and improved asthma control versus placebo in all blood eosinophil  count subgroups. Mepolizumab reduced clinically significant exacerbations by 34% to  45% versus benralizumab across subgroups (rate ratio ≥400 cells/μL: 0.55 [95% CI,  0.35-0.87]; ≥300 cells/μL: 0.61 [95% CI, 0.37-0.99]; and ≥150 cells/μL: 0.66 [95%  CI, 0.49-0.89]; all P < .05) and by 45% versus reslizumab in the 400 cells/μL or  greater subgroup (rate ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.36-0.85]; P = .007). Asthma control  was significantly improved with mepolizumab versus benralizumab (all subgroups:  P < .05) and versus reslizumab in the 400 cells/μL or greater subgroup (P = .004).  Benralizumab significantly improved lung function versus reslizumab in the  400 cells/μL or greater subgroup (P = .025). CONCLUSIONS: This ITC of the licensed  doses suggests that mepolizumab was associated with significantly greater  improvements in clinically significant exacerbations and asthma control compared  with reslizumab or benralizumab in patients with similar blood eosinophil counts.",Copyright © 2018 GlaxoSmithKline.

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: A model is developed utilizing partitioned survival analysis to estimate  the cost-effectiveness of KEYNOTE-189 trial comparators pembrolizumab + chemotherapy  (carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed) vs chemotherapy alone. Clinical efficacy,  treatment utilization, health utility, and safety data are derived from the trial  and projected over 20 years. For extrapolating survival beyond the trial, a novel  SEER population-data approach is applied (primary analysis), with separate  estimation via traditional parametric extrapolation methods. Costs for drugs and  non-drug disease management are also incorporated. Based on an indirect treatment  comparison, cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs pembrolizumab  monotherapy is evaluated for patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) ≥ 50%.  RESULTS: In the full non-squamous population, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is  projected to increase life expectancy by 2.04 years vs chemotherapy (3.96 vs 1.92),  for an approximate doubling of life years. Resultant incremental cost-effectiveness  ratios (ICERs) are $104,823/QALY and $87,242/life year. In patients with PD-L1 ≥ 50%  and 1-49%, life expectancy is more than doubled (4.53 vs 1.88 years) and (4.87 vs  2.01 years), with a 32% (2.60 vs 1.97 years) increase in PD-L1 < 1% patients.  Corresponding incremental costs/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are $103,402,  $66,837, and $183,529 for PD-L1 ≥ 50%, 1-49%, and <1% groups, respectively. Versus  pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 ≥ 50% patients, representing current standard of  care, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy increases life expectancy by 65% (4.53 vs 2.74  years) at an ICER of $147,365/QALY. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The addition of  pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is projected to extend life expectancy to a point not  previously seen in previously untreated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Although  ICERs vary by sub-group and comparator, results suggest pembrolizumab + chemotherapy  yields ICERs near, or in most cases, well below a 3-times US per capita GDP  threshold of $180,000/QALY, and may be a cost-effective first-line treatment for  metastatic non-squamous NSCLC patients.",NA,"Insinga, Ralph P Vanness, David J Feliciano, Josephine L Vandormael, Kristel Traore, Sory Burke, Thomas",Insinga RP Vanness DJ Feliciano JL Vandormael K Traore S Burke T,NA,"a Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. , Center for Observational and Real-World Evidence ,  North Wales , PA , USA. b Department of Health Policy and Administration , Pennsylvania State University,  State College , PA , USA. c The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University ,  Baltimore , MD , USA. d Merck Sharp & Dohme , HTA Statistics Europe , Brussels , Belgium. e Merck Sharp & Dohme , HTA Statistics Europe , London , UK. f Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. , Center for Observational and Real-World Evidence ,  Rahway , NJ , USA.",eng,NA,"Clinical Trial, Phase III Journal Article Randomized Controlled Trial",20180921,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,IM,NOTNLM,H89 I19 Lung cancer United States chemotherapy cost-effectiveness pembrolizumab,2018/09/07 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,2018/09/07 06:00,2018/09/07 06:00 [pubmed] 2019/04/10 06:00 [medline] 2018/09/07 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/13696998.2018.1521416 [doi],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2018 Dec;21(12):1191-1205. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2018.1521416.

An anchored MAIC was performed for progression-free survival (PFS); an  unanchored analysis was deemed more appropriate for OS due to crossover in both  trials. A hazard ratio for sunitinib versus everolimus was derived from adjusted  (weighted) sunitinib effects compared with the observed results for everolimus.

Macrolides for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in  adults: A systematic review and adjusted indirect treatment comparison.,10.1177/1479972318790269 [doi] 1479972318790269,"Non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by an  airway inflammatory response to bacterial pathogens. Frequent exacerbations have a  major influence on the quality of life. Macrolide antibiotics have not only  antibacterial but also immune-regulation effects. It is proved that macrolides have  a benefit in preventing exacerbations. However, it is still uncertain whether  azithromycin or erythromycin is more effective and safe. The purpose of this study  was to answer the following question: Which kind of macrolide antibiotic is more  effective and safe in preventing non-CF bronchiectasis exacerbation? We conducted a  systematic review to identify randomized clinical trials published up to May 2017  that reported on macrolides for non-CF bronchiectasis and an adjusted indirect  treatment comparison (AITC) between macrolides to evaluate their efficacy and  safety. The direct comparison meta-analysis found that macrolides decreased the rate  of exacerbation of non-CF bronchiectasis (risk ratio (RR) = 0.45; 95% confidence  interval (CI) 0.36-0.55) with heterogeneity ( I(2) = 63.7%, p = 0.064). The AITC  showed that azithromycin had a significantly lower bronchiectasis exacerbation rate  than erythromycin (RR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.403-0.947).

METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and Opengrey.eu were searched  for RCTs of AEDs used to treat post-stroke epilepsy. The following outcomes were  considered: seizure freedom; occurrence of adverse effects (AEs); withdrawal for  AEs. The methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for  Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Adjusted indirect comparisons were made between  each AED using controlled-release carbamazepine (CR-CBZ) as common comparator.  RESULTS: Only 2 RCTs were included, one comparing levetiracetam (LEV) with CR-CBZ  and the other comparing lamotrigine (LTG) with CR-CBZ. No significant difference was  found in seizure freedom between either LEV or LTG and CR-CBZ. Occurrence of AEs  were lower for LEV and LTG than for CR-CBZ. Indirect comparisons showed no  difference between LEV and LTG for seizure freedom (OR 0.86; 95%CI: 0.15-4.89).  Occurrence of AEs was higher for LEV than for LTG (OR 6.87; 95%CI: 1.15-41.1). For  withdrawal rates due to AEs, we found a large width and asymmetrical distribution of  confidence intervals around the obtained OR of 10.8 (95% CI: 0.78-149.71).  CONCLUSIONS: Direct and indirect comparisons did not find a difference in seizure  freedom between the various AEDs, probably because of the small number of patients  included. LEV and LTG appears better tolerated than CR-CBZ and LEV seems associated  with more AEs than LTG. Further studies are required to provide robust evidence on  efficacy and tolerability of AEDs for treating poststroke epilepsy.",Copyright © 2018 British Epilepsy Association.

To characterize the  overall benefit-risk profile in 3L CP-CML patients treated with bosutinib vs.  ponatinib, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to compare  efficacy outcomes and treatment duration after adjusting for trial subjects'  baseline characteristics, and tolerability was assessed with an unadjusted  comparison of study-drug discontinuation. METHODS: The MAIC was performed using  published data from the pivotal bosutinib trial and the most recent  individual-patient-level data on file from the pivotal ponatinib trial. RESULTS:  Responses were more frequent and durable with ponatinib (n = 70 MAIC-adjusted) than  with bosutinib (n = 119) - complete cytogenetic response (CCyR): 61% vs. 26%;  Kaplan-Meier estimate of maintaining CCyR at 4 years: 89% vs. 54%. Median treatment  duration was longer with ponatinib than with bosutinib: 38.4 vs. 8.6 months. Only 9%  of ponatinib patients (n = 97 unadjusted) vs. 42% of bosutinib patients discontinued  due to death, disease progression or unsatisfactory response; 19% vs. 24%  discontinued due to adverse events.

To determine  whether trial outcomes translate into similar event rates in unselected patients,  this analysis compared outcomes from the real-world XANTUS study with those from the  Phase III ROCKET AF study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual patient data from 4020  XANTUS patients were re-weighted to match the proportion of selected baseline  characteristics in 7061 rivaroxaban-treated patients from ROCKET AF, using the  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) method. For the primary analysis,  CHADS2 scores and gender were selected as relevant variables. Adjusted annualized  incidence rates for XANTUS were calculated and compared with incidence rates from  ROCKET AF-the ratio of these rates ('MAIC ratio') was used as a relative effect  estimate. Rates of major bleeding [3.10%/year vs. 3.60%/year; MAIC ratio 0.86; 95%  confidence interval (CI) 0.67-1.12] and stroke/non-central nervous system systemic  embolism (1.54%/year vs. 1.70%/year; MAIC ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.62-1.32) were similar  between XANTUS and ROCKET AF. The rate of all-cause death was higher in XANTUS  (3.22%/year vs. 1.87%/year; MAIC ratio 1.72; 95% CI 1.31-2.27), but the rates of  vascular death were similar (1.83%/year vs. 1.53%/year; MAIC ratio 1.19; 95% CI  0.84-1.70). Sensitivity analyses weighted by different baseline characteristics  supported these results. CONCLUSION: The low rates of major bleeding and stroke in  XANTUS were consistent with results from ROCKET AF. All-cause death, but not  vascular death, was higher in XANTUS, as expected in an unselected real-world  population.","Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

This summary presents the perspective of Warwick Evidence, the  Evidence Review Group (ERG) appointed by the National Institute of Health and Care  Excellence (NICE) for the single technology appraisal of pembrolizumab for this  indication. Pembrolizumab is manufactured by Merck, Sharp and Dohme (MSD). The major  source of clinical effectiveness was the KEYNOTE-045 trial, where 542 patients  received either pembrolizumab or clinician's choice of docetaxel, paclitaxel or  vinflunine as a second-line treatment. No indirect treatment comparison was  performed. The clinical effectiveness was assessed using hazard ratios for overall  survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of the intention-to-treat (ITT)  population, together with the subpopulations positive for programmed cell death 1  ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (combined positive score [CPS] ≥ 1%) and strongly  positive for PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 10%). In the ITT population, OS improved with  pembrolizumab (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91) while PFS outcomes showed no difference  (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81-1.19). Pembrolizumab demonstrated a better safety profile than  its combined comparators, with fewer patients experiencing adverse events (60.9 vs  90.2%). Similar results were observed in populations expressing PD-L1. MSD estimated  the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab using a de novo partitioned survival model.  The model had three health states: pre-progression, post-progression and death,  where OS and PFS estimates excluded patients who received vinflunine. The largest  uncertainty was over the selection of the parametric models used to extrapolate OS  and PFS and the time point for when to begin their extrapolation. The company  preferences for extrapolation were not well supported and the ERG disagreed with  their selection for OS. Utility values were also contentious, with the company  preferring to use pooled time-to-death-based utilities pooled across treatment arms,  whilst the ERG preferred pooled progression-based utilities. The company preferred  to use data from patients receiving vinflunine when calculating the utility values,  which the ERG disagreed with as this is not recommended treatment within the UK. The  company assumed a lifetime treatment effect for their model; however, the lack of  evidence made it difficult to confidently provide a realistic estimate of treatment  effect duration. Various durations were explored (3, 5 and 10 years). The first  appraisal committee meeting concluded that pembrolizumab was not cost effective,  largely due to uncertainty in the OS and PFS extrapolations. The company's second  submission included an additional 4 months follow-up to survival data. The company  in this new submission maintained their original assumptions in their base-case  analysis, changing only the choice of parametric curve for PFS. This change resulted  in the OS and PFS curves intersecting at 6 years in the pembrolizumab arm, at which  point PFS identically followed OS. This resulted in no patients in the  post-progression health state beyond this time point, and therefore, the majority of  pembrolizumab's benefit came from pre-progression survival. Given the unclear PFS  benefit, the ERG found this implausible and maintained their original base-case  model assumptions. Considerable uncertainty remained over the specification of the  extrapolations and the duration of treatment effect. Based on a new-value  proposition submitted by the company, the appraisal committee concluded that  pembrolizumab had plausible potential to be cost effective. Pembrolizumab was  referred for funding through the Cancer Drugs Fund, so that further data could be  collected with the aim of diminishing the outstanding uncertainties pertaining to  its clinical effectiveness.",NA,"Gallacher, Daniel Armoiry, Xavier Auguste, Peter Court, Rachel Mantopoulos, Theodoros Patterson, Jacoby De Santis, Maria Cresswell, Joanne Mistry, Hema",Gallacher D Armoiry X Auguste P Court R Mantopoulos T Patterson J De Santis M Cresswell J Mistry H,NA,"Warwick Evidence, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road,  Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK.

DESIGN: Systematic literature synthesis. DATA SOURCES:  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science.  STUDY SELECTION: English language papers that used indirect comparison meta-analytic  methods to study the efficacy or safety of three or more interventions, where at  least one was a drug. DATA EXTRACTION: The number of publications and authors was  plotted by year and type: methodological contribution, review or empirical  application. Author and methodological details were summarised for empirical  applications, and animated coauthorship networks were created to visualise  contributors by country and affiliation type (academia, industry, government or  other) over time. RESULTS: We identified 477 papers (74 methodological  contributions, 42 reviews and 361 empirical applications) by 1689 distinct authors  from 1997 to 2013. Prior to 2002, only three applications were published, with  contributions from the USA (n=2) and Canada (n=1). The number of applications  gradually increased annually with rapid uptake between 2011 and 2013 (n=254, 71%).  Early diffusion occurred primarily in Europe with the first application credited to  the UK in 2003. Application spread to other European countries in 2005, and may have  been supported by regulatory requirements for drug approval. By the end of 2013,  contributions included 49% credited to Europe (22% UK, 27% other), 37% credited to  North America (11% Canada, 26% USA) and 14% from other regions. CONCLUSION: Indirect  comparison meta-analytic methods are an important innovation for health research.  Although Canada and the USA were the first to apply these methods, Europe led their  diffusion. The increase in uptake of these methods may have been facilitated by  acceptance by regulatory agencies, which are calling for more comparative drug  effect data to assist in drug accessibility and reimbursement decisions.",© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

Comparative treatment effects were analysed by random effects NMA in the short term,  medium term and long term. Relative ranking of treatments was assessed by surface  under the cumulative ranking probabilities (0-100 scale). RESULTS: Thirty-one RCTs  (total n=2450 patients) were included. There was no evidence of inconsistency  detected between direct and indirect treatment comparisons in the networks, but  sparse data led to frequently wide CIs. Available evidence does not suggest that any  of the commonly used treatments for the management of PHP are better than any other,  although corticosteroid injections, alone or in combination with exercise, and ESWT  were ranked most likely to be effective for the management of short-term,  medium-term and long-term pain or function; placebo/sham/control appeared least  likely to be effective; and exercise appeared to only be beneficial for long-term  pain or function. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is equivocal regarding which  treatment is the most effective for the management of PHP. Given limited  understanding of long-term effects, there is need for large, methodologically robust  multicentre RCTs investigating and directly comparing commonly used treatments for  the management of PHP.

Head-to-head evidence is limited in  many disease areas, regularly resulting in disconnected evidence structures where a  large number of treatments are available. This is also the case in the evidence of  treatments for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: Randomised  controlled trials (RCTs) identified in a systematic literature review form two  disconnected evidence networks. Standard Bayesian NMA models are fitted to obtain  estimates of relative effects within each network. Observational evidence was  identified to fill the evidence gap. Single armed trials are matched to act as each  other's control group based on a distance metric derived from covariate information.  Uncertainty resulting from including this evidence is incorporated by analysing the  space of possible matches. RESULTS: Twenty five randomised controlled trials form  two disconnected evidence networks; 12 single armed observational studies are  considered for bridging between the networks. Five matches are selected to bridge  between the networks. While significant variation in the ranking is observed,  daratumumab in combination with dexamethasone and either lenalidomide or bortezomib,  as well as triple therapy of carfilzomib, ixazomib and elozumatab, in combination  with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, show the highest effects on progression free  survival, on average. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis shows how observational data can be  used to fill gaps in the existing networks of RCT evidence; allowing for the  indirect comparison of a large number of treatments, which could not be compared  otherwise. Additional uncertainty is accounted for by scenario analyses reducing the  risk of over confidence in interpretation of results.",NA,"Schmitz, Susanne Maguire, Áine Morris, James Ruggeri, Kai Haller, Elisa Kuhn, Isla Leahy, Joy Homer, Natalia Khan, Ayesha Bowden, Jack Buchanan, Vanessa O'Dwyer, Michael Cook, Gordon Walsh, Cathal",Schmitz S Maguire Á Morris J Ruggeri K Haller E Kuhn I Leahy J Homer N Khan A Bowden J Buchanan V O'Dwyer M Cook G Walsh C,ORCID: 0000-0003-4753-1709,"Department of Population Health, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen,  Luxembourg. susanne.schmitz@lih.lu.

A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to assess the comparative  efficacy of treatments among patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic  NSCLC. METHODS: Randomized trials of dabrafenib + trametinib, docetaxel, erlotinib,  nintedanib + docetaxel, nivolumab, pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, and best supportive  care as second-line or above treatments for advanced or metastatic NSCLC identified  in a systematic literature review were included in the NMA. Overall response rates  (ORRs) and disease control rates (DCRs) were compared using logit models;  progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared using  fractional polynomial hazards models. Dabrafenib + trametinib was linked into the  evidence network through a matching-adjusted indirect comparison versus nivolumab.  RESULTS: Ten trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the NMA.  Dabrafenib + trametinib, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab were associated with the  highest odds of achieving overall response (12.2, 1.2, and 0.7 times higher,  respectively, compared with docetaxel). Estimated DCR was higher for  dabrafenib + trametinib, nintedanib + docetaxel, and pemetrexed compared with other  treatments. Patients treated with dabrafenib + trametinib, nivolumab, and  pembrolizumab had the lowest hazards of disease progression or death during  follow-up (72, 61, and 29% lower hazard of progression at 6 months; 61, 48, and 46%  lower hazard of death at 1 year, respectively, compared with docetaxel). CONCLUSION:  Dabrafenib + trametinib, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab were associated with higher  ORR and prolonged PFS and OS compared with chemotherapy in previously treated  advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

In this work, we aimed to assess the relative treatment  effects of empagliflozin versus sitagliptin and saxagliptin (dipeptidyl peptidase-4  (DPP-4) inhibitors) on cardiovascular-related outcomes in patients with T2DM.  METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify clinical trials  assessing cardiovascular-related outcomes for sitagliptin-, saxagliptin-, and  empagliflozin-treated patients with T2DM. A network meta-analysis of indirect  treatment comparisons was conducted in a Bayesian framework. Hazard ratios (HR) and  95% credible intervals (CrI) were computed for six cardiovascular-related outcomes  to estimate the relative efficacies of these agents. RESULTS: Empagliflozin showed a  statistically significant superiority over saxagliptin (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.46-0.80)  and sitagliptin (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.46-0.79) to reduce the risk for  cardiovascular-related mortality. For all-cause mortality, empagliflozin showed a  statistically significant risk reduction compared to saxagliptin (HR 0.61; 95% CrI  0.49-0.76) and sitagliptin (HR 0.67; 95% CrI 0.54-0.83). A similar pattern was  observed in the risk reduction for hospitalization due to heart failure, where  empagliflozin was found to be statistically significantly superior to saxagliptin  (HR 0.51; 95% CrI 0.37-0.70) and sitagliptin (HR 0.65; 95% CrI 0.47-0.90).  Empagliflozin was not statistically significantly different to sitagliptin and  saxagliptin with regard to the risk of a composite endpoint composed of death,  stroke or myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: In this indirect comparison to the  DPP-4 inhibitors saxagliptin and sitagliptin, empagliflozin significantly lowered  the risk of cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause mortality and  hospitalizations due to heart failure.

Population  differences can lead to biased results by classical indirect treatment comparison  (ITC). Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) aims to correct these  differences. We compared RIBO and PALBO in hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal  growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer using MAIC. METHODS:  Patient-level data were available for RIBO (MONALEESA-2), while only published  summary data were available for PALBO (PALOMA-2). Weights were assigned to  MONALEESA-2 patient data such that mean baseline characteristics matched those  reported for PALOMA-2; the resulting matched cohort was used in comparisons. Limited  by the results reported in PALOMA-2, progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary  comparison. Cox regression models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios  (HRs) for PFS, before indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was performed with 95%  confidence intervals. An exploratory analysis was performed similarly for overall  survival using earlier PALBO data (PALOMA-1). Grade 3/4 adverse events were also  compared. RESULTS: Racial characteristics, prior chemotherapy setting, and the  extent of metastasis were the most imbalanced baseline characteristics. The  unadjusted PFS HRs were 0.556 (0.429, 0.721) for RIBO+LET versus LET alone and 0.580  (0.460, 0.720) for PALBO+LET versus LET alone. MAIC adjustment resulted in an HR of  0.524 (0.406, 0.676) for RIBO+LET versus LET. PFS ITC using unadjusted trial data  produced an HR of 0.959 (0.681, 1.350) for RIBO versus PALBO, or 0.904 (0.644,  1.268) with MAIC. Unadjusted overall survival HR of RIBO versus PALBO was 0.918  (0.492, 1.710); while exploratory MAIC was 0.839 (0.440, 1.598). ITC of grade 3/4  adverse events yielded a risk ratio of 0.806 (0.604, 1.076).

A STOPCAP systematic review and network meta-analysis.",S0923-7534(19)34540-5 [pii] 10.1093/annonc/mdy071 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Our prior Systemic Treatment Options for Cancer of the Prostate  systematic reviews showed improved survival for men with metastatic hormone-naive  prostate cancer when abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone/prednisone (AAP) or  docetaxel (Doc), but not zoledronic acid (ZA), were added to androgen-deprivation  therapy (ADT). Trial evidence also suggests a benefit of combining celecoxib (Cel)  with ZA and ADT. To establish the optimal treatments, a network meta-analysis (NMA)  was carried out based on aggregate data (AD) from all available studies. METHODS:  Overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival data from completed Systemic  Treatment Options for Cancer of the Prostate reviews of Doc, ZA and AAP and from  recent trials of ZA and Cel contributed to this comprehensive AD-NMA. The primary  outcome was OS. Correlations between treatment comparisons within one multi-arm,  multi-stage trial were estimated from control-arm event counts. Network consistency  and a common heterogeneity variance were assumed. RESULTS: We identified 10  completed trials which had closed to recruitment, and one trial in which recruitment  was ongoing, as eligible for inclusion. Results are based on six trials including  6204 men (97% of men randomised in all completed trials). Network estimates of  effects on OS were consistent with reported comparisons with ADT alone for AAP  [hazard ration (HR) = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.71], Doc (HR = 0.77,  95% CI 0.68-0.87), ZA + Cel (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.97), ZA + Doc (HR = 0.79, 95%  CI 0.66-0.94), Cel (HR = 0.94 95% CI 0.75-1.17) and ZA (HR = 0.90 95% CI 0.79-1.03).  The effect of ZA + Cel is consistent with the additive effects of the individual  treatments. Results suggest that AAP has the highest probability of being the most  effective treatment both for OS (94% probability) and failure-free survival (100%  probability). Doc was the second-best treatment of OS (35% probability).  CONCLUSIONS: Uniquely, we have included all available results and appropriately  accounted for inclusion of multi-arm, multi-stage trials in this AD-NMA. Our results  support the use of AAP or Doc with ADT in men with metastatic hormone-naive prostate  cancer. AAP appears to be the most effective treatment, but it is not clear to what  extent and whether this is due to a true increased benefit with AAP or the variable  features of the individual trials. To fully account for patient variability across  trials, changes in prognosis or treatment effects over time and the potential impact  of treatment on progression, a network meta-analysis based on individual participant  data is in development.",NA,"Vale, C L Fisher, D J White, I R Carpenter, J R Burdett, S Clarke, N W Fizazi, K Gravis, G James, N D Mason, M D Parmar, M K B Rydzewska, L H Sweeney, C J Spears, M R Sydes, M R Tierney, J F",Vale CL Fisher DJ White IR Carpenter JR Burdett S Clarke NW Fizazi K Gravis G James ND Mason MD Parmar MKB Rydzewska LH Sweeney CJ Spears MR Sydes MR Tierney JF,NA,"MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, London.

Pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint  inhibitor, is one possible treatment solution for this population. RESEARCH METHODS:  The objective of this study was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) with  standard of care (SOC) versus pembrolizumab in previously BV treated RRcHL patients.  A systematic literature review identified one observational study of SOC that was  suitable for comparison with KEYNOTE-087, the principal trial of pembrolizumab in  this population. Both naïve and population-adjusted (using outcomes regression)  pairwise indirect comparisons were conducted. The primary analysis included all  patients who had failed BV, with a secondary analysis conducted including only those  known to have failed BV that was part of definitive treatment. RESULTS: In the  primary analysis, SOC was inferior to pembrolizumab in both the unadjusted  comparison (HR 5.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.56-7.01]) and the adjusted  comparison (HR 6.35 [95% CI 4.04-9.98]). These HRs increased to 5.16 (95% CI  3.61-7.38) and 6.56 (95% CI 4.01-10.72), respectively, in the secondary analysis.

METHODS: Targeted reviews of PubMed, the National  Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Highly Specialised Technologies  (HST), and the Scottish Medicines Consortium's (SMC's) ultra-orphan submissions were  performed. RESULTS: A total of 19 PubMed studies, 3 published NICE HSTs, and 11  ultra-orphan SMC submissions were eligible for inclusion. In rare diseases, a number  of different factors may affect the model's ability to comply with good practice  recommendations. Many products for the treatment of rare diseases have an incomplete  efficacy and safety profile at product launch. In addition, there is often limited  available natural history and epidemiology data. Information on the direct and  indirect cost burden of an orphan disease also may be limited, making it difficult  to estimate the potential economic benefit of treatment. These challenges can  prevent accurate estimation of a new product's benefits in relation to costs.  Approaches that can address such challenges include using patient and/or clinician  feedback to inform model assumptions; data from disease analogues; epidemiological  techniques, such as matching-adjusted indirect comparison; and long-term data  collection. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling in rare diseases is often challenging; however, a  number of approaches are available to support the development of model structures  and the collation of input parameters and to manage uncertainty.",Copyright © 2018 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  (ISPOR).

Such metrics have value in  measuring the outcomes of conventional therapies, but may not be the most  appropriate for new therapies. Immuno-oncology therapies offer a new approach to  treating cancer by stimulating patients' immune systems to fight cancer. The value  of these novel therapies has so far been assessed with traditional metrics, but the  different ways in which immuno-oncology therapies work can mean the full value is  not captured. Immuno-oncology therapies can produce longer survival times but this  effect can be delayed or even preceded by an apparent phase of progression, which  median survival or response rates may not reflect. This paper discusses a range of  traditional and alternative metrics and their benefits or disadvantages in measuring  the effects of immuno-oncology therapies, using examples of several novel drugs as  case studies.","© 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Chan, E Quinn, C Hirji, I Hillengass, J Anderson, K Oukessou, A Davis, C",Chan E Quinn C Hirji I Hillengass J Anderson K Oukessou A Davis C,NA,"PRMA Consulting, Linea House, Ancells Business Park, Harvest Crescent, Fleet, GU51  2UZ, UK.

In an  intention-to-treat analysis including 237 patients, the median progression-free  survival (PFS) was 25 months. The presence of del(17p), unmutated IGHV and advanced  stage were associated with a shorter PFS at multivariate analysis. The median  time-to-next treatment was 31.3 months. Front-line treatment with a  chemoimmunotherapy regimen was the only predictive factor for a shorter time to next  treatment at multivariate analysis. The median overall survival (OS) was 74.5  months. Advanced disease stage (i.e. Rai stage III-IV or Binet stage C) and  resistant disease were the only parameters significantly associated with a shorter  OS.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: As a joint initiative between the British  Society of Interventional Radiologists, the British Association of Urological  Surgeons and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, we conducted the  UK Register of Prostate Embolization (UK-ROPE) study, which recruited 305 patients  across 17 UK urological/interventional radiology centres, 216 of whom underwent PAE  and 89 of whom underwent TURP. The primary outcomes were International Prostate  Symptom Score (IPSS) improvement in the PAE group at 12 months post-procedure, and  complication data post-PAE. We also aimed to compare IPSS score improvements between  the PAE and TURP groups, using non-inferiority analysis on propensity-score-matched  patient pairs. The clinical results and urological measurements were performed at  clinical sites. IPSS and other questionnaire-based results were mailed by patients  directly to the trial unit managing the study. All data were uploaded centrally to  the UK-ROPE study database. RESULTS: The results showed that PAE was clinically  effective, producing a median 10-point IPSS improvement from baseline at 12 months  post-procedure. PAE did not appear to be as effective as TURP, which produced a  median 15-point IPSS score improvement at 12 months post-procedure. These findings  are further supported by the propensity score analysis, in which we formed 65  closely matched pairs of patients who underwent PAE and patients who underwent TURP.  In terms of IPSS and quality-of-life (QoL) improvement, there was no evidence of PAE  being non-inferior to TURP. Patients in the PAE group had a statistically  significant improvement in maximum urinary flow rate and prostate volume reduction  at 12 months post-procedure. PAE had a reoperation rate of 5% before 12 months and  15% after 12 months (20% total rate), and a low complication rate. Of 216 patients,  one had sepsis, one required a blood transfusion, four had local arterial dissection  and four had a groin haematoma. Two patients had non-target embolization that  presented as self-limiting penile ulcers. Additional patient-reported outcomes, pain  levels and return to normal activities were very encouraging for PAE. Seventy-one  percent of PAE cases were performed as outpatient or day cases. In contrast, 80% of  TURP cases required at least 1 night of hospital stay, and the majority required 2  nights. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that PAE provides a clinically and  statistically significant improvement in symptoms and QoL, although some of these  improvements were greater in the TURP arm. The safety profile and quicker return to  normal activities may be seen as highly beneficial by patients considering PAE as an  alternative treatment to TURP, with the concomitant advantages of reduced length of  hospital stay and need for admission after PAE. PAE is an advanced embolization  technique demanding a high level of expertise, and should be performed by  experienced interventional radiologists who have been trained and proctored  appropriately. The use of cone-beam computed tomography is encouraged to improve  operator confidence and minimize non-target embolizations. The place of PAE in the  care pathway is between that of drugs and surgery, allowing the clinician to tailor  treatment to individual patients' symptoms, requirements and anatomical variation.",© 2018 The Authors BJU International published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of  BJU International.,"Ray, Alistair F Powell, John Speakman, Mark J Longford, Nicholas T DasGupta, Ranan Bryant, Timothy Modi, Sachin Dyer, Jonathan Harris, Mark Carolan-Rees, Grace Hacking, Nigel",Ray AF Powell J Speakman MJ Longford NT DasGupta R Bryant T Modi S Dyer J Harris M Carolan-Rees G Hacking N,ORCID: 0000-0001-6728-6187,"Cedar, Cardiff University/Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, Cardiff, UK.

METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to  inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due  to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive  care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and  adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The  ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios  for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs);  uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian)  Intervals. RESULTS: Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were  relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly  different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83-1.28) or enzalutamide (HR =  0.88; 95% CI = 0.69-1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis.  Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01-10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI =  1.41-75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03-10.09) were more likely to  occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was  higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14-206.40).  Frequentist analyses produced similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity of clinical  studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results  must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results  from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles.  As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and  patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and  real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the  beneficial effects of these therapies.",NA,"Fryzek, Jon P Reichert, Heidi Summers, Nicholas Townes, Lindsay Deuson, Robert Alexander, Dominik D Vanderpuye-Orgle, Jackie",Fryzek JP Reichert H Summers N Townes L Deuson R Alexander DD Vanderpuye-Orgle J,ORCID: 0000-0003-0529-0994,"EpidStat Institute, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.

The efficacy of  vaginal progesterone has been challenged after publication of the OPPTIMUM study.  However, this has been resolved by an individual patient-data meta-analysis (Am J  Obstet Gynecol. 2018;218:161-180). OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of vaginal  progesterone and cerclage in preventing preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes  in women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a  midtrimester sonographic short cervix. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and  CINAHL (from their inception to March 2018); Cochrane databases, bibliographies, and  conference proceedings. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials  comparing vaginal progesterone to placebo/no treatment or cerclage to no cerclage in  women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a  sonographic cervical length <25 mm. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Updated  systematic review and adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis of vaginal  progesterone vs cerclage using placebo/no cerclage as the common comparator. The  primary outcomes were preterm birth <35 weeks of gestation and perinatal mortality.  Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS:  Five trials comparing vaginal progesterone vs placebo (265 women) and 5 comparing  cerclage vs no cerclage (504 women) were included. Vaginal progesterone, compared to  placebo, significantly reduced the risk of preterm birth <35 and <32 weeks of  gestation, composite perinatal morbidity/mortality, neonatal sepsis, composite  neonatal morbidity, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (RRs from 0.29  to 0.68). Cerclage, compared to no cerclage, significantly decreased the risk of  preterm birth <37, <35, <32, and <28 weeks of gestation, composite perinatal  morbidity/mortality, and birthweight <1500 g (RRs from 0.64 to 0.70). Adjusted  indirect comparison meta-analyses did not show statistically significant differences  between vaginal progesterone and cerclage in the reduction of preterm birth or  adverse perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSION: Vaginal progesterone and cerclage are  equally effective for preventing preterm birth and improving perinatal outcomes in  women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a  midtrimester sonographic short cervix.

However, summarising the evidence using  traditional pairwise meta-analyses does not allow the inclusion of data from  treatments that have not been compared head to head. Exclusion of such comparisons  could impact the precision of pooled estimates in a meta-analysis. Hence, to address  the challenge of whether aspirin alone or in addition to another antithrombotic  agent is a more effective regimen to improve SVG patency, a network meta-analysis  (NMA) is necessary. The objectives of this study are to synthesise the available  evidence on antithrombotic agents (or their combination) and estimate the treatment  effects among direct and indirect treatment comparisons on SVGF and major adverse  cardiovascular events, and to generate a treatment ranking according to their  efficacy and safety outcomes. METHODS: We will perform a systematic review of RCTs  evaluating antithrombotic agents in patients undergoing CABG. A comprehensive  English literature search will be conducted using electronic databases and grey  literature resources to identify published and unpublished articles. Two individuals  will independently and in duplicate screen potential studies, assess the eligibility  of potential studies and extract data. Risk of bias and quality of evidence will  also be evaluated independently and in duplicate. We will investigate the data to  ensure its suitability for NMA, including adequacy of the outcome data and  transitivity of treatment effects. We plan to estimate the pooled direct, indirect  and the mixed effects for all antithrombotic agents using a NMA. ETHICS AND  DISSEMINATION: Due to the nature of the study, there are no ethical concerns nor  informed consent required. We anticipate that this NMA will be the first to  simultaneously assess the relative effects of multiple antithrombotic agents in  patients undergoing CABG. The results of this NMA will inform clinicians, patients  and guideline developers the best available evidence on comparative effects benefits  of antithrombotic agents after CABG while considering the side effect profile to  support future clinical decision-making. We will disseminate the results of our  systematic review and NMA through a peer-reviewed journal.

The network  meta-analysis method extends this to multiple treatments which are assessed  simultaneously. Currently, there exist Bayesian and multivariate modelling  approaches to these analyses, but these are computationally intensive and rely on  assumptions that may not be valid in practice. Here we introduce a generalized  pairwise modelling (GPM) framework for network meta-analysis, so named as it is  based on the repeated application of adjusted indirect comparisons, also known as  the Bucher method. The validity of this method hinges on the sufficient similarity  of the common control node (transitivity), and for the application in the GPM  framework this requirement extends to all common nodes used to make an indirect  comparison estimate. Apart from the assumption of sufficient similarity, the GPM  framework assumes only standard arithmetic and statistical rules making it more  robust when compared with existing methods for network meta-analysis.

The Association of British  Neurologists guidelines currently recommend two infusion therapies, alemtuzumab and  natalizumab, to treat high disease activity relapsing remitting MS (HDA-RRMS). This  analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets in HDA-RRMS compared  with alemtuzumab and natalizumab, from the perspective of the National Health  Service (NHS) in England. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model with 11  health states (10 Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] plus death) was developed.  Transition matrices from the British Columbia registry were used to model the  natural history of EDSS. The treatment effect on EDSS was modelled using hazard  ratios for 6-month confirmed disability progression from an indirect treatment  comparison (ITC). Relapses and drug-related adverse events were modeled via  annualized relapse rates and event probabilities, with associated costs and  quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. Utilities were derived from trials and the  literature, and costs from NHS and literature sources. Uncertainty was assessed via  probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Cladribine tablets  were dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) vs alemtuzumab and natalizumab  in pairwise comparisons, and the dominant strategy in fully incremental analyses.  Incremental cost was driven largely by drug acquisition and administration costs,  and incremental QALY gain largely by differences in delayed EDSS progression.  Cladribine tablets had a 93% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of  GBP 30,000 per QALY gained, and remained dominant across the scenario analyses  tested. The greatest influence on results was the treatment effect on disability  progression derived from the ITC. LIMITATIONS: Uncertainty over the efficacy of DMT  beyond trial durations. In line with other comparative effectiveness analyses, the  network meta-analysis informing this cost-effectiveness analysis was associated with  a degree of uncertainty. No treatment switching analyses were undertaken.  CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine tablets are a cost-effective alternative to alemtuzumab and  natalizumab in the treatment of HDA-RRMS from the perspective of the NHS in England.",NA,"Hettle, Robert Harty, Gerard Wong, Schiffon L",Hettle R Harty G Wong SL,NA,"a Parexel Access Consulting, Parexel International , Uxbridge , UK. b MERCK , Feltham , UK. c EMD Serono Inc , Billerica , MA , USA.",eng,NA,Journal Article,20180416,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,IM,NOTNLM,Cladribine tablets alemtuzumab cost-effectiveness multiple sclerosis natalizumab,2018/04/06 06:00,2018/11/27 06:00,2018/04/06 06:00,2018/04/06 06:00 [pubmed] 2018/11/27 06:00 [medline] 2018/04/06 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/13696998.2018.1461630 [doi],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2018 Jul;21(7):676-686. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2018.1461630.

In the absence of direct randomized controlled trial  (RCT) data, matching-adjusted indirect comparison can estimate the comparative  effectiveness in anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naïve populations. METHODS:  Individual patient data from the FUTURE 2 RCT (secukinumab vs. placebo; N = 299)  were adjusted to match baseline characteristics of the ADEPT RCT (adalimumab vs.  placebo; N = 313). Logistic regression determined adjustment weights for age, body  weight, sex, race, methotrexate use, psoriasis affecting ≥ 3% of body surface area,  Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability  Index score, presence of dactylitis and enthesitis, and previous anti-TNF therapy.  Recalculated secukinumab outcomes were compared with adalimumab outcomes at weeks 12  (placebo-adjusted), 16, 24, and 48 (nonplacebo-adjusted). RESULTS: After matching,  the effective sample size for FUTURE 2 was 101. Week 12 American College of  Rheumatology (ACR) response rates were not significantly different between  secukinumab and adalimumab. Week 16 ACR 20 and 50 response rates were higher for  secukinumab 150 mg than for adalimumab (P = 0.017, P = 0.033), as was ACR 50 for  secukinumab 300 mg (P = 0.030). Week 24 ACR 20 and 50 were higher for secukinumab  150 mg than for adalimumab (P = 0.001, P = 0.019), as was ACR 20 for secukinumab  300 mg (P = 0.048). Week 48 ACR 20 was higher for secukinumab 150 and 300 mg than  for adalimumab (P = 0.002, P = 0.027), as was ACR 50 for secukinumab 300 mg  (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: In our analysis, patients with PsA receiving secukinumab  were more likely to achieve higher ACR responses through 1 year (weeks 16-48) than  those treated with adalimumab. Although informative, these observations rely on a  subgroup of patients from FUTURE 2 and thus should be considered interim until the  ongoing head-to-head RCT EXCEED can validate these findings.

The Study to Assess  Long-term Opioid Maintenance Effectiveness (SALOME) randomized controlled trial  provided evidence that injectable hydromorphone is non-inferior to diacetylmorphine.  The current study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of hydromorphone directly  with diacetylmorphine and indirectly with methadone maintenance treatment. DESIGN: A  within-trial analysis was conducted using the patient level data from the 6-month,  double-blind, non-inferiority SALOME trial. A life-time analysis extrapolated costs  and outcomes using a decision analytical cohort model. The model incorporated data  from a previous trial to include an indirect comparison to methadone maintenance.  SETTING: A supervised clinic in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A  total of 202 long-term street opioid injectors who had at least two attempts at  treatment, including one with methadone (or other substitution), were randomized to  hydromorphone (n = 100) or diacetylmorphine (n = 102). MEASUREMENTS: We measured the  utilization of drugs, visits to health professionals, hospitalizations, criminal  activity, mortality and quality of life. This enabled us to estimate incremental  costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness ratios from a  societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses considered different sources of evidence,  assumptions and perspectives. FINDINGS: The within-trial analysis found  hydromorphone provided similar QALYs to diacetylmorphine [0.377, 95% confidence  interval (CI) = 0.361-0.393 versus 0.375, 95% CI = 0.357-0.391], but accumulated  marginally greater costs [$49 830 ($28 401-73 637) versus $34 320 ($21 780-55 998)].  The life-time analysis suggested that both diacetylmorphine and hydromorphone  provide more benefits than methadone [8.4 (7.4-9.5) and 8.3 (7.2-9.5) versus 7.4  (6.5-8.3) QALYs] at lower cost [$1.01 million ($0.6-1.59 million) and $1.02 million  ($0.72-1.51 million) versus $1.15 million ($0.71-1.84 million)]. CONCLUSIONS: In  patients with severe opioid use disorder enrolled into the SALOME trial, injectable  hydromorphone provided similar outcomes to injectable diacetylmorphine. Modelling  outcomes during a patient's life-time suggested that injectable hydromorphone might  provide greater benefit than methadone alone and may be cost-saving, with drug costs  being offset by costs saved from reduced involvement in criminal activity.",© 2018 Society for the Study of Addiction.,"Bansback, Nick Guh, Daphne Oviedo-Joekes, Eugenia Brissette, Suzanne Harrison, Scott Janmohamed, Amin Krausz, Michael MacDonald, Scott Marsh, David C Schechter, Martin T Anis, Aslam H",Bansback N Guh D Oviedo-Joekes E Brissette S Harrison S Janmohamed A Krausz M MacDonald S Marsh DC Schechter MT Anis AH,ORCID: 0000-0002-1510-3462,"Centre for Health Evaluation and Outcome Sciences, Providence Health Care, St Paul's  Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Currently available epidemiologic data suggest that  non-herbal tea consumption may reduce OC risk, but these evidences are inconsistent.  A comprehensive literature search for observational epidemiologic studies reporting  associations between non-herbal tea consumption and OC risk was conducted in  electronic databases. A random-effects model was used to synthesize effect measures  in binary meta-analysis, and adjusted indirect comparison was used to compare  whether there was a difference in effects between green tea (GT) and black tea (BT).  Both linear and non-linear models were used to explore the dose-response  relationship. Fourteen studies were included, and we obtained an inverse and  significant pooled estimate in binary meta-analysis [risk ratio (RR)pool = 0.76, 95%  confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.95, PCochran < 0.001, I2 = 81.5%]. No publication  bias was identified in binary meta-analysis. In binary meta-analysis stratified by  tea types, we observed a significant association for GT (RRpool = 0.64, 95% CI  0.45-0.90, PCochran = 0.071, I2 = 53.6%), but not BT (RRpool = 0.85, 95% CI  0.65-1.12, PCochran = 0.007, I2 = 65.9%). Indirect comparison, which treated BT as  the reference, showed an inverse but non-significant association (RRGT versus BT =  0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.15). Both linear and non-linear models found that OC risk  decreased as the consumption levels of total non-herbal tea increased. However, the  dose-response relationship was stronger for GT when compared with BT. Our results  suggest that non-herbal tea, especially GT, is associated with a reduced risk of OC.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence  of progression in radiographic adjacent-level degeneration (ΔALD) from preoperative  assessment to 5 years after total disc replacement (TDR) and the relationship of  these changes with range of motion and clinical adjacent-level disease. A secondary  objective was to compare adjacent-level degeneration (ALD) outcomes between TDR and  fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Fusion is associated with high rates of ALD in  symptomatic lumbar disc degeneration. TDR may reduce this risk. METHODS: In total,  175 patients with single-level, symptomatic, lumbar disc degeneration who had  received activL or ProDisc-L and had a preoperative and 5-year postoperative  radiograph available were included. Over 5-year follow-up, ΔALD was defined as an  increase in ALD of ≥1 grade and clinical ALD was defined as surgical treatment at  the level adjacent to an index TDR. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were  conducted to compare ALD outcomes after TDR (current trial) with those after fusion  (published trial). RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, 9.7% (17/175) of TDR patients had  ΔALD at the superior level. In patients with preoperative ALD at the superior level,  most (88% [23/26]) showed no radiographic progression over 5 years. The rate of  clinical ALD was 2.3% (4/175) and none of these patients had ALD at baseline. For  each degree of range of motion gained at the TDR level, there was a consistent  decrease in the percentage of patients with ΔALD. After matching and adjustment of  baseline characteristics, TDR had a significantly lower likelihood of ΔALD than  fusion (odds ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.13, 0.76). CONCLUSION: The rates  of ΔALD and clinical ALD in this TDR population were similar to those previously  reported in the literature for TDR at 5-year follow-up. TDR had a significantly  lower rate of ΔALD than fusion.

RESULTS: The method was applied in  a case study example in radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer  (RR-DTC) patients, comparing lenvatinib to sorafenib. For every two RR-DTC patients  treated with lenvatinib instead of sorafenib, one fewer would have progressed and  for every eight RR-DTC patients treated with lenvatinib instead of sorafenib, one  fewer would have died.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost  effectiveness of nivolumab monotherapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma  patients in England. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to  estimate the lifetime costs and benefits of nivolumab versus ipilimumab and  dacarbazine for BRAF mutation-negative patients and versus ipilimumab, dabrafenib,  and vemurafenib for BRAF mutation-positive patients. Covariate-adjusted parametric  curves for time to progression, pre-progression survival, and post-progression  survival were fitted based on patient-level data from two trials and long-term  ipilimumab survival data. Indirect treatment comparisons between nivolumab,  ipilimumab, and dacarbazine were informed by these covariate-adjusted parametric  curves, controlling for differences in patient characteristics. Kaplan-Meier data  from the literature were digitised and used to fit progression-free and overall  survival curves for dabrafenib and vemurafenib. Patient utilities and resource use  data were based on trial data or the literature. Patients are assumed to receive  nivolumab until there is no further clinical benefit, assumed to be the first of  progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or 2 years of treatment. RESULTS:  Nivolumab is the most cost-effective treatment option in BRAF mutation-negative and  mutation-positive patients, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £24,483  and £17,362 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. The model results are most  sensitive to assumptions regarding treatment duration for nivolumab and the  parameters of the fitted parametric survival curves.

One percent silver sulfadiazine has been utilized widely in the management  of burns and newer silver dressings are on the market, including nanocrystalline  silver dressings, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressings, and silver-impregnated  foam dressings. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the cost effectiveness of  the newer silver dressings using clinical data from an indirect treatment comparison  using silver sulfadiazine as the baseline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision  analytic model was developed from a US payer's perspective for burn patients with a  total body surface area of < 20%. Outcomes were length of stay, infections and  incidence of surgical procedures, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost.  RESULTS: The meta-analysis reported a statistically significant reduction in length  of hospital stay and clinically important reductions in infections and incidence of  surgical procedures in favor of the silver barrier dressing compared with other  silver dressings. The estimated QALYs were 0.970 versus 0.969 versus 0.969 and mean  cost per patient was $15,892, $23,799, and $24,269 for the nanocrystalline silver  dressing, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, and silver-impregnated foam  dressing, respectively. The analysis showed the nanocrystalline silver dressing to  be a dominant strategy (less costly with better outcomes). These findings were  robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: According to data from an  indirect treatment comparison, this analysis suggests that nanocrystalline silver  dressing is the most cost-effective silver delivery system. Prospective head-to-head  research on the costs and outcomes of these silver delivery systems in this patient  population is necessary to validate the results of this economic evaluation.",NA,"Nherera, Leo Trueman, Paul Roberts, Christopher Berg, Leena",Nherera L Trueman P Roberts C Berg L,NA,"Smith & Nephew Advanced Wound Management, Hull, UK.

In lieu of  head-to-head randomized control trials, we performed an adjusted indirect treatment  comparison (ITC) meta-analysis to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of  different METs, Solitaire+IVtPA and Penumbra+IVtPA in AIS patients. METHODS AND  FINDINGS: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  and Embase from January 1, 2005 through April 1, 2017 for RCTs in AIS patients,  comparing a single MET+IVtPA to IVtPA alone and reporting shift in ordinal modified  Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days. Secondary endpoints included 90 day mortality  and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). Endpoints were pooled using  traditional random effects meta-analysis methods, producing odds ratios and 95%  confidence intervals. Adjusted ITCs using pooled estimates were then performed.  Three studies (SWIFT PRIME, EXTEND-IA, THERAPY) were included; two evaluating the  Solitaire stent retriever and one the Penumbra system. Traditional meta-analysis  demonstrated that each MET+IVtPA resulted in increased odds of improving ordinal mRS  score vs. IVtPA alone, but did not alter the odds of death or sICH.

This paper  focusses on the three phases of CML: the chronic phase (CP), the accelerated phase  (AP) and the blast crisis phase (BP). The School of Health and Related Research  Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as  the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents the critical  review of the company's submission by the ERG and the outcome of the NICE guidance.  Clinical evidence for ponatinib was derived from a phase II, industry-sponsored,  single-arm, open-label, multicentre, non-comparative study. Despite the limited  evidence and potential for biases, this study demonstrated that ponatinib was likely  to be an effective treatment (in terms of major cytogenetic response and major  haematological response) with an acceptable safety profile for patients with CML.  Given the absence of any head-to-head studies comparing ponatinib with other  relevant comparators, the company undertook a matching-adjusted indirect comparison  (MAIC) of ponatinib with bosutinib. The approach was only used for patients with  CP-CML because comprehensive data were not available for the AP- or BP-CML groups to  allow the matching technique to be used. Despite the uncertainty about the MAIC  approach, ponatinib was considered likely to offer advantages over bosutinib in the  third-line setting, particularly for complete cytogenetic response. The company  developed two health economic models to assess the cost effectiveness of ponatinib  for the treatment of patients in CP-CML or in advanced CML (AP- or BP-CML, which  were modelled separately). The company did not adequately explore the uncertainty in  the survivor functions. As a result, the ERG believed the uncertainty in the  decision problem was underestimated. Exploratory analyses undertaken by the ERG  produced the following results for ponatinib. In CP-CML, from £18,246 to £27,667 per  quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with best supportive care (BSC),  from £19,680 to £37,381 per QALY gained compared with bosutinib and from £18,279 per  QALY gained to dominated compared with allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT).  In AP-CML, the cost per QALY gained for ponatinib ranged from £7123 to £17,625  compared with BSC, and from dominating to £61,896 per QALY gained compared with  allo-SCT. In BP-CML, the cost effectiveness of ponatinib ranged from £5033 per QALY  gained to dominated compared with allo-SCT, although it was likely to be at the more  favourable end of this range, and dominant in all scenarios compared with BSC. The  NICE appraisal committee concluded that ponatinib is a cost-effective use of NHS  resources in the considered population, subject to the company providing the agreed  discount in the Patient Access Scheme.",NA,"Pandor, Abdullah Stevenson, Matt Stevens, John James, Marrissa Martyn-St Hamilton, Jean Byrne, Jenny Rudin, Claudius Rawdin, Andrew Wong, Ruth",Pandor A Stevenson M Stevens J James MM Hamilton J Byrne J Rudin C Rawdin A Wong R,ORCID: 0000-0002-3099-9877,"School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S1 4DA,  UK.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health  states (stable disease, progressive disease, death) was developed over a 20-year  time horizon. Ceritinib's efficacy inputs (progression-free and overall survival)  were estimated from ASCEND-4; parametric survival models extrapolated data beyond  the trial period. The relative efficacy of ceritinib vs chemotherapy was obtained  from ASCEND-4, the relative efficacy of ceritinib vs crizotinib was estimated using  a matching-adjusted indirect comparison based on ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. Drug  acquisition, treatment administration, adverse event management, and medical costs  were obtained from publicly available databases and the literature, and inflated to  2016 US dollars. Treatment-specific stable-state utilities were derived from trials  and progressive-state utility from the literature. Incremental costs per  quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated for ceritinib vs each comparator.  Cost-effectiveness was assessed based on US willingness-to-pay thresholds.  Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test model  robustness. RESULTS: In the base case, first-line ceritinib was associated with  total direct costs of $299,777 and 3.28 QALYs (from 4.61 life years gained [LYG])  over 20 years. First-line crizotinib and chemotherapy were associated with 2.73 and  2.41 QALYs, 3.92 and 3.53 LYG, and $263,172 and $228,184 total direct costs,  respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained was $66,064 for ceritinib vs  crizotinib and $81,645 for ceritinib vs chemotherapy. In the first 2 years following  treatment initiation, ceritinib dominated crizotinib by conferring greater health  benefits at reduced total costs. Results were robust to deterministic and  probabilistic sensitivity analyses. LIMITATIONS: In the absence of head-to-head  trials, an indirect comparison method was used.

METHODS: The Swedish  Institute for Health Economics cohort model for T2D was used to compare liraglutide  and lixisenatide (both added to basal insulin), with a societal perspective and with  comparative treatment effects derived by indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Drug  prices were 2016 values, and all other costs 2015 values. The cost-effectiveness of  IDegLira (fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide) versus  lixisenatide plus basal insulin was also assessed, under different sets of  assumptions. RESULTS: From the ITC, decreases in HbA1c were -1.32% and -0.43% with  liraglutide and lixisenatide, respectively; decreases in BMI were -1.29 and -0.65  kg/m2, respectively. An estimated 2348 cases of retinopathy, 265 of neuropathy and  991 of nephropathy would be avoided with liraglutide compared with lixisenatide in a  cohort of 10,000 patients aged over 40 years. In the base-case analysis, total  direct costs were higher with liraglutide than lixisenatide, but costs associated  with complications were lower. The cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for  liraglutide added to basal insulin was SEK30,802. Base-case findings were robust in  sensitivity analyses, except when glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) differences for  liraglutide added to basal insulin were abolished, suggesting these benefits were  driving the cost/QALY. With liraglutide 1.2 mg instead of liraglutide 1.8 mg  (adjusted for efficacy and cost), liraglutide added to basal insulin was dominant  over lixisenatide 20μg.IDegLira was dominant versus lixisenatide plus basal insulin  when a defined daily dose was used in the model. CONCLUSIONS: The costs/QALY for  liraglutide, 1.8 or 1.2 mg, added to basal insulin, and for IDegLira (all compared  with lixisenatide 20 μg added to basal insulin) were below the threshold considered  low by Swedish authorities.

With the recent  development of new hyperkalaemia treatments, new information on safe and effective  management of hyperkalaemia has emerged. OBJECTIVES: This systematic literature  review (SLR) aimed to identify all relevant comparative and non-comparative clinical  data on management of hyperkalaemia in adults. Our secondary aim was to assess the  feasibility of quantitatively comparing randomised controlled trial (RCT) data on  the novel treatment sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS) and established  pharmacological treatments for the non-emergency management of hyperkalaemia, such  as the cation-exchangers sodium/calcium polystyrene sulphonate (SPS/CPS). METHODS:  MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched on 3(rd) April 2017, with  additional hand-searches of key congresses and previous SLRs. Articles were screened  by two independent reviewers. Eligible records reported interventional or  observational studies of pharmacological or non-pharmacological management of  hyperkalaemia in adults. RESULTS: Database searches identified 2,073 unique records.  Two hundred and one publications were included, reporting 30 RCTs, 29 interventional  non-RCTs and 43 observational studies. Interventions investigated in RCTs included  ZS (3), SPS/CPS (3), patiromer (4) and combinations of temporising agents (6 RCTs).  A robust and meaningful indirect treatment comparison between ZS and  long-established cation-binding agents (SPS/CPS) was infeasible because of  heterogeneity between studies (including time points and dosing) and small sample  size in SPS/CPS studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite hyperkalaemia being associated with  several chronic diseases, there is a paucity of high-quality randomised evidence on  long-established treatment options (SPS and CPS) and a limited evidence base for  hyperkalaemia management with these agents.",© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"Palaka, Eirini Leonard, Saoirse Buchanan-Hughes, Amy Bobrowska, Anna Langford, Bryony Grandy, Susan",Palaka E Leonard S Buchanan-Hughes A Bobrowska A Langford B Grandy S,ORCID: 0000-0002-5001-7981,"AstraZeneca Ltd, Cambridge, UK.

We therefore conducted a systematic review of NMAs of  pharmacological treatment for common mental disorders in order to assess the  methodological quality of these NMAs, and to relate study characteristics to the  rankings of efficacy and tolerability. STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: We searched  three databases for NMAs of pharmacological treatment used in major depression,  generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and specific  phobia.Studies were appraised using the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics  and Outcomes Research checklist of good research practices for  indirect-treatment-comparison and network-meta-analysis studies. FINDINGS: Twenty  NMAs were eligible for inclusion. The number of randomised controlled trials per NMA  ranged from 11 to 234, and included between 801 to more than 26 000 participants.  Overall, antidepressants were found to be efficacious and tolerable agents for  several disorders based on rankings (45%) or statistical significance (55%). The  majority of NMAs in this review adhered to guidelines by including a network diagram  (70%), assessing consistency (75%), making use of a random effects model (75%),  providing information on the model used to fit the data (75%) and adjusting for  covariates (75%). CONCLUSIONS: The 20 NMAs of depression and anxiety disorders, PTSD  and/or OCD included in this review demonstrate some methodological strengths in  comparison with the larger body of published NMAs for medical disorders, support  current treatment guidelines and help inform clinical decision-making.",© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the  article) 2018.

The objective of this present  analysis is to determine the relative efficacy and acceptability of agomelatine  (25-50 mg) compared to vortioxetine (10-15-20 mg) in adult patients with major  depressive disorder. We performed an adjusted indirect comparison using placebo as a  common control. The main outcomes were efficacy (response to treatment by  Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale/Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) and  acceptability (withdrawal rate for any reason or due to adverse events). 10  agomelatine and 11 vortioxetine studies were included in the analysis. For efficacy,  no difference was shown between agomelatine and vortioxetine (E[95% CI] = -0.03  [-0.12;0.05]). For acceptability, no significant difference was found between both  antidepressants. These findings substantiate current understanding that most  antidepressants are of similar average efficacy and tolerability.

METHODS: Study groups included patients  randomized to adalimumab or placebo (REVEAL and CHAMPION trials) and those  randomized to etanercept or placebo (M10-114 and M10-315 trials). Week 12 outcomes  were compared between patients receiving adalimumab and those receiving etanercept  after adjusting for cross-trial differences in patient characteristics using  propensity score weighting and after subtracting effects of placebo. Outcomes  included proportion of patients achieving 75% or more, 90% or more, and 100%  reductions from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75, PASI90,  PASI100, respectively), symptom resolution (pruritus = 0; psoriatic pain = 0),  lesion resolution (minimal scores for plaque signs erythema, desquamation, and  induration, and by body regions head, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs), absence  of skin-related quality-of-life impact (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] = 0),  ""complete disease control"" (patient's global assessment [PtGA] = 0), and adverse  events. RESULTS: After adjustment, baseline characteristics were balanced among  study groups (adalimumab = 875 vs. placebo = 427; etanercept = 260 vs. placebo =  130). Compared with etanercept, adalimumab was associated with significantly better  placebo-adjusted outcomes (PASI75: 62.3% vs. 42.6%; PASI90: 35.9% vs. 12.1%;  PASI100: 13.1% vs. 4.9%; pruritus: 24.7% vs. 13.0%; psoriatic pain: 27.4% vs. 8.7%;  DLQI: 27.7% vs. 11.7%; and PtGA: 16.4% vs. 10.6%; all P < 0.05), except for similar  rates of adverse events and head-specific lesion resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Compared  with etanercept, adalimumab treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was  associated with greater PASI reduction, higher rates of resolution of skin signs and  symptoms, and greater improvements in dermatological life quality.",Copyright © 2018 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  (ISPOR).

A systematic review and indirect treatment comparison.,10.2147/JPR.S150600 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Low-dose methoxyflurane and nitrous oxide (N(2)O; 50:50 with oxygen) are  both self-administered, self-titrated, rapid-acting, nonnarcotic, and noninvasive  inhalational agents with similar onset times of pain relief. The aim of this review  was to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these analgesics  in emergency care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search and review  according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses  guidelines were performed using Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Library, several  clinical trial registers, and emergency-medicine conference material. RESULTS:  Although both compounds have been used for many years in emergency care, the search  found only a few controlled studies and no head-to-head trials performed in this  setting. Two double-blind, randomized studies comparing their respective study  medication (low-dose methoxyflurane or N(2)O) to placebo were identified that could  be compared in an indirect approach by using placebo as a bridging comparator. Both  agents provided rapid pain relief to trauma patients, with no significant  differences between them; both treatments were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION:  Both low-dose methoxyflurane and N(2)O are suitable options for the pain treatment  of trauma patients in the emergency setting. Due to the ease of administration and  portability, inhaled low-dose methoxyflurane, however, may not only offer advantages  in emergency situations in remote or difficult-to-reach locations and mass-casualty  situations but also be of significant value in urban and rural environments.",NA,"Porter, Keith M Siddiqui, Mohd Kashif Sharma, Ikksheta Dickerson, Sara Eberhardt, Alice",Porter KM Siddiqui MK Sharma I Dickerson S Eberhardt A,NA,"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.

The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either  the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although  there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow  sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled  trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in  psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains  unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head to head,  which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the  efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents (acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric  acid esters, methotrexate), small molecules (apremilast, tofacitinib, ponesimod),  anti-TNF alpha (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab), anti-IL12/23  (ustekinumab), anti-IL17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab), anti-IL23  (guselkumab, tildrakizumab), and other biologics (alefacept, itolizumab) for  patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and to provide a ranking of these  treatments according to their efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the  following databases to December 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, the  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and  LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports. We checked the  reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant  RCTs. We searched the trial results databases of a number of pharmaceutical  companies and handsearched the conference proceedings of a number of dermatology  meetings. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic and  biological treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate to severe  plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed  with moderate to severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to  placebo or another active agent. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three groups of two  review authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of  bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network  meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to  their effectiveness (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score  (PASI) 90) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse effects). We assessed  the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes,  according to GRADE; we evaluated evidence as either very low, low, moderate, or  high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. MAIN RESULTS: We  included 109 studies in our review (39,882 randomised participants, 68% men, all  recruited from a hospital). The overall average age was 44 years; the overall mean  PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo  controlled (67%), 23% were head-to-head studies, and 10% were multi-armed studies  with both an active comparator and placebo. We have assessed all treatments listed  in the objectives (19 in total). In all, 86 trials were multicentric trials (two to  231 centres). All of the trials included in this review were limited to the  induction phase (assessment at less than 24 weeks after randomisation); in fact, all  trials included in the network meta-analysis were measured between 12 and 16 weeks  after randomisation. We assessed the majority of studies (48/109) as being at high  risk of bias; 38 were assessed as at an unclear risk, and 23, low risk.Network  meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (conventional  systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more  effective than placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90.In terms of reaching PASI 90,  the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were  significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic  agents. Small molecules were associated with a higher chance of reaching PASI 90  compared to conventional systemic agents.At drug level, in terms of reaching PASI  90, all of the anti-IL17 agents and guselkumab (an anti-IL23 drug) were  significantly more effective than the anti-TNF alpha agents infliximab, adalimumab,  and etanercept, but not certolizumab. Ustekinumab was superior to etanercept. No  clear difference was shown between infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept. Only one  trial assessed the efficacy of infliximab in this network; thus, these results have  to be interpreted with caution. Tofacitinib was significantly superior to  methotrexate, and no clear difference was shown between any of the other small  molecules versus conventional treatments.Network meta-analysis also showed that  ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab  outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90: the  most effective drug was ixekizumab (risk ratio (RR) 32.45, 95% confidence interval  (CI) 23.61 to 44.60; Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) = 94.3;  high-certainty evidence), followed by secukinumab (RR 26.55, 95% CI 20.32 to 34.69;  SUCRA = 86.5; high-certainty evidence), brodalumab (RR 25.45, 95% CI 18.74 to 34.57;  SUCRA = 84.3; moderate-certainty evidence), guselkumab (RR 21.03, 95% CI 14.56 to  30.38; SUCRA = 77; moderate-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 24.58, 95% CI 3.46  to 174.73; SUCRA = 75.7; moderate-certainty evidence), and ustekinumab (RR 19.91,  95% CI 15.11 to 26.23; SUCRA = 72.6; high-certainty evidence).We found no  significant difference between all of the interventions and the placebo regarding  the risk of serious adverse effects (SAEs): the relative ranking strongly suggested  that methotrexate was associated with the best safety profile regarding all of the  SAEs (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99; SUCRA = 90.7; moderate-certainty evidence),  followed by ciclosporin (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.10; SUCRA = 78.2; very  low-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.36; SUCRA = 70.9;  moderate-certainty evidence), infliximab (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.00; SUCRA =  64.4; very low-certainty evidence), alefacept (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.55; SUCRA =  62.6; low-certainty evidence), and fumaric acid esters (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.30 to  1.99; SUCRA = 57.7; very low-certainty evidence). Major adverse cardiac events,  serious infections, or malignancies were reported in both the placebo and  intervention groups. Nevertheless, the SAEs analyses were based on a very low number  of events with low to very low certainty for just over half of the treatment  estimates in total, moderate for the others. Thus, the results have to be considered  with caution.Considering both efficacy (PASI 90 outcome) and acceptability (SAEs  outcome), highly effective treatments also had more SAEs compared to the other  treatments, and ustekinumab, infliximab, and certolizumab appeared to have the  better trade-off between efficacy and acceptability.Regarding the other efficacy  outcomes, PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1, the results were very  similar to the results for PASI 90.Information on quality of life was often poorly  reported and was absent for a third of the interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our  review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics ixekizumab, secukinumab,  brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab are the best choices for  achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate to severe psoriasis on the basis of  moderate- to high-certainty evidence. At class level, the biologic treatments  anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more  effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents, too. This  NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured between 12 to  16 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficiently relevant for a chronic  disease. Moreover, low numbers of studies were found for some of the interventions,  and the young age (mean age of 44 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20  at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice.Another  major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly reported  safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk  profile of treatments. Indeed, we found no significant difference in the assessed  interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs. Methotrexate appeared to have the best  safety profile, but as the evidence was of very low to moderate quality, we cannot  be sure of the ranking. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of  the treatments included in this review, it will be necessary to evaluate  non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies  as well.In terms of future research, randomised trials comparing directly active  agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is  established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between conventional systemic  and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23,  anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials  should also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve  patients, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.).  Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and  researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the  interventions and the comparative safety of different agents.",NA,"Sbidian, Emilie Chaimani, Anna Garcia-Doval, Ignacio Do, Giao Hua, Camille Mazaud, Canelle Droitcourt, Catherine Hughes, Carolyn Ingram, John R Naldi, Luigi Chosidow, Olivier Le Cleach, Laurence",Sbidian E Chaimani A Garcia-Doval I Do G Hua C Mazaud C Droitcourt C Hughes C Ingram JR Naldi L Chosidow O Le Cleach L,NA,"Department of Dermatology, Hôpital Henri Mondor, 51 Avenue du Maréchal de Lattre de  Tassigny, Créteil, France, 94000.",eng,NA,"Journal Article Meta-Analysis Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Systematic Review",20171222,NA,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,IM,NA,NA,2017/12/23 06:00,2018/01/24 06:00,2017/12/23 06:00,2017/12/23 06:00 [pubmed] 2018/01/24 06:00 [medline] 2017/12/23 06:00 [entrez],CD011535 [pii] 10.1002/14651858.CD011535.pub2 [doi],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017 Dec 22;12(12):CD011535. doi:  10.1002/14651858.CD011535.pub2.,12,12,CD011535,NA,PMC6486272,"Emilie Sbidian: grant support came from the French Society of Dermatology and the  French Ministry of Health, France, the Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique  (DGOS no.14‐0322).

Analysis of  treatment effect from two separate trials had the potential to more accurately  estimate the magnitude of OS benefit due to absence of confounding due to treatment  switching from the control arm to the osimertinib arm of the ongoing randomized  control trial, AURA3. METHODS: Two non-randomized individual datasets were compared:  pooled patients from the AURA extension and AURA2 trials (osimertinib 80 mg,  n = 405, with a confirmed T790M mutation using tissue samples), and patients from  the control arm of the IMPRESS study (platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, n = 61,  with a confirmed T790M mutation using plasma circulating tumour DNA [ctDNA]). A  propensity score-based approach was used to account for differences in baseline  demographics and disease characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline  differences between the two groups, osimertinib demonstrated a statistically  significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus platinum-based  doublet chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.278, 95% confidence interval [CI]  0.188-0.409, p < 0.0001; median PFS 10.9 vs. 5.3 months). Improvements were also  observed for objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) (ORR: 64.3  vs. 33.3%; odds ratio [OR] = 5.31, 95% CI 2.47-11.40, p < 0.001; DCR: 92.1 vs.  75.0%; OR = 4.72, 95% CI 1.92-11.58, p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained for  patients who received osimertinib as second-line treatment only. A statistically  significant improvement in OS was observed for the osimertinib group (HR = 0.412,  95% CI 0.273-0.622, p < 0.0001). Median OS for osimertinib was not reached.  CONCLUSIONS: In this indirect comparison, osimertinib showed a statistically  significant improvement in efficacy outcomes versus platinum-based doublet  chemotherapy in patients with EGFRm T790M NSCLC who had progressed after EGFR-TKI  therapy.",NA,"Mann, Helen Andersohn, Frank Bodnar, Carolyn Mitsudomi, Tetsuya Mok, Tony S K Yang, James Chih-Hsin Hoyle, Christopher",Mann H Andersohn F Bodnar C Mitsudomi T Mok TSK Yang JC Hoyle C,ORCID: 0000-0001-9426-2332,"AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK. helen.mann@astrazeneca.com.

To provide a comprehensive indirect  treatment comparison of efficacy and safety of novel drugs, a network meta-analysis  (NMA) of phase III randomized controlled trials was performed. METHODS: After  pertinent literature search up to November 1, 2016, 6 studies were eligible for the  analysis including 4,812 individual patients with advanced HCC: 2,454 received  sorafenib, 577 received brivanib, 530 received sunitinib, 514 received linifanib,  358 received sorafenib + erlotinib and 379 received placebo. Frequentist NMA was  used to compare treatments within a single analytical framework. RESULTS: NMA showed  that sorafenib alone, regardless of combination with erlotinib, and linifanib  provide a significant survival advantage over placebo (p < 0.05) but without any  significant difference between each other. Conversely, all regimens significantly  ameliorate progression-free survival versus placebo (p < 0.05). The rank order of  efficacy was: sorafenib ± erlotinib, linifanib, brivanib, sunitinib, and placebo.  Sorafenib ± erlotinib was the regimen with the fewest number of adverse events that  required discontinuation of treatment, whereas linifanib and brivanib resulted in  the most adverse events. The risk-benefit summary identified one cluster of  therapies with a similar balance between efficacy and safety which included  sorafenib alone or in combination with erlotinib, having, at the same time, the  highest efficacy and safety. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib remains the best systemic  treatment for advanced HCC; linifanib also resulted in survival advantages over  placebo but with a lower safety profile.",NA,"Cucchetti, Alessandro Piscaglia, Fabio Pinna, Antonio Daniele Djulbegovic, Benjamin Mazzotti, Federico Bolondi, Luigi",Cucchetti A Piscaglia F Pinna AD Djulbegovic B Mazzotti F Bolondi L,NA,"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences - DIMEC, Alma Mater Studiorum -  University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.

Tofacitinib, an oral small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, is  potentially a new treatment option. AIM: To comparatively assess efficacy and harm  of tofacitinib and biologics (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and vedolizumab) in  adult patients not previously exposed to TNF antagonists. METHODS: We performed a  comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, clinical trial registries,  regulatory authorities' websites and major conference proceedings, through August  2017, to identify randomised, placebo-controlled or head-to-head trials assessing  tofacitinib or biologics as induction and/or maintenance therapy in  moderate-to-severe UC. Two reviewers independently extracted study data and  outcomes, and investigated each trial's risk-of-bias. We used conventional  meta-analysis to synthesise direct evidence, and network meta-analysis for adjusted  indirect treatment comparisons. RESULTS: Fifteen randomised, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trials (n = 3130) contributed data for induction: All treatments  are superior to placebo. Indirect treatment comparisons showed that infliximab is  better than adalimumab (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.36-2.98) and golimumab (1.67, 1.08-2.59)  in clinical response, better than adalimumab (2.10, 1.21-3.64) in clinical  remission, and better than adalimumab (1.87, 1.26-2.79) and golimumab (1.75,  1.13-2.73) in mucosal healing. No indirect comparisons between tofacitinib and  biologics reached statistical significance. Nine studies (n = 1776) contributed  maintenance data showing that all treatments have higher clinical efficacy than  placebo. Safety analyses indicated no increased rates of adverse events for the  treatments under evaluation (except for infliximab), while vedolizumab may have an  advantage regarding the occurrence of serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS:  Tofacitinib and biologics are efficacious and safe for UC. Further high-quality  research is warranted to establish the best therapeutic option.",© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"Bonovas, S Lytras, T Nikolopoulos, G Peyrin-Biroulet, L Danese, S",Bonovas S Lytras T Nikolopoulos G Peyrin-Biroulet L Danese S,ORCID: 0000-0001-6102-6579 ORCID: 0000-0003-2536-6618 ORCID: 0000-0001-7341-1351,"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.

We conducted a meta-analysis to indirectly compare overall efficacy and tolerability  between third-generation AEDs in uncontrolled focal epilepsy. METHODS: We performed  an online database search using Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Online Library, and  Clinicaltrial.gov for all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that  investigated the therapeutic effects over a range of AED doses versus placebo. We  then compared clinical efficacy and tolerability between these newer AEDs using  Indirect Treatment Comparison software. RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs with a total of 7245  patients were included in our study. There were no significant differences in the  risk difference of 50% responder rates and seizure free rates between third  generation AEDs, regardless of dose. The risk of treatment emergent adverse events  was significantly higher with ESL and PER treatment compared to BRV at all doses  combined. Withdrawal rates due to adverse events were also significantly higher in  patients treated with the highest doses of LAC and PER versus BRV, while treatment  with ESL or LAC was related to higher withdrawal rates versus BRV when all doses  were combined. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggested there were no significant  differences in efficacy between third generation AEDs in uncontrolled focal  epilepsy. BRV may have the best tolerability profile. The other AEDs were associated  with a higher risk for intolerable adverse, especially when taken at a high doses.  The results from these indirect comparisons warrant further examination and  verification through future well-designed trials.",Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A matching adjusted  indirect comparison (MAIC) was used to compare absolute treatment effects of  daratumumab versus pomalidomide + low-dose dexamethasone (LoDex; 40 mg) on overall  survival (OS), while adjusting for differences between the trial populations.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAIC method reduces the risk of bias associated with  naïve indirect comparisons. Data from 148 patients receiving daratumumab (16 mg/kg),  pooled from the GEN501 and SIRIUS studies, were compared separately with data from  patients receiving pomalidomide + LoDex in the MM-003 and STRATUS studies. RESULTS:  The MAIC-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for OS of daratumumab versus  pomalidomide + LoDex was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.83; p = .0041)  for MM-003 and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.37-0.69; p < .0001) for STRATUS. The treatment  benefit was even more pronounced when the daratumumab population was restricted to  pomalidomide-naïve patients (MM-003: HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.66; p = .0017;  STRATUS: HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.79; p = .0082). An additional analysis indicated a  consistent trend of the OS benefit across subgroups based on M-protein level  reduction (≥50%, ≥25%, and <25%). CONCLUSION: The MAIC results suggest that  daratumumab improves OS compared with pomalidomide + LoDex in patients with heavily  pretreated multiple myeloma. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This matching adjusted  indirect comparison of clinical trial data from four studies analyzes the survival  outcomes of patients with heavily pretreated, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma  who received either daratumumab monotherapy or pomalidomide plus low-dose  dexamethasone. Using this method, daratumumab conferred a significant overall  survival benefit compared with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone.

The aim of this Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) is to assess the relative  efficacies of available open combinations (delivered via separate inhalers) and  fixed-dose combinations (FDCs, delivered via a single inhaler). METHODS: We  conducted a systematic literature review with the aim of identifying randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) of ≥8-week duration in adults aged ≥40 years with COPD that  compared LAMA + LABA combinations with each other, with tiotropium (TIO), or with  placebo. Data on changes from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s  (FEV(1)) and on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, the  Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score, and rescue medication use at 12 and  24 weeks were extracted from these RCTs and analyzed using a NMA in a Bayesian  framework. RESULTS: Data from 44 RCTs were included in the NMA. All FDCs showed  improvements relative to placebo in terms of trough FEV(1), SGRQ total score, and  TDI focal score above clinically relevant thresholds, with the exception of  TIO/olodaterol and aclidinium/formoterol, both of which failed to show clinically  relevant improvements in SGRQ score at 24 weeks. All FDCs demonstrated reduced  rescue medication use versus placebo. Open combinations demonstrated improved  efficacy in all outcomes versus placebo, but these improvements did not consistently  exceed clinically relevant thresholds for SGRQ and TDI scores. All once-daily FDCs  showed improved efficacy versus TIO, but improvements were less consistently  observed versus TIO with open dual combinations and combinations containing  formoterol or salmeterol administered twice daily. Relative probabilities of  improvement between FDCs highlighted potential between-class differences for trough  FEV(1) but suggested little potential for differences in patient-reported outcomes.  CONCLUSION: LAMA + LABA combinations generally showed improved outcomes versus  placebo and TIO. FDCs appeared to perform better than open dual combinations. A  potential effectiveness gradient was observed between FDCs for objectively assessed  functional outcomes, although further prospective trials are required to confirm  these findings.

The  Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group at the University of Liverpool was  commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents a  summary of the company's evidence, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance  (TA440), issued on 26 April 2017. Clinical evidence for liposomal  irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus 5-FU/LV was derived from 236 patients with metastatic  pancreatic cancer in the multinational, open-label, randomised controlled NAPOLI-1  trial. Results from analyses of progression-free survival and overall survival  showed statistically significant improvements for patients treated with liposomal  irinotecan + 5-FU/LV compared with those treated with 5-FU/LV. However, 5-FU/LV  alone is rarely used in National Health Service clinical practice for patients with  metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with gemcitabine. The company, ERG  and Appraisal Committee (AC) all agreed that oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV is the most  commonly used treatment. Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV was compared with 5-FU/LV in two  trials identified by the company. However, the company and the ERG both considered  attempts to compare the efficacy of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV with  oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV to be methodologically flawed; not only was there  heterogeneity between trials and their populations but also the proportional hazards  assumption required to conduct a robust indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was  violated. Nonetheless, data derived from an ITC were used to inform the company's  economic model. Using the discounted patient access scheme price for liposomal  irinotecan + 5-FU/LV, the company reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio  (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of £54,412 for the comparison  with oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV. The ERG considered that the company's base-case  cost-effectiveness results for the comparison of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV  versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV were underestimates and should be interpreted with  extreme caution. Following implementation of a number of model amendments, the ERG's  modified exploratory ICER for the comparison of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV  versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV was £106,898 per QALY gained. The AC accepted the  majority of the ERG's amendments to the model, and also highlighted that the total  QALYs for oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV were lower than for 5-FU/LV in the company's model,  which the AC considered to be clinically implausible. The AC therefore considered  results from exploratory analyses, undertaken by the ERG, which included altering  the QALY difference between liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV  by ± 10%. These analyses resulted in ICERs for the comparison of liposomal  irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV of between £201,019 per QALY  gained to liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV being dominated by oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV.  Therefore, despite uncertainty around the clinical-effectiveness evidence and  cost-effectiveness results, the AC was confident that the ICER was in excess of  £50,000 per QALY gained. The final guidance issued by NICE is that liposomal  irinotecan + 5-FU/LV is not recommended within its marketing authorisation for  treating metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in adults whose disease has  progressed after gemcitabine-based therapy.",NA,"Fleeman, Nigel Abdulla, Ahmed Bagust, Adrian Beale, Sophie Richardson, Marty Stainthorpe, Angela Boland, Angela Kotas, Eleanor McEntee, Joanne Palmer, Daniel",Fleeman N Abdulla A Bagust A Beale S Richardson M Stainthorpe A Boland A Kotas E McEntee J Palmer D,NA,"Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69  3GB, UK. nigel.fleeman@liverpool.ac.uk.

METHODS: Using longitudinal chart data from the  Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies (RMG) of the Czech Myeloma Group, patient-level  data from the RMG was pooled with pivotal daratumumab monotherapy studies (GEN501  and SIRIUS; 16 mg/kg). RESULTS: From the RMG database, we identified 972 treatment  lines in 463 patients previously treated with both a proteasome inhibitor and an  immunomodulatory drug. Treatment initiation dates for RMG patients were between  March 2006 and March 2015. The most frequently used treatment regimens were  lenalidomide-based regimens (33.4%), chemotherapy (18.1%), bortezomib-based regimens  (13.6%), thalidomide-based regimens (8.0%), and bortezomib plus thalidomide (5.3%).  Few patients were treated with carfilzomib-based regimens (2.5%) and  pomalidomide-based regimens (2.4%). Median observed PFS for daratumumab and the RMG  cohort was 4.0 and 5.8 months (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% confidence  interval [CI], 0.94-1.39), respectively, and unadjusted median OS was 20.1 and 11.9  months (unadjusted HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48-0.78), respectively. Statistical  adjustments for differences in baseline characteristics were made using  patient-level data. The adjusted HRs (95% CI) for PFS and OS for daratumumab versus  the RMG cohort were 0.79 (0.56-1.12; p = .192) and 0.33 (0.21-0.52; p < .001),  respectively.

OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy and  quality of life using matching-adjusted indirect comparisons for treatment with  ixekizumab vs. secukinumab. METHODS: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  improvement of at least 75%, 90% and 100% and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  0/1 response rates for approved dosages of ixekizumab (160 mg at Week 0, then 80 mg  every two weeks for the first 12 weeks) and secukinumab (300 mg at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3  and 4, then 300 mg every 4 weeks) treatment were compared using data from active  (etanercept and ustekinumab) and placebo-controlled studies. Comparisons were made  using the Bucher (BU) method and two modified versions of the Signorovitch (SG)  method (SG total and SG separate). Subsequently, results based on active treatment  common comparators were combined using generic inverse-variance meta-analysis.  RESULTS: In the meta-analysis of studies with active comparators, PASI 90 response  rates were 12·7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5·5-19·8, P = 0·0005], 10·0% (95% CI  2·1-18·0, P = 0·01) and 11·2% (95% CI 3·2-19·1, P = 0·006) higher and PASI 100  response rates were 11·7% (95% CI 5·9-17·5, P < 0·001), 12·7% (95% CI 6·0-19·4,  P < 0·001) and 13·1% (95% CI 6·3-19·9, P < 0·001) higher for ixekizumab compared  with secukinumab using BU, SG total and SG separate methods. PASI 75 results were  comparable when SG methods were used and favoured ixekizumab when the BU method was  used. Week 12 DLQI 0/1 response rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS:  Ixekizumab had higher PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses at week 12 compared with  secukinumab using adjusted indirect comparisons.",© 2017 The Authors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from phase 3 trials providing evidence for  estimating the relative efficacy and safety of IDegLira vs iGlarLixi in patients  uncontrolled on basal insulin-only regimens were used in this analysis. Outcomes of  interest were changes in HbA(1c), body weight and insulin dose, and rate ratio of  hypoglycemia. The indirect comparison of the reported trial findings followed the  principles of Bucher et al. RESULTS: IDegLira was estimated to provide a 0.44 [95%  CI = 0.17-0.71] %-point reduction in HbA(1c) compared with iGlarLixi. Body weight  was reduced by 1.42 [95% CI = 0.35-2.50] kg with IDegLira compared with iGlarLixi.  Insulin dose was comparable between the two interventions. The rate of severe or  blood glucose-confirmed (self-measured plasma glucose [SMPG] ≤ 3.1 mmol/L)  hypoglycemia with IDegLira was approximately half that of iGlarLixi (rate  ratio = 0.51 [95% CI = 0.29-0.90]). However, using the American Diabetes Association  definition of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (SMPG ≤3.9 mmol/L) the rate was  comparable between the two treatments (rate ratio = 1.07 [95% CI = 0.90-1.28]).  LIMITATIONS: The assumptions made in the indirect comparison and differences between  the included trials in baseline HbA(1c) levels, previous use of sulfonylureas,  definitions of hypoglycemia, presence or absence of run-in period, the different  duration of the trials, and the cross-over design of one of the trials. CONCLUSIONS:  The results of this indirect treatment comparison demonstrate that, among patients  with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, treatment with IDegLira results in a  greater reduction of HbA(1c) and a greater reduction in body weight compared with  iGlarLixi at similar insulin doses.",NA,"Evans, Marc Billings, Liana K Håkan-Bloch, Jonas Slothuus, Ulla Abrahamsen, Trine J Andersen, Andreas Jansen, Jeroen P",Evans M Billings LK Håkan-Bloch J Slothuus U Abrahamsen TJ Andersen A Jansen JP,NA,"a University Hospital Llandough , Cardiff , UK. b NorthShore University HealthSystem , Evanston , IL , USA. c University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine , Chicago , IL , USA. d Novo Nordisk A/S , Søborg , Copenhagen , Denmark. d Novo Nordisk A/S , Søborg , Copenhagen , Denmark. d Novo Nordisk A/S , Søborg , Copenhagen , Denmark. d Novo Nordisk A/S , Søborg , Copenhagen , Denmark. e Precision Health Economics , Oakland , CA , USA.",eng,NA,"Clinical Trial, Phase III Journal Article",20171203,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,IM,NOTNLM,GLP-1 basal insulin glycemic control network meta-analysis insulin analogs liraglutide,2017/11/23 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,2017/11/23 06:00,2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed] 2018/09/18 06:00 [medline] 2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/13696998.2017.1409228 [doi],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2018 Apr;21(4):340-347. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2017.1409228.

The need for frequent injections with existing rFVIII  products may, however, result in poor adherence to prophylaxis, leading to increased  bleeding and long-term joint damage. Recombinant FVIIIFc (rFVIIIFc) is an extended  half-life fusion protein which can offer prolonged protection and reduced dosing  frequency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of  prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc in severe hemophilia A from the perspective of the Swedish  health system. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate lifetime costs and  benefits of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc vs rFVIII products. Clinical outcomes were  represented by annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and quality of life via disutility  applied to bleeding events and injection frequency. Costs included the cost of FVIII  for routine prophylaxis and bleed resolution. The pooled comparator was costed by  weighting the cost of individual products by their market share. RESULTS: In the  base case, rFVIIIFc was dominant vs the pooled comparator. Savings of SEK 9.0  million per patient resulted from lower factor consumption for prophylaxis and bleed  resolution. Fewer bleeds and reduced injection frequency yielded an estimated 0.59  quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were sensitive to drug dosage and  robust to variation in other parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis  suggested a greater than 85% probability of rFVIIIFc being cost-effective at a  willingness-to-pay threshold of 500,000 SEK/QALY. LIMITATIONS: Due to unavailibilty  of patient-level data, treatment benefit was based on a non-adjusted indirect  comparison. Dosing and treatment outcomes were assumed to persist over the model  duration in the absence of long-term outcome data. CONCLUSION: The results suggest  that rFVIIIFc may be a cost-effective option for hemophilia A prophylaxis,  generating greater quality of life and reduced costs for the Swedish payer compared  to more frequently administered rFVIII alternatives.",NA,"Henry, Nathaniel Jovanović, Jelena Schlueter, Max Kritikou, Persefoni Wilson, Koo Myrén, Karl-Johan",Henry N Jovanović J Schlueter M Kritikou P Wilson K Myrén KJ,NA,"a IQVIA , London , UK. a IQVIA , London , UK. a IQVIA , London , UK. b Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB , Stockholm , Sweden. b Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB , Stockholm , Sweden. b Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB , Stockholm , Sweden.",eng,NA,"Clinical Trial, Phase III Journal Article Multicenter Study Randomized Controlled Trial",20171204,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,IM,NOTNLM,Cost-effectiveness analysis annualized bleeding rate cost-utility extended half-life factor VIII hemophilia A prophylaxis,2017/11/16 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,2017/11/16 06:00,2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed] 2018/09/18 06:00 [medline] 2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/13696998.2017.1405816 [doi],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2018 Apr;21(4):318-325. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2017.1405816.

A recent Cochrane systematic review demonstrated that  intramuscular interferon beta 1a (IFN-β-1a-IM) was inferior to the other beta  interferons (IFN-βs) for multiple sclerosis (MS). As a result, CONITEC commissioned  an analysis to review possible disinvestment within SUS. The objective of this paper  is to describe the disinvestment process for IFN-β-1a-IM in Brazil. The first  assessment comprised a literature review and mixed treatment comparison  meta-analysis. The outcome of interest was the proportion of relapse-free patients  in 2 years. This analysis confirmed the inferiority of IFN-β-1a-IM. Following this,  CONITEC recommended disinvestment, with the decision sent for public consultation.  More than 3000 contributions were made on CONITEC's webpage, most of them against  the preliminary decision. As a result, CONITEC commissioned a study to assess the  effectiveness of IFN-β-1a-IM among Brazilian patients in routine clinical care. The  second assessment involved an 11-year follow-up of a non-concurrent cohort of 12,154  MS patients developed by deterministic-probabilistic linkage of SUS administrative  databases. The real-world assessment further demonstrated that IFN-β-1a-IM users had  a statistically higher risk of treatment failure, defined as treatment switching or  relapse treatment or death, with the assessment showing that IFN-β-1a-IM was  inferior to the other IFN-βs and to glatiramer acetate in both direct and indirect  analysis. In the drug ranking with 40,000 simulations, IFN-β-1a-IM was the worst  option, with a success rate of only 152/40,000. Following this, CONITEC decided to  exclude the intramuscular presentation of IFN-β from the current MS treatment  guidelines, giving patients who are currently on this treatment the option of  continuing until treatment failure.

Chemical characterization of the IvEO showed anethole (89.12%) as major  compound followed by estragole (4.859%). The IvEO showed broad fungitoxic spectrum  against common food borne moulds. It's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and  minimum aflatoxin B(1) inhibitory concentration (MAIC) against aflatoxigenic strain  Aspergillus flavus LHP-PV-1 were 0.7, and 0.5 μL/mL respectively. Morphological  observations of treatment sets by SEM and TEM along with decrease in ergosterol  content and enhanced leakage of Ca(2+), K(+) and Mg(2+) ions denoted fungal cell  membrane as site of action. The IvEO showed promising free radical scavenging  activity and favourable safety profile with high LD(50) value on mice. The IvEO also  exhibited considerable protection of Pistacia vera from fungal contamination and  complete protection from aflatoxin B(1) contamination in storage containers.  Nanoencapsulated IvEO in gel form and lyophilized form exhibited enhanced efficacy  as fungal inhibitor and aflatoxin suppressor. The chemically characterised IvEO may  be recommended as plant based preservative having favourable safety and its  nanocapsules may be of industrial significance as shelf life enhancer of food items.

Alternatively, network  meta-analysis (NMA) is one method of analyzing multiple indirect treatment  comparisons. However, NMA does not account for mixed end points or temporality.  Previously, we described a prototype information theoretical approach for the  construction of ranked chemotherapy treatment regimen networks. Here, we propose  modifications to overcome an apparent straw man effect, where the most studied  regimens were the most negatively valued. METHODS: RCTs from two scenarios-upfront  treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and relapsed/refractory multiple  myeloma-were assembled into ranked networks using an automated algorithm based on  effect sizes, statistical significance, surrogacy of end points, and time since RCT  publication. Vertex and edge color, transparency, and size were used to visually  analyze the network. This analysis led to the additional incorporation of value  propagation. RESULTS: A total of 18 regimens with 42 connections (chronic  myelogenous leukemia) and 28 regimens with 25 connections (relapsed/refractory  multiple myeloma) were analyzed. An initial negative correlation between vertex  value and size was ameliorated after value propagation, although not eliminated.  Updated rankings were in close agreement with published guidelines and NMAs.  CONCLUSION: Straw man effects can distort the comparative efficacy of newer regimens  at the expense of older regimens, which are often cheaper or less toxic. Using an  automated method, we ameliorated this effect and produced rankings consistent with  common practice and published guidelines in two distinct cancer settings. These  findings are likely to be generalizable and suggest a new means of ranking efficacy  in cancer trials.",NA,"Warner, Jeremy L Yang, Peter C Alterovitz, Gil",Warner JL Yang PC Alterovitz G,NA,"Jeremy L.

Kleijnen Systematic  Reviews Ltd (KSR) and Erasmus University Rotterdam were commissioned as the Evidence  Review Group (ERG) for this submission. The ERG reviewed the evidence submitted by  the manufacturer, validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model, and  conducted exploratory analyses in order to assess the robustness and validity of the  presented clinical and cost-effectiveness results. This paper describes the company  submission, the ERG assessment, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The company  conducted a systematic review to identify studies comparing POM with comparators  outlined in the NICE scope: panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone (PANO +  BOR + DEX), bendamustine with thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD) and conventional  chemotherapy (CC). The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from  MM-003, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing POM + LoDEX with high-dose  dexamethasone (HiDEX; used as a proxy for CC). Additional data from other studies  were also used as nonrandomized observational data sources for the indirect  treatment comparison of POM + LoDEX with BTD and PANO + BOR + DEX. Covariate or  treatment switching adjustment methods were used for each comparison. The model  developed in Microsoft(®) Excel 2010 using a semi-Markov partitioned survival  structure, submitted in the original submission to NICE for TA338, was adapted for  the present assessment of the cost effectiveness of POM + LoDEX. Updated evidence  from the clinical-effectiveness part was used for the survival modelling of  progression-free survival and overall survival. For POM + LoDEX, the patient access  scheme (PAS) discount was applied to the POM price. Three separate comparisons were  conducted for each comparator, each comparison using a different dataset and  adjustment methods. The ERG identified and corrected some errors, and the corrected  incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for POM + LoDEX versus each comparator  were presented: approximately £45,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained  versus BTD, savings of approximately £143,000 per QALY lost versus PANO + BOR + DEX,  and approximately £49,000 per QALY gained versus CC. The ERG also conducted full  incremental analyses, which revealed that CC, POM + LoDEX and PANO + BOR + DEX were  on the cost-effectiveness frontier. The committee's decision on the technology under  analysis deemed that POM + LoDEX should be recommended as an option for treating  multiple myeloma in adults at third or subsequent relapse of treatments including  both LEN and BOR, contingent on the company providing POM with the discount agreed  in the PAS.",NA,"Büyükkaramikli, Nasuh C de Groot, Saskia Fayter, Debra Wolff, Robert Armstrong, Nigel Stirk, Lisa Worthy, Gill Albuquerque de Almeida, Fernando Kleijnen, Jos Al, Maiwenn J",Büyükkaramikli NC de Groot S Fayter D Wolff R Armstrong N Stirk L Worthy G Albuquerque de Almeida F Kleijnen J Al MJ,ORCID: 0000-0002-2021-9574,"Institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA), Institute of Health Policy and  Management (iBMG), Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  buyukkaramikli@imta.eur.nl.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have  been evaluated relative to enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis though head-to-head  comparisons of these agents are lacking. Therefore, we conducted a mixed treatment  comparisons meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of established  treatments and DOACs for VTE prophylaxis in medically-ill patients. A comprehensive  literature search was conducted to identify randomized trials evaluating UFH, LMWHs  or DOACS for the prevention of VTE in medically ill patients. Articles were  retrieved and cross-referenced for additional trials, evaluated and entered into  ADDIS (version 1.16.6) to generate direct and indirect treatment comparisons for  VTE, DVT, PE, death from any cause, and bleeding. Ten articles were included and  eight anticoagulants were evaluated in a treatment network representing data on  28,382 patients. We found each treatment had similar efficacy in preventing VTE,  DVT, PE, death from any cause and each had similar risk of minor and major bleeding.  Overall, placebo was associated with more VTE and DVT events compared to LMWHs and  DOACs. We found that UFH, LMWHs and DOACs are comparable in preventing VTE, DVT, PE,  and death from any cause and in association with minor and major bleeding.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and  network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, indirectly evaluating overall  survival (OS) for men treated with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone  with ADT (Abi-ADT) versus docetaxel with ADT (Doce-ADT) in hormone-naïve high-risk  and metastatic PCa. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus,  and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched in August 2017. We pooled results  using the inverse variance technique and random-effects models. The Bucher technique  for indirect treatment comparison was used to compare Abi-ADT with Doce-ADT. A  priori subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS:  Overall, 6067 patients from five trials were included: 1181 (19.5%) patients who  received Doce-ADT, 1557 (25.7%) patients who received Abi-ADT, and 3329 (54.9%)  patients who received ADT-alone. There was a total of 1921 deaths: 391 in the  Doce-ADT group, 353 in the Abi-ADT group, and 1177 in the ADT-only group. The pooled  hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63-0.91,  I(2)=51%, 3 trials, 2951 patients) for Doce-ADT versus ADT-alone and 0.63 (95% CI:  0.55-0.72, I(2)=0%, 2 trials, 3116 patients) for Abi-ADT versus ADT-alone. The  indirect comparison of Abi-ADT to Doce-ADT demonstrated no statistically significant  difference in OS between these approaches (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.67-1.06). Findings  were similar in various a priori subset analyses, including patients with metastatic  disease. Bayesian analyses demonstrated comparable results (HR: 0.83, 95% CI:  0.63-1.16). Despite the lack of statistical significance, Surface Under the  Cumulative Ranking Analysis demonstrated an 89% probability that Abi-ADT was  preferred. CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify a significant difference in OS between  Abi-ADT and Doce-ADT for men with hormone-naïve high-risk or metastatic PCa,  although Bayesian analysis demonstrates a high likelihood that Abi-ADT was  preferred. PATIENT SUMMARY: We synthesized the evidence available from studies  examining the administration of docetaxel or abiraterone in combination with  hormonal therapy for patients with newly diagnosed, advanced prostate cancer. While  these studies did not directly compare these agents, we used methodological  techniques to indirectly compare them and found no significant difference in overall  survival.",Copyright © 2017 European Association of Urology.

The objective of this study was to assess the  cost-effectiveness of POM-d, DARA, and CAR in this patient population from a US  payer's perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to estimate  the cost and health outcomes over a 3-year time horizon in 3 health states:  progression-free, post-progression, and death. The main efficacy data source was a  matching-adjusted indirect comparison using data from the aforementioned studies.  Direct medical costs were considered, including: treatment acquisition and  administration (initial line and subsequent line), pre- and post-medication,  prophylaxis treatment, adverse event management, and health care resource  utilization. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. A scenario analysis that assumed  equal efficacy across all 3 treatments was conducted. Costs, life-years, and  quality-adjusted life-years were estimated and discounted at 3% per annum. FINDINGS:  Over 3 years, the use of POM-d was associated with similar life-years and  quality-adjusted life-years gained compared with DARA and CAR (incremental:  life-years, +0.02 and +0.07, respectively; quality-adjusted life-years, +0.01 and  +0.05), and with a cost less than that of DARA (-$8,919) and similar to that of CAR  (-$195). Sensitivity analyses illustrated that the results were sensitive to  progression-free survival, treatment duration, and drug costs. An equal efficacy  scenario resulted in cost-savings relative to those of both DARA and CAR (-$11,779  and -$12,595). IMPLICATIONS: POM-d may be a cost-effective treatment option relative  to DARA or CAR in heavily pretreated patients with RRMM in the US.",Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: The evidence network for  this report comprised 1 tetrabenazine trial and 1 deutetrabenazine trial, both  against placebo. Risk of bias was moderate in both. Participants in the  tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine trials did not differ significantly on motor  scores or adverse events. Depression and somnolence scales significantly favored  deutetrabenazine. CONCLUSION: There is low-quality evidence that tetrabenazine and  deutetrabenazine do not differ in efficacy or safety.

Late adverse effects include secondary  malignancies which often have a poor prognosis. To synthesise evidence on the risk  of secondary malignancies after current treatment approaches comprising chemotherapy  and/or radiotherapy, we performed a meta-analysis based on individual patient data  (IPD) from patients treated for newly diagnosed HL. OBJECTIVES: We investigated  several questions concerning possible changes in the risk of secondary malignancies  when modifying chemotherapy or radiotherapy (omission of radiotherapy, reduction of  the radiation field, reduction of the radiation dose, use of fewer chemotherapy  cycles, intensification of chemotherapy). We also analysed whether these  modifications affect progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL trials databases  comprehensively in June 2010 for all randomised trials in HL since 1984. Key  international trials registries were also searched. The search was updated in March  2015 without collecting further IPD (one further eligible study found) and again in  July 2017 (no further eligible studies). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised  controlled trials (RCTs) for untreated HL patients which enrolled at least 50  patients per arm, completed recruitment by 2007 and performed a treatment comparison  relevant to our objectives. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study groups submitted  IPD, including age, sex, stage and the outcomes secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN),  OS and PFS as time-to-event data. We meta-analysed these data using Petos method  (SMN) and Cox regression with inverse-variance pooling (OS, PFS) for each of the  five study questions, and performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the  applicability and robustness of the results. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 21 eligible  trials and obtained IPD for 16. For four studies no data were supplied despite  repeated efforts, while one study was only identified in 2015 and IPD were not  sought. For each study question, between three and six trials with between 1101 and  2996 participants in total and median follow-up between 6.7 and 10.8 years were  analysed. All participants were adults and mainly under 60 years. Risk of bias was  assessed as low for the majority of studies and outcomes. Chemotherapy alone versus  same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. Omitting additional radiotherapy probably  reduces secondary malignancy incidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence  interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.82, low quality of evidence), corresponding to an estimated  reduction of eight-year SMN risk from 8% to 4%. This decrease was particularly true  for secondary acute leukemias. However, we had insufficient evidence to determine  whether OS rates differ between patients treated with chemotherapy alone versus  combined-modality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.11, moderate quality of  evidence). There was a slightly higher rate of PFS with combined modality, but our  confidence in the results was limited by high levels of statistical heterogeneity  between studies (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.73, moderate quality of evidence).  Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus  extended-field radiation (early stages) . There is insufficient evidence to  determine whether smaller radiation field reduces SMN risk (Peto OR 0.86, 95% CI  0.64 to 1.16, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.89, 95% C: 0.70 to 1.12, high  quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21, high quality of  evidence). Chemotherapy plus lower-dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus  higher-dose radiation (early stages). There is insufficient evidence to determine  the effect of lower-radiation dose on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50,  low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28, high quality of  evidence) or PFS (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.48, high quality of evidence). Fewer  versus more courses of chemotherapy (each with or without radiotherapy; early  stages). Fewer chemotherapy courses probably has little or no effect on SMN risk  (Peto OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62), OS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to1.34) or PFS (HR  1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.45).Outcomes had a moderate (SMN) or high (OS, PFS) quality  of evidence. Dose-intensified versus ABVD-like chemotherapy (with or without  radiotherapy in each case). In the mainly advanced-stage patients who were treated  with intensified chemotherapy, the rate of secondary malignancies was low. There was  insufficient evidence to determine the effect of chemotherapy intensification (Peto  OR 1.37, CI 0.89 to 2.10, low quality of evidence). The rate of secondary acute  leukemias (and for younger patients, all secondary malignancies) was probably higher  than among those who had treatment with standard-dose ABVD-like protocols. In  contrast, the intensified chemotherapy protocols probably improved PFS (eight-year  PFS 75% versus 69% for ABVD-like treatment, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95, moderate  quality of evidence). Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified  chemotherapy was not conclusive (HR: 0.85, CI 0.70 to 1.04), although escalated-dose  BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival compared to ABVD-like chemotherapy (HR 0.58,  95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, moderate quality of evidence).Generally, we could draw valid  conclusions only in terms of secondary haematological malignancies, which usually  occur less than 10 years after initial treatment, while follow-up within the present  analysis was too short to record all solid tumours. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The risk  of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) is  increased but efficacy is improved among patients treated with intensified  chemotherapy protocols. Treatment decisions must be tailored for individual  patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of  secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define which patients can  safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and  advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of  fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced-dose radiotherapy did not  appear to markedly affect efficacy or secondary malignancy risk. Due to the limited  amount of long-term follow-up in this meta-analysis, further long-term  investigations of late events are needed, particularly with respect to secondary  solid tumours.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A partitioned survival  model with three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, and death)  from a UK payer perspective and over lifetime (15 years) was developed. Direct costs  included disease management, treatment-related (acquisition, administration,  monitoring, adverse events), and T790M testing costs. Efficacy and safety data were  taken from clinical trials AURA extension and AURA2 for osimertinib and IMPRESS for  PDC. An adjusted indirect treatment comparison was applied to reduce the potential  bias in the non-randomized comparison. Parametric functions were utilized to  extrapolate survival beyond the observed period. Health state utility values were  calculated from EQ-5D data collected in the trials and valued using UK tariffs.  Resource use and costs were based on published sources. RESULTS: Osimertinib was  associated with a gain of 1.541 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an  incremental cost of £64,283 vs PDC (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]:  £41,705/QALY gained). Scenario analyses showed that none of the plausible scenarios  produced an ICER above £44,000 per QALY gained, and probabilistic sensitivity  analyses demonstrated a 63.4% probability that osimertinib will be cost-effective at  a willingness-to-pay threshold of £50,000. LIMITATIONS: The analysis is subject to  some level of uncertainty inherent to phase 2 single-arm data and the immaturity of  the currently available survival data for osimertinib. CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib may  be considered a cost-effective treatment option compared with PDC in the second-line  setting in patients with EGFR-T790M mutation-positive NSCLC from a UK payer  perspective.

To assess value for money, their cost effectiveness in patients with  metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel  from the Dutch societal perspective was investigated. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness  analysis was conducted using efficacy, symptomatic skeletal-related event and safety  data obtained from indirect treatment comparisons. Missing skeletal-related event  data for cabazitaxel were conservatively assumed to be identical to radium-223. A  Markov model combined these clinical inputs with Dutch-specific resource use and  costs for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment from a societal  perspective. Total quality-adjusted life-years and costs in 2017 euros were  calculated over a 5-year (lifetime) time horizon. RESULTS: Radium-223 resulted in  €6092 and €4465 lower costs and 0.02 and 0.01 higher quality-adjusted life-years  compared with abiraterone and cabazitaxel, respectively, demonstrating dominance of  radium-223. Sensitivity analyses reveal a 64% (54%) chance of radium-223 being cost  effective compared with abiraterone (cabazitaxel) at the informal €80,000  willingness-to-pay threshold. Compared with enzalutamide, radium-223 resulted in  slightly lower quality-adjusted life-years (-0.06) and €7390 lower costs, revealing  a 61% chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with enzalutamide. The  lower costs of radium-223 compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide are driven by  lower drug costs and prevention of expensive skeletal-related events. Compared with  cabazitaxel, the lower costs of radium-223 are driven by lower costs of the drug,  administration and adverse events. CONCLUSION: Radium-223 may be a less costly  treatment strategy offering similar gains in health benefits compared with  abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide in patients with metastatic  castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the  Dutch societal perspective.",NA,"Peters, Michel L de Meijer, Claudine Wyndaele, Dirk Noordzij, Walter Leliveld-Kors, Annemarie M van den Bosch, Joan van den Berg, Pieter H Baka, Agni Gaultney, Jennifer G",Peters ML de Meijer C Wyndaele D Noordzij W Leliveld-Kors AM van den Bosch J van den Berg PH Baka A Gaultney JG,ORCID: 0000-0002-3322-1075,"Real World Strategy and Analytics, Mapi Group, Houten, The Netherlands.

There is insufficient evidence on the most effective management  of the appendix stump. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative  effectiveness and provide a treatment ranking of different options for securing the  appendix stump. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized  controlled trials comparing ligation methods of the appendix. The primary outcomes  were organ/space infection and superficial operative site infection. We performed a  network meta-analysis and estimated the pairwise relative treatment effects of the  competing interventions using the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. We  obtained a hierarchy of the competing interventions using rankograms and the surface  under the cumulative ranking curve. RESULTS: Forty-three randomized controlled  trials were eligible and provided data for >5,000 patients. Suture ligation seemed  to be the most effective treatment strategy, in terms of both organ/space infection  and superficial operative site infection. Statistical significance was reached for  the comparisons of clip versus endoloop (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval,  0.32-0.96) for organ/space infection; and suture versus clip (odds ratio 0.20, 95%  confidence interval 0.08-0.55) and clip versus endoloop (odds ratio 2.22, 95%  confidence interval 1.56-3.13) for superficial operative site infection. The network  was informed primarily by indirect treatment comparisons. CONCLUSION: The use of  suture ligation of the appendix in laparoscopic appendectomy seems to be superior to  other methods for the composite parameters of organ/space and superficial operative  site infection.",Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To attempt to account for  heterogeneity among trials, propensity-score weighted patient-level data were used  to indirectly compare placebo responses reported in brivaracetam and levetiracetam  trials. METHODS: Patient-level data from randomised, placebo-controlled brivaracetam  (recruited 2007-2014) and levetiracetam (1993-1998) trials were pooled. Consistent  inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied and outcomes were defined consistently.  Potentially confounding baseline characteristics were adjusted for using propensity  score weighting. Weighting success was assessed using placebo response. RESULTS: In  total, 707 and 473 active drug and 399 and 253 placebo patients comprised the  brivaracetam and levetiracetam groups, respectively. Before weighting, several  baseline variables were significantly different between groups; after weighting,  prior vagal nerve stimulation, co-morbid depression and co-morbid anxiety remained  different. Before weighting, median seizure frequency reduction was 21.7 and 3.9% in  the brivaracetam and levetiracetam placebo arms, respectively; after weighting,  median reduction was 15.0 and 6.0%. The comparison of non-randomised groups could be  biased by unobserved confounding factors and region of residence. Lifetime AED  history was unavailable in the brivaracetam trials and excluded from analysis.  CONCLUSIONS: Placebo responses remained different between brivaracetam and  levetiracetam trials after propensity score weighting, indicating the presence of  residual confounding factors associated with placebo response in these trials. It  therefore remains problematic to conduct reliable indirect comparisons of  brivaracetam and levetiracetam given the current evidence base, which may apply to  comparisons between other AED trials.",NA,"Swallow, Elyse Fang, Anna Signorovitch, James Plumb, Jonathan Borghs, Simon",Swallow E Fang A Signorovitch J Plumb J Borghs S,ORCID: 0000-0003-1081-7981,"Analysis Group, Inc., 111 Huntington Ave, Floor 14, Boston, MA, USA.

Our aim was to compare the efficacy and  tolerability of newer AEDs with Levetiracetam (LEV), when used as add-on treatments  for uncontrolled focal epilepsy. METHOD: We conducted an online database search on  PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Online Library and Clinicaltrials.gov for all available  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the therapeutic effects of newer  AEDs or LEV vs placebo. Indirect comparisons for clinical efficacy and tolerability  at different doses between the newer AEDs and LEV were then performed using Indirect  Treatment Comparison (ITC) software. RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs with a total of 8540  patients were included. Compared to LEV, ESL, LAC and BRV did not showed significant  difference in efficacy at all dose level. PER showed lower 50% response rates and  seizure-free rates at the highest effective recommended dosages. Treatment-emergent  adverse events (TEAEs) and withdrawal rates due to adverse events (AEs) of LAC and  PER were higher than LEV at the highest effective recommended dosages, and overall  AE rates from ESL were higher than LEV. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons suggested  that ESL, LAC and BRV were not inferior to LEV in efficacy. ESL, LAC and PER may  have a possible worse tolerability profile compared to LEV at high dose. But BRV may  exhibit a similar tolerability to LEV. Newer AEDs cannot exceed the LEV on efficacy  and tolerability.",Copyright © 2017.

Methods which relax this  assumption are becoming increasingly common for submissions to reimbursement  agencies, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).  These methods use individual patient data from a subset of trials to form  population-adjusted indirect comparisons between treatments, in a specific target  population. Recently proposed population adjustment methods include the  Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) and the Simulated Treatment Comparison  (STC). Despite increasing popularity, MAIC and STC remain largely untested.  Furthermore, there is a lack of clarity about exactly how and when they should be  applied in practice, and even whether the results are relevant to the decision  problem. There is therefore a real and present risk that the assumptions being made  in one submission to a reimbursement agency are fundamentally different to-or even  incompatible with-the assumptions being made in another for the same indication. We  describe the assumptions required for population-adjusted indirect comparisons, and  demonstrate how these may be used to generate comparisons in any given target  population. We distinguish between anchored and unanchored comparisons according to  whether a common comparator arm is used or not. Unanchored comparisons make much  stronger assumptions, which are widely regarded as infeasible. We provide  recommendations on how and when population adjustment methods should be used, and  the supporting analyses that are required to provide statistically valid, clinically  meaningful, transparent and consistent results for the purposes of health technology  appraisal. Simulation studies are needed to examine the properties of population  adjustment methods and their robustness to breakdown of assumptions.",NA,"Phillippo, David M Ades, Anthony E Dias, Sofia Palmer, Stephen Abrams, Keith R Welton, Nicky J",Phillippo DM Ades AE Dias S Palmer S Abrams KR Welton NJ,NA,"School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK (DMP,  AEA, SD, NJW).

In the absence of  head-to-head trials, this study compared the clinical efficacy and cost  effectiveness of adalimumab 40 mg versus secukinumab 150 and 300 mg for the  treatment of active PsA. METHODS: A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was  conducted using individual patient data from the ADEPT trial of adalimumab and  published data from FUTURE I and II. To adjust for the cross-trial differences,  individual patients in ADEPT were re-weighted so that the mean baseline  characteristics (including age, weight, gender, race, baseline methotrexate use,  psoriasis ≥3% body surface area, baseline PASI score, presence of dactylitis and  enthesitis, and HAQ-DI) matched those in the FUTURE trials. Response rates relative  to placebo and incremental costs per responder (CPR) over 24 weeks for ACR 20/50/70  and PASI 75/90 were compared between adalimumab and secukinumab 150 and 300 mg from  the German social health insurance (SHI) perspective. RESULTS: After matching, mean  baseline characteristics were balanced across the ADEPT and the FUTURE I and II  populations. The mean differences between adalimumab and secukinumab 150 mg in  relative ACR 20/50/70 and PASI 75/90 response rates were 9.5, 3.0, 6.0, 13.1, and  6.7%, respectively (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Post-match relative ACR 20/50/70  and PASI 75 to placebo were also higher with adalimumab compared to secukinumab  300 mg. Adalimumab had lower incremental costs per responder over 24 weeks for all  outcomes compared with secukinumab 150 and 300 mg. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of  direct comparisons between adalimumab and secukinumab, this study provides valuable  and reliable evidence for physicians and payers. After adjusting for cross-trial  differences in baseline characteristics, adalimumab was associated with higher  relative ACR and PASI rates and lower incremental CPRs compared with secukinumab  150 mg or 300 mg at week 24 among patients with active PsA.

We sought to compare the efficacy of commonly used silver delivery  approaches including nanocrystalline silver, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing,  and silver-impregnated foam dressing as the main products in the management of  partial thickness burns. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed,  EMBASE, Cochrane, and other databases to identify relevant randomized controlled  trials and observational studies. Due to the paucity of direct head-to-head trials,  an indirect treatment comparison was performed. The use of nanocrystalline silver  was associated with a statistically significant reduction in length of stay when  compared to silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing (p = 0.027) and a shorter time to  healing when compared to silver-impregnated foam dressing (p = 0.0328). There were  no statistically significant differences in infection rates and surgical procedures  between nanocrystalline silver, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, and  silver-impregnated foam dressing; however, nanocrystalline silver was found to be  the most beneficial for all the outcomes, including infection rates and surgical  procedures, according to the Monte Carlo simulation method. In conclusion, current  evidence from the published literature suggests that where the clinical and  microbiological priority is to get in control of infection quickly it would seem  prudent to use the most potent silver delivery system, which is nanocrystalline  silver. Nanocrystalline silver may offer both clinical and economic benefits  compared to alternative treatments in the management of patients with mixed burns  that are at high risk of infection.","© 2017 The Authors.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 is associated with faster disease  progression and has fewer treatment options, historically, than other HCV genotypes.  This analysis aims to estimate the comparative cost-effectiveness of two recently  licenced interferon-free regimens for the treatment of HCV genotype 3. METHODS:  Utilising a published Markov model and results of a matching-adjusted indirect  comparison of recently published clinical trial data (ALLY-3 and VALENCE,  respectively), 12 weeks of treatment with daclatasvir + sofosbuvir (DCV + SOF) was  compared to 24 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir + ribavirin (SOF + RBV).  UK-specific model inputs were used to inform a cost-utility analysis of these  regimens. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, DCV + SOF was found to be dominant  over SOF + RBV in treatment-naïve patients, patients that had previously been  treated, and patients that are intolerant to, or ineligible for,  interferon-containing regimens. Given the low rates of treatment currently observed  in the UK, DCV + SOF was also compared to no treatment in the  interferon-ineligible/intolerant patients, and may be considered cost-effective with  an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £8817. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to  24 weeks of SOF + RBV, 12 weeks of treatment with DCV + SOF results in improved  quality of life and reduced total costs, and therefore is likely to represent  significant clinical and economic value as a treatment option for genotype 3 HCV  infection.",NA,"McEwan, Phil Webster, Samantha Ward, Thomas Brenner, Michael Kalsekar, Anupama Yuan, Yong",McEwan P Webster S Ward T Brenner M Kalsekar A Yuan Y,NA,"Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd, 9 Oak Tree Court, Mulberry Drive, Cardiff  Gate Business Park, Cardiff, CF23 8RS UK.

In such cases, a network  meta-analysis model including treatment by covariate interactions can estimate the  relative effects of all treatment pairings for each subgroup of patients. Two key  assumptions underlie such models: consistency of treatment effects and consistency  of the regression coefficients for the interactions. Consistency may differ  depending on the covariate value at which consistency is assessed. For valid  inference, we need to be confident of consistency for the relevant range of  covariate values. In this paper, we demonstrate how to assess consistency of  treatment effects from direct and indirect evidence at various covariate values.  METHODS: Consistency is assessed using visual inspection, inconsistency estimates,  and probabilities. The method is applied to an individual patient dataset comparing  artemisinin combination therapies for treating uncomplicated malaria in children  using the covariate age. RESULTS: The magnitude of the inconsistency appears to be  decreasing with increasing age for each comparison. For one comparison, direct and  indirect evidence differ for age 1 (P = .05), and this brings results for age 1 for  all comparisons into question. CONCLUSION: When fitting models including  interactions, the consistency of direct and indirect evidence must be assessed  across the range of covariates included in the trials. Clinical inferences are only  valid for covariate values for which results are consistent.",© 2017 The Authors.

There are no direct-comparison  studies with paliperidone palmitate (PP; long-acting antipsychotic used most often  in acute settings) for the acute psychotic episode. OBJECTIVES: To indirectly  compare efficacy and safety of the pivotal AL study with all PP studies meeting  indirect comparison criteria. METHODS: Systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase,  Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials  Registry Platform, and gray literature were performed to identify randomized  controlled trials of PP with similar designs to the AL trial. Bayesian network  meta-analysis compared treatments with respect to symptom response and tolerability  issues including weight gain, akathisia, parkinsonism, and likelihood of  treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Three appropriate PP studies were  identified for indirect comparison. Both doses of AL (441 mg and 882 mg monthly)  were used and compared with two efficacious doses of PP (156 mg and 234 mg monthly).  All four active-treatment conditions were associated with comparable reductions in  acute symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) versus placebo and were of  similar magnitude (range of mean difference -8.12 to -12.01, with overlapping 95%  credible intervals). Between-group comparisons of active-treatment arms were  associated with summary estimates of magnitude near 0. No clinically meaningful  differences in selected safety or tolerability parameter incidence were found  between active treatments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that both AL and PP  are effective for treatment of adults experiencing acute exacerbation of  schizophrenia.",Copyright © 2017 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  (ISPOR).

Comparing the BT post-treatment period to ongoing treatment with  OM, showed no significant differences in the rate ratios (RRs) for severe  exacerbations (RR of BT versus OM = 0.91 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.30]; p = 0.62) or  hospitalizations (RR = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.17, 1.86]; p = 0.53); emergency department  visits were significantly reduced by 75% with BT (RR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.91]; p  = 0.04); the proportions of patients with clinically meaningful response on the  asthma quality-of-life questionnaire were comparable (RR = 1.06 [95% CI: 0.86,  1.34]; p = 0.59). The RR for exacerbations statistically favours OM over the total  study period in AIR2 (RR = 1.50 [95% CI: 1.11, 2.02]; p = 0.009) likely reflecting a  transient increase in events during the BT peri-treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The  ITC should be interpreted cautiously considering the differences between patient  populations in the included trials. However, based on the analysis, BT compares well  with a potentially more costly pharmacotherapy for asthma. Clinicians evaluating the  relative merits of using these treatments should consider the totality of evidence  and patient preferences to make an informed decision.",NA,"Niven, Robert M Simmonds, Michael R Cangelosi, Michael J Tilden, Dominic P Cottrell, Suzanne Shargill, Narinder S",Niven RM Simmonds MR Cangelosi MJ Tilden DP Cottrell S Shargill NS,NA,"a MAHSC, University of Manchester and University Hospital of South Manchester ,  Manchester , UK. b Boston Scientific , Sydney , NSW , Australia. c Boston Scientific , Marlborough , MA , USA. d Thema Consulting Pty Ltd , Sydney , NSW , Australia. d Thema Consulting Pty Ltd , Sydney , NSW , Australia. c Boston Scientific , Marlborough , MA , USA.",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Systematic Review",20170714,England,J Asthma,The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,8106454,IM,NOTNLM,*Comparative effectiveness *GINA Step 5 *indirect treatment comparison *informed decision *systematic literature review,2017/07/15 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,2017/07/15 06:00,2017/07/15 06:00 [pubmed] 2019/03/26 06:00 [medline] 2017/07/15 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/02770903.2017.1337789 [doi],ppublish,J Asthma. 2018 Apr;55(4):443-451. doi: 10.1080/02770903.2017.1337789.

There is currently no recommended therapy for  second-line AGC in the UK despite the availability of various interventions. This  paper aims to compare different interventions for treatment of second-line AGC using  more complex methods to estimate relative efficacy, fitting various parametric  models and to compare results to those published adopting conventional methods of  synthesis. METHODS: Seven studies were identified in an existing literature review  evaluating seven comparators, which formed a connected network of evidence.  Citations were limited to randomised controlled trials in previously-treated AGC  patients. Evidence quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool.  Studies were assessed for the availability of Kaplan-Meier curves for overall  survival. Individual patient data (IPD) were recreated using digitisation software  along with a published algorithm in R. The data were analysed using  multi-dimensional network meta-analysis (NMA) methods. A series of parametric models  were fitted to the pseudo-IPD. Both fixed and random-effects models were fitted to  explore long-term survival prospects based on extrapolation methods and estimated  mean survival. RESULTS: Relative efficacy estimates were compared to those  previously reported, which utilised conventional NMA methods. Results presented were  consistent within findings from other publications and identified ramucirumab plus  paclitaxel as the best treatment; however, all the treatments assessed were  associated with poor survival prospects with mean survival estimates ranging from  5.0 to 12.7 months. CONCLUSION: Whilst the approach adopted in this paper does not  adjust for differences in trial patient populations and is particularly  data-intensive, use of such sophisticated methods of evidence synthesis may be more  informative for subsequent cost-effectiveness modelling and may have greater impact  when considering an indication where observed data is particularly immature or  survival prospects are more positive, which may then lead to more informative  decision-making for drug reimbursement.",NA,"Harvey, Rebecca C",Harvey RC,NA,"Tolley Health Economics Ltd, Unit 5, 11-13 Eagle Parade, Buxton, Derbyshire SK17 6EQ  UK.",eng,NA,Journal Article,20170606,NA,Oncol Ther,Oncology and therapy,101677510,NA,NOTNLM,Advanced gastric cancer Bayesian Evidence synthesis Network meta-analysis Parametric modelling,2017/07/07 06:00,2017/07/07 06:01,2017/07/07 06:00,2017/04/10 00:00 [received] 2017/07/07 06:00 [entrez] 2017/07/07 06:00 [pubmed] 2017/07/07 06:01 [medline],48 [pii] 10.1007/s40487-017-0048-0 [doi],ppublish,Oncol Ther. 2017;5(1):53-67. doi: 10.1007/s40487-017-0048-0.

This paper  reviews the efficacy and tolerability of switching to vortioxetine. All three  published studies of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) switched from  SSRI/SNRI therapy to vortioxetine due to lack of efficacy or tolerability were  selected. Vortioxetine was evaluated versus agomelatine directly (REVIVE) and versus  sertraline, venlafaxine, bupropion, and citalopram in an indirect treatment  comparison (ITC) from switch studies retrieved in a literature review.  Vortioxetine׳s impact on SSRI-induced treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD)  was assessed directly versus escitalopram (NCT01364649) in stable patients with MDD.  Vortioxetine׳s tolerability in the switch population was compared to the overall MDD  population. Vortioxetine showed significant benefits over agomelatine on efficacy,  functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes, with fewer withdrawals due to adverse  events (AEs) (REVIVE). Vortioxetine had numerically higher remission rates versus  all therapies included (ITC). Withdrawal rates due to AEs were significantly lower  for vortioxetine versus sertraline, venlafaxine, and bupropion, and numerically  lower versus citalopram. Switching to vortioxetine was statistically superior to  escitalopram in improving TESD (NCT01364649). Tolerability was similar in the switch  and overall MDD populations. These findings suggest that vortioxetine is an  effective switch therapy for patients with MDD whose response to SSRI/SNRI therapy  is inadequate. Vortioxetine was well tolerated and, for patients with a history of  TESD, showed significant advantages versus escitalopram. Vortioxetine appears to be  a valid option for patients with MDD who have not been effectively treated with  first-line pharmacotherapies.",Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

As efficacy and safety rates converge, prescribers  and payers need to consider value for money. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the health  economic value of daclatasvir + asunaprevir versus sofosbuvir/ledipasvir via a  cost-effectiveness analysis, and determine the optimal treatment considering both  costs and health outcomes in Japan. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was  used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir + asunaprevir compared with  sofosbuvir/ledipasvir on the basis of a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of  pivotal trials and modeling inputs specific to the Japanese setting. A de novo  budget impact model was developed and used to predict the cost implications of  differing treatment sequences. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness results demonstrated  minimal difference in terms of benefit (0.037 fewer QALYs and 0.014 fewer life-years  with daclatasvir + asunaprevir); nevertheless, a significant difference in cost was  predicted (estimated ¥2,299,700 [US $21,695] reduction with daclatasvir +  asunaprevir). The budget impact analysis estimated that treatment with daclatasvir +  asunaprevir is expected to be less expensive than treatment with  sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (as the proportion of patients initially treated with  sofosbuvir/ledipasvir increased from 0% to 100%, total costs increased from ¥206 to  ¥403 billion [US $1.94 billion to US $3.80 billion]). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of  results from an established cost-effectiveness model and a conventional budget  impact analysis, treatment with daclatasvir + asunaprevir is expected to be  cost-saving compared with treatment with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in Japan with similar  health outcomes, regardless of treatment sequence.",Copyright © 2017 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  (ISPOR).

Two broad approaches are  available to synthesise data across networks, namely, arm- and contrast-synthesis  models, with a range of models that can be fitted within each. There has been recent  debate about the validity of the arm-synthesis models, but to date, there has been  limited empirical evaluation comparing results using the methods applied to a large  number of networks. We aim to address this gap through the re-analysis of a large  cohort of published networks of interventions using a range of network meta-analysis  methods. METHODS: We will include a subset of networks from a database of network  meta-analyses of randomised trials that have been identified and curated from the  published literature. The subset of networks will include those where the primary  outcome is binary, the number of events and participants are reported for each  direct comparison, and there is no evidence of inconsistency in the network. We will  re-analyse the networks using three contrast-synthesis methods and two arm-synthesis  methods. We will compare the estimated treatment effects, their standard errors,  treatment hierarchy based on the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve,  the SUCRA value, and the between-trial heterogeneity variance across the network  meta-analysis methods. We will investigate whether differences in the results are  affected by network characteristics and baseline risk. DISCUSSION: The results of  this study will inform whether, in practice, the choice of network meta-analysis  method matters, and if it does, in what situations differences in the results  between methods might arise. The results from this research might also inform future  simulation studies.",NA,"Karahalios, Amalia Emily Salanti, Georgia Turner, Simon L Herbison, G Peter White, Ian R Veroniki, Areti Angeliki Nikolakopoulou, Adriani Mckenzie, Joanne E",Karahalios AE Salanti G Turner SL Herbison GP White IR Veroniki AA Nikolakopoulou A Mckenzie JE,NA,"School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, level 1, 549 St  Kilda Road, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Nonsurgical procedures such as  uterine artery embolization (UAE) have been developed. The goal of this study was to  conduct a meta-analysis and an indirect treatment comparison to examine the  comparative efficacy and safety of the surgical procedures to treat SULs compared  with UAE. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Lilacs, and the Cochrane Central Register of  Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to February 2016. Ten  randomized controlled trials comparing UAE versus hysterectomy, myomectomy, and  laparoscopic occlusion of the uterine arteries in patients with SUL published in a  peer-reviewed journal were included. Two reviewers independently selected studies,  assessed quality, and extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus.  FINDINGS: Data from 986 patients submitted to UEA (n = 527) or surgery (n = 459)  were analyzed. UAE had a lower risk of major complications (risk ratio [RR], 0.45  [95% CI, 0.22-0.95]; P = 0.04)and a higher risk of minor complications (RR, 1.65  [95% CI, 1.32-2.06]; P < 0.00001); UAE had a higher risk of re-intervention up to 2  years (RR, 3.74 [95% CI, 1.76-7.96]; P = 0.0006) and up to 5 years (RR, 5.01 [95%  CI, 1.37-18.39]; P = 0.02); UAE had a similar risk of follicle-stimulating hormone  levels >40 IU/L after 6 months (RR, 1.76 [95% CI, 0.24-12.95]; P = 0.58)and of  recommending the procedure to another patient up to 5 years after treatment (RR,  1.00 [95% CI, 0.87-1.14]; P = 0.94). The indirect comparison between myomectomy and  hysterectomy found that the 2 procedures were similar in the studied outcomes.  IMPLICATIONS: Compared with surgery, UAE had lower rates of major complications with  an increased risk of re-intervention up to 2 and 5 years after the first procedure.  UAE compared with surgery had a similar risk of ovarian failure and similar  recommendation of the procedure to another patient. However, the number of trials  was limited, and there was a high risk of bias in at least 2 domains. None of the  trials blinded the participants and personnel or the outcome assessment.

The current meta-analysis compared the  neutropenia-related efficacy and safety of lipegfilgrastim to those of pegfilgrastim  and filgrastim. Methods Embase was searched for trials examining the efficacy/safety  of lipegfilgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or filgrastim. Outcomes included febrile  neutropenia, severe neutropenia, duration of severe neutropenia, time to recovery of  absolute neutrophil count, and incidence of bone pain. Direct comparisons were made  using random-effects models. No trials directly compared lipegfilgrastim and  filgrastim. Indirect comparisons were made between lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim  with pegfilgrastim as the common comparator. Results This meta-analysis included a  total of 5769 patients from 24 studies. Over all cycles, lipegfilgrastim showed a  lower, nonsignificant risk of febrile neutropenia compared with pegfilgrastim.  Lipegfilgrastim has a lower risk of febrile neutropenia versus filgrastim but was  also not statistically significant. The risk ratio for severe neutropenia in cycle 1  was 0.80, a 20% reduction in favor of lipegfilgrastim. For cycles 2-4, the risk  ratio was 0.53 (0.35, 0.79) for lipegfilgrastim versus pegfilgrastim. The risk of  severe neutropenia in cycles 2-4 was also significantly lower for lipegfilgrastim  (risk ratio 0.45, 0.27, 0.75, respectively). No significant differences were found  for febrile neutropenia and severe neutropenia in cycle 1. However, in cycles 2-4,  lipegfilgrastim was associated with significant and clinically meaningful reductions  in risk of severe neutropenia versus either pegfilgrastim or filgrastim.

Vismodegib, the other approved targeted therapy,  also was assessed in a single-arm trial (ERIVANCE). We examined the comparative  effectiveness of the two drugs using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC)  versus an unadjusted indirect comparison. METHODS: After comparing trials and  identifying potential prognostic factors, an MAIC was conducted to adjust for  differences in key patient baseline characteristics. Due to BOLT's small sample  size, the number of matching variables was restricted to two. Efficacy results for  sonidegib were generated so that selected baseline characteristics matched those  from ERIVANCE and were compared with published ERIVANCE results. RESULTS: Matching  variables were baseline percentages of patients receiving prior radiotherapy and  surgery. After weighting, sonidegib objective response rate (ORR) and median  progression-free survival (PFS) were effectively unchanged (prematched versus  postmatched ORR and PFS, 56.1% versus 56.7% and 22.1 versus 22.1 months, resp.).  Vismodegib's ORR and PFS were 47.6% and 9.5 months.

Many  therapeutic agents have been approved for patients with metastatic  castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), particularly as a post-docetaxel  treatment strategy. The objective of this systematic literature review was to assess  published efficacy and safety data for select mCRPC therapies - such as abiraterone,  cabazitaxel, and enzalutamide - in the post-docetaxel setting. METHODS: Database  searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL, in conjunction with hand searches  of multiple congress abstracts, yielded 13 randomized studies and 107 non-randomized  studies that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Randomized studies demonstrated  significant improvements in median overall survival (OS) outcomes over placebo for  abiraterone (15.8 vs. 11.2 months) and enzalutamide (18.4 vs. 13.6 months), and  similar significant improvements were noted for cabazitaxel over mitoxantrone (15.1  vs. 12.7 months). Differences in progression-free survival (PFS) were similarly  significant, although variance in the criteria for measuring PFS may limit the  extent to which these outcomes can be compared between studies. Non-randomized  evidence included multiple publications from several early access and compassionate  use programs with a primary objective to report safety outcomes. Results from these  studies largely reflected the findings in randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,  there is a growing body of evidence for post-docetaxel treatment options available  in patients with mCRPC. Further head-to-head trials or indirect treatment  comparisons may be a valuable method to assess the comparative efficacy of these  therapies.",NA,"Summers, Nicholas Vanderpuye-Orgle, Jacqueline Reinhart, Marcia Gallagher, Meghan Sartor, Oliver",Summers N Vanderpuye-Orgle J Reinhart M Gallagher M Sartor O,NA,"a Precision Health Economics , Los Angeles , CA , USA. a Precision Health Economics , Los Angeles , CA , USA. b Tantalus Medical Communications , Victoria , BC , Canada. c Sanofi , Cambridge , MA , USA. d Tulane University Department of Urology , New Orleans , LA , USA.",eng,NA,Journal Article Review Systematic Review,20170710,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,NOTNLM,*Metastatic prostate cancer *castration resistant *hormone refractory *prostatic neoplasms *systematic review,2017/06/13 06:00,2018/04/11 06:00,2017/06/13 06:00,2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed] 2018/04/11 06:00 [medline] 2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/03007995.2017.1341869 [doi],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2017 Nov;33(11):1995-2008. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2017.1341869.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We  conducted a meta-epidemiological survey using a systematic review of NMAs published  in 2013 and identified through MEDLINE and Embase databases. RESULTS: The review  identified 77 NMAs. The most common type of effect modifiers identified and explored  were patient characteristics (50.7% or 39/77), and the most common adjustment method  used was sensitivity analysis (51.7% or 30/58). Over 45% (35/77) of studies did not  describe a plan, nearly 40% (30/77) did not report the results of analyses, and  approximately 47% (36/77) of studies had incomplete reporting. Exploratory  univariate regression analyses yielded a statistically significant association for  the variables of journal impact factor, ratio of randomized controlled trials to  number of comparisons, and total number of randomized controlled trials. CONCLUSION:  Current reporting practices are largely deficient, given that almost half of  identified published NMAs do not explore or report effect modification.

No trials directly comparing their efficacy are available. Therefore  a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to provide insight into  their relative efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall  survival (OS). MAIC attempts to adjust for between-trial differences in factors  known or suspected to influence treatment effects, to minimize bias. METHODS: A MAIC  within a Bayesian framework was conducted using individual patient data from the  RESONATE-2 study of ibr versus chlorambucil and published data from the CLL11 study  of obi versus chlorambucil. Both studies were conducted in patients ineligible for  full-dose fludarabine-based therapy. After matching, the reweighted adjusted  relative efficacy measure of ibr versus chlorambucil from RESONATE-2 [hazard ratio  (HR), 95% credible interval (CrI)] was compared with that of obi versus chlorambucil  from CLL11 for each endpoint, using a Bayesian indirect comparison. RESULTS: Our  results suggest that in a population with similar average baseline characteristics  to CLL11, ibr would improve PFS and OS outcomes compared to obi. Before matching,  the HRs for ibr versus obi were 0.48 [CrI = 0.22-1.02, p(HR <1) = 97%], 0.85  [CrI = 0.44-1.63, p(HR <1) = 69%], and 0.40 [CrI = 0.10-1.54, p(HR <1) = 91%] for  PFS by investigator assessment, PFS by independent review committee, and OS,  respectively. After matching on all available characteristics the HRs decreased to  0.12 [CrI = 0.02-0.97, p(HR <1) = 98%], 0.24 [CrI = 0.04-1.35, p(HR <1) = 95%], and  0.21 [CrI = <0.01-8.89, p(HR <1) = 79%], respectively. There was a large variance  around the treatment effect for OS due to the low number of deaths. CONCLUSION: Our  analysis suggests that ibrutinib is highly likely to provide greater PFS benefit  than obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in older or less fit patients with previously  untreated CLL. There is also an indication of improvement in OS, albeit with a  higher uncertainty due to the low number of events.

RESULTS: Higher FIX activity showed reduced ABRs (p < 0.001). Target  joints resulted in higher bleed rates (p < 0.001). When FIX activity levels and  bleed risks were applied to the Markov model, ABRs for nonacog beta pegol and its  comparator were 2.40 and 6.36, respectively.

Mycoflora analysis  of the dry fruits revealed Aspergillus favus LHP-PV-1 as the most aflatoxigenic  isolate with highest Aflatoxin B(1) content. M. cardiaca EO showed broad fungitoxic  spectrum inhibiting the tested moulds contaminating dry fruits. It's minimum  inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum aflatoxin inhibitory concentration (MAIC)  and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) against A. favus LHP-PV-1 were recorded  to be 1.25, 1.0 and 2.25 µL/mL respectively. The EO caused decrease in ergosterol  content and enhanced leakage of Ca(2+), K(+) and Mg(2+) ions from treated fungal  cells, depicting fungal plasma membrane as the site of antifungal action. The EO  showed promising DPPH free radical scavenging activity (IC(50) value:15.89 µL/mL)  and favourable safety profile with LD(50) value (7133.70 mg/kg body wt.) when  estimated through acute oral toxicity on mice. Carvone (61.62%) was recorded as the  major component of the oil during chemical characterisation through GC-MS.

Because previous meta-analyses only  included a limited number of adjusted studies or several non-adjusted studies, our  goal was to compare and summarize the outcomes of TF-TAVI vs SAVR and TF-TAVI vs  TA-TAVI exclusively with the RCT and propensity-matched cohort studies with direct  and adjusted indirect comparisons to reach more precise conclusions. We hypothesized  that TF-TAVI would offer surgical candidates a better outcome compared with SAVR and  TA-TAVI because of its potential for fewer myocardial injuries. A literature search  was conducted through PUBMED and EMBASE through June 2016. Only RCTs and  propensity-matched cohort studies were included. A direct meta-analysis of TF-TAVI  vs SAVR, TA-TAVI vs SAVR and TF-TAVI vs TA-TAVI was conducted. Then, the effect size  of an indirect meta-analysis was calculated from the direct meta-analysis. The  effect sizes of direct and indirect meta-analyses were then combined. A  random-effects model was used to calculate the hazards ratio and the odds ratio with  95% confidence intervals. Early (in-hospital or 30 days) and mid-term (≥1 year)  all-cause mortality rates were assessed. Our search resulted in 4 RCTs (n = 2319)  and 14 propensity-matched cohort (n = 7217) studies with 9536 patients of whom 3471,  1769 and 4296 received TF, TA and SAVR, respectively. Direct meta-analyses and  combined direct and indirect meta-analyses of early and mid-term deaths with TF-TAVI  and SAVR were similar. Early deaths with TF-TAVI vs TA-TAVI were comparable in  direct meta-analyses (odds ratio 0.64, P = 0.35) and direct and indirect  meta-analyses combined (odds ratio 0.73, P = 0.24). Mid-term deaths with TF-TAVI vs  TA-TAVI were increased (hazard ratio 0.83, P = 0.07) in a direct meta-analysis and  became significant after addition of the indirect meta-analysis (hazard ratio 0.78,  95% confidence interval 0.67-0.92, P = 0.003). In conclusion, TF-TAVI was associated  with similar early and mid-term deaths compared with SAVR. The number of early  deaths was not significantly different between TF-TAVI and TA-TAVI, whereas there  were fewer mid-term deaths with TF-TAVI than with TA-TAVI.",© The Author 2017.

To  synthesize the evidence and provide the hierarchies of different circumcisions for  phimosis and redundant prepuce, we performed an overall network meta-analysis (NMA)  based on their comparative efficacy and safety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic  databases including PubMed, Embase, Wan Fang, VIP, CNKI and CBM database were  researched from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for redundant prepuce or  phimosis. We conducted the direct and indirect comparisons by aggregate data drug  information system (ADDIS) software. Moreover, consistency models were applied to  assess the differences among the male circumcision practices, and the ranks based on  probabilities of intervention for the different endpoints were performed.  Node-splitting analysis was used to test inconsistency. RESULTS: Eighteen RCTs were  included with 6179 participants. Compared with the conventional circumcision(CC),  two new styles of circumcisions, the disposable circumcision suture device(DCSD) and  Shang Ring circumcision(SRC), provided significantly shorter operation time[DCSD:  standardized mean difference (SMD) = -20.60, 95% credible interval(CI)  (-23.38, -17.82); SRC: SMD = -19.16, 95%CI (-21.86, -16.52)], shorter wound healing  time [DCSD:SMD = -4.19, 95%CI (-8.24,-0.04); SRC: SMD = 4.55, 95%CI (1.62, 7.57); ]  and better postoperative penile appearance [DCSD: odds ratios odds ratios  (OR) = 11.42, 95%CI (3.60, 37.68); SRC: OR = 3.85,95%CI (1.29, 12.79)].  Additionally, DCSD showed a lower adverse events rate than other two treatments.  However, no significant difference was shown in all surgeries for 24 h postoperative  pain score. Node-splitting analysis showed that no significant inconsistency was  existed (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of NMA, DCSD may be a most  effective and safest choice for phimosis and redundant prepuce. DCSD has the  advantages of a shorter operation time, better postoperative penile appearance,  fewer complication and shorter wound healing time. However, with the limitations of  our study, additional multi-center RCTs are needed to evaluate the outcomes.",Copyright © 2017.

However, bioequivalence assessment for regulatory approval among generics of the  innovative drug product is not required. In practice, approved generics are often  used interchangeably without any mechanism of safety monitoring. In this article,  based on indirect comparisons, we proposed several methods to assessing  bioequivalence and interchangeability between generics. The applicability of the  methods and the similarity assumptions were discussed, as well as the  inappropriateness of directly adopting adjusted indirect comparison to the field of  generics' comparison. Besides, some extensions were given to take into consideration  the important topics in clinical trials for bioequivalence assessments, for example,  multiple comparisons and simultaneously testing bioequivalence among three generics.  Extensive simulation studies were conducted to investigate the performances of the  proposed methods. The studies of malaria generics and HIV/AIDS generics prequalified  by the WHO were used as real examples to demonstrate the use of the methods.

This study compared the efficacy of  daratumumab monotherapy versus historical controls through adjusted treatment  comparison. Patient-level data were pooled from two daratumumab monotherapy studies  (16 mg/kg; GEN501 and SIRIUS) and two independent US databases (IMS LifeLink and  OPTUM), which reflect treatments used in real-world patients with MM who received ≥3  prior LOTs or were double refractory to a PI and an IMiD. Using a multivariate  proportional hazards regression model, the relative treatment effect of daratumumab  versus historical controls was estimated, adjusting for imbalances in  characteristics between cohorts. Baseline characteristics that differed between  patients treated with daratumumab (N = 148) and historical control (N = 658) were  prior treatment with pomalidomide (55% vs 15%) or carfilzomib (41% vs 28%) and  triple/quadruple refractory status (64% vs 14%). The adjusted overall  survival-hazard ratio (OS-HR) for daratumumab versus historical control was 0.33  (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.46) compared with 0.46 (0.35-0.59) for unadjusted  HR. Impact of adjustment was mainly driven by refractory status and prior  pomalidomide/carfilzomib exposure. This adjusted treatment comparison suggests that  daratumumab demonstrates improved OS compared with historical control data in  heavily pretreated and highly refractory MM patients.","© 2017 The Authors American Journal of Hematology Published by Wiley Periodicals,  Inc.","Usmani, Saad Z Diels, Joris Ito, Tetsuro Mehra, Maneesha Khan, Imran Lam, Annette",Usmani SZ Diels J Ito T Mehra M Khan I Lam A,ORCID: 0000-0003-2037-3464,"Levine Cancer Institute/Carolinas Health Care System, Charlotte, North Carolina.

At least 30% patients with a confirmed  HGPIN will develop prostate cancer within 1 year after repeated biopsy. HGPIN  patients are the appropriate at-risk population for chemoprevention strategies  investigation against prostate cancer. However the commonly used chemoprevention  agents that targeted on hormonal imbalance or lifestyle-related factors showed  varied results in HGPIN patients. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted in  PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library according to Cochrane guidelines before January  31st, 2017. Direct meta-analysis were performed to summarize the efficacy of  candidate chemopreventative agents Dutasteride, Flutamide, Toremifene, Selenium,  Green tea components, Lycopene and natural food products combination. Adjusted  indirect meta-analyses were employed to compare the relative efficacy of these  candidate chemoprevention agents head-to-head. RESULTS: The overall incidence of  prostate cancer in HGPIN was slightly decreased by chemoprevention agents (25.7% vs  31.5%, RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.83-1.03, P = 0.183), with minor heterogeneity (I2 =  22.3%, ð2 = 15.08, P = 0.237), but without statistical significance. Subgroup  analysis showed that green tea catechins significantly decreased prostate cancer in  HGPIN patients (7.60% vs 23.1%, RR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.16-10.97, P P = 0.044), with  moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 47.9%, ð2 = 1.92, P = 0.166). The adjusted indirect  meta-analysis favored green tea catechins over other chemoprevention agents, and  significantly when compared to natural food products combination (RR = 0.355, 95%  CI: 0.134-0.934).

The objective of the study was to  investigate the potential for early vocational rehabilitation (VR) interventions for  people with spinal cord injury (SCI) in overcoming barriers in returning to work,  and to pinpoint factors contributing to effectiveness in early VR intervention for  this population. The setting was at Queensland, Australia. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Synthesis of the findings of a literature search of online databases ProQuest and  CINAHL, using keywords relating to the employment situation and VR of people with  SCI. Themes were identified and analysed in accordance with the research objectives.  RESULTS: Despite increasing government commitment to the workforce and social  participation of people with disabilities, Australians living with SCI have  significantly diminished employment outcomes compared with the general population.  Current VR approaches usually do not commence until some months post discharge,  potentially missing a window of opportunity to preserve pre-existing employment or  assist in vocational decision making. The review found that there are opportunities  for enhancing VR service provision following SCI, namely integrating the VR  programme within the primary rehabilitation team thus facilitating early VR  intervention. DISCUSSION: Emerging evidence shows promising results for early  intervention in VR; however, questions remain regarding ideal intervention  approaches, and it is clear that further empirical investigation is required to  support the use of early intervention models post SCI. The study was sponsored by  Motor Accident Insurance Commission (MAIC).",NA,"Bloom, Julia Dorsett, Pat McLennan, Vanette",Bloom J Dorsett P McLennan V,ORCID: 0000-0002-1107-4377,"School of Allied Health, Griffith University , Meadowbrook, Queensland, Australia.

METHODS: The literature search was conducted using  the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Keywords used were ""BPH,"" ""tamsulosin,""  ""placebo."" Experimental groups were defined as tamsulosin 0.2 mg (Tam 0.2) and 0.4  mg (Tam 0.4) and common control group was defined as placebo for indirect treatment  comparison. Mixed treatment comparison was performed including one direct comparison  study. RESULTS: Seven studies met the eligible criteria. Indirect treatment  comparison revealed that total International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) and  quality of life score of IPSS were not significantly different in Tam 0.2 and Tam  0.4 (P>0.05). There was no significant difference of maximal flow rate and postvoid  residual urine volume in Tam 0.2 and Tam 0.4 (P>0.05). Mixed treatment comparison  including one direct comparison study showed inconsistency (P<0.001). Therefore,  analysis using direct treatment comparison effect sizes of Tam 0.2 vs. placebo and  Tam 0.4 vs. placebo was done and there was no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS:  Network meta-analysis showed no difference of efficacy between tamsulosin 0.2 mg and  0.4 mg and the evidence of tamsulosin 0.4 mg as initial dose for Asian BPH patient  seems to be insufficient. Therefore, initial dose of tamsulosin for Asian BPH  patient should be 0.2 mg.",NA,"Kim, Su Jin Shin, In-Soo Eun, Sung-Jong Whangbo, Taeg-Keun Kim, Jin Wook Cho, Young Sam Kim, Joon Chul",Kim SJ Shin IS Eun SJ Whangbo TK Kim JW Cho YS Kim JC,ORCID: 0000-0002-1917-2780 ORCID: 0000-0001-7535-3511 ORCID: 0000-0003-3063-0452 ORCID: 0000-0003-1409-0580 ORCID: 0000-0003-4157-9365 ORCID: 0000-0002-2966-7971 ORCID: 0000-0002-4019-620X,"Department of Urology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea  College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

A Simulation Study for Time-to-event Endpoints.,10.3414/ME15-02-0016 [doi],"BACKGROUND: With the Act on the Reform of the Market for Medicinal Products (AMNOG)  in Germany, pharmaceutical manufacturers are obliged to submit a dossier  demonstrating added benefit of a new drug compared to an appropriate comparator.  Underlying evidence was planned for registration purposes and therefore often does  not meet the appropriate comparator as defined by the Federal Joint Committee  (G-BA). For this reason AMNOG allows indirect comparisons to assess the extent of  added benefit. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the characteristics  and applicability of adjusted indirect comparison described by Bucher and  Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) in various situations within the early  benefit assessment according to §35a Social Code Book 5. In particular, we consider  time-to-event endpoints. METHODS: We conduct a simulation study where we consider  three different scenarios: I) similar study populations, II) dissimilar study  populations without interactions and III) dissimilar study populations with  interactions between treatment effect and effect modifiers. We simulate data from a  Cox model with Weibull distributed survival times. Desired are unbiased effect  estimates. We compare the power and the proportion of type 1 errors of the methods.  RESULTS: I) Bucher and MAIC perform equivalently well and yield unbiased effect  estimates as well as proportions of type 1 errors below the significance level of  5 %. II) Both Bucher and MAIC yield unbiased effect estimates, but Bucher shows a  higher power for detection of true added benefit than MAIC. III) Only MAIC, but not  Bucher yields unbiased effect estimates. When using robust variance estimation MAIC  yields a proportion of type 1 error close to 5 %. In general, power of all methods  for indirect comparisons is low. An increasing loss of power for the indirect  comparisons can be observed as the true treatment effects decrease. CONCLUSION: Due  to the great loss of power and the potential bias for indirect comparisons,  head-to-head trials using the appropriate comparator as defined by the Federal Joint  Committee should be conducted whenever possible. However, indirect comparisons are  needed if no such direct evidence is available. To conduct indirect comparisons in  case of a present common comparator and similar study populations in the trials to  be compared, both Bucher and MAIC can be recommended. In case of using adjusted  effect measures (such as Hazard Ratio), the violation of the similarity assumption  has no relevant effect on the Bucher approach as long as interactions between  treatment effect and effect modifiers are absent. Therefore Bucher can still be  considered appropriate in this specific situation. In the authors' opinion, MAIC can  be considered as an option (at least as sensitivity analysis to Bucher) if such  interactions are present or cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, in practice MAIC is  potentially biased and should always be considered with utmost care.",NA,"Kühnast, Sarah Schiffner-Rohe, Julia Rahnenführer, Jörg Leverkus, Friedhelm",Kühnast S Schiffner-Rohe J Rahnenführer J Leverkus F,NA,"Sarah Kühnast, Pfizer Deutschland GmbH, Linkstr. 10, 10785 Berlin, Germany, E-Mail:  sarah.kuehnast@pfizer.com.",eng,NA,Comparative Study Evaluation Study Journal Article,20170331,Germany,Methods Inf Med,Methods of information in medicine,0210453,IM,NOTNLM,AMNOG Bucher Indirect comparisons MAIC dissimilarity,2017/04/01 06:00,2018/03/09 06:00,2017/04/01 06:00,2015/12/15 00:00 [received] 2017/01/23 00:00 [accepted] 2017/04/01 06:00 [pubmed] 2018/03/09 06:00 [medline] 2017/04/01 06:00 [entrez],15-02-0016 [pii] 10.3414/ME15-02-0016 [doi],ppublish,Methods Inf Med. 2017 May 18;56(3):261-267. doi: 10.3414/ME15-02-0016.

These two treatments have recently  been approved in the EU for the management of acute moderate-to-severe  post-operative pain in adult patients. METHODS: As no head-to-head trials comparing  SSTS and PCTS currently exist, indirect treatment comparison (ITC) analyses were  conducted to evaluate SSTS or PCTS versus intravenous (IV) morphine PCA. RESULTS:  Five studies, four assessing PCTS and one assessing SSTS, were included in this  analysis. SSTS had statistical or numerical advantages over PCTS for both patient  global assessment (PGA) and healthcare professional global assessment (HPGA)  outcomes at all time points investigated. SSTS was also associated with greater  patient ease of use (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 0.13; 95% confidence interval  [CI]: -0.02-0.28) and a higher patient satisfaction score (WMD: 0.31; 95% CI:  0.05-0.57; p = .019) compared with PCTS. In terms of tolerability, all-cause  withdrawals from treatment were reported to be less likely with SSTS (risk ratio:  0.65; 95% CI: 0.42-1.02). No significant differences were observed between SSTS and  PCTS in terms of safety and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of direct  head-to-head data, the combination of promising phase III trial results compared to  IV morphine PCA, a SLR comparison against other opioid treatments, and the results  of this exploratory analysis present a strong rationale in support of SSTS as a key  option for management of post-operative pain.",NA,"Katz, Pablo Takyar, Shweta Palmer, Pamela Liedgens, Hiltrud",Katz P Takyar S Palmer P Liedgens H,NA,"a Grünenthal GmbH , Aachen , Germany. b Parexel International , Chandigarh , UT , India. c AcelRx Pharmaceuticals , Redwood City , CA , USA. a Grünenthal GmbH , Aachen , Germany.",eng,NA,Comparative Study Journal Article,20170315,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,NOTNLM,*Analgesia *Iontophoresis *analgesics *fentanyl *opioid *pain *patient-controlled *post-operative *sufentanil *tablets,2017/03/16 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed] 2017/05/30 06:00 [medline] 2017/03/16 06:00 [entrez],10.1080/03007995.2017.1294560 [doi],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2017 May;33(5):911-918. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2017.1294560.

The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of this by  investigating whether innovative products from different countries are  bioequivalent. METHODS: Data were collected from all generic drug applications  received by the Taiwan regulatory authority 2012-2016. If a submission package  contained BE studies, that generic product was compared separately with different  reference products, and the resulting data included in this analysis. A method of  adjusted indirect comparison was used to evaluate the BE of reference products from  different sources. The relationship between in vitro dissolution and in vivo BE was  also explored. RESULTS: The present study included 10 drugs and a total of 11  comparisons. Seven comparisons for maximum concentration (C (max)) (63.6%) and all  comparisons (100.0%) for area under the curve up to last measurable time point (AUC)  complied with the BE criterion. Similar in vitro dissolution profiles were observed  in all comparisons. Among the comparisons that failed to demonstrate BE, only one  was considered to be possibly related to product difference, with point estimates of  indirect comparison for C (max) significantly greater than unity (22%). Discordance  between in vitro and in vivo observations was probably due to either drugs with  highly variable properties or a lack of discriminatory dissolution testing method.  CONCLUSIONS: Although this retrospective analysis only included a few drugs and  product formulation types, i.e., immediate release, delayed release, and orally  disintegrating tablet, these preliminary results suggest that using a foreign  reference product in BE studies for generic drug applications could be a feasible  approach, but with some restrictions: comparable dissolution profiles, same  innovator company, same size, weight, and type of coating as the domestic reference  product, etc. Further investigations for other complex formulations are required.",NA,"Wang, Yi-Lin Hsu, Li-Feng",Wang YL Hsu LF,NA,"Division of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE), 3F, No.465,  Sec.6, Zhongxiao E.

AIM: To assess the  relative cost-utility of the three DOACs compared with vitamin K antagonists.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model with 3-month cycles was used to simulate NVAF  patients starting with treatment and followed up for their lifetime from the  perspective of the National Health System. The model included 36 health states  including treatment combinations, disability and events history and considered a  hypothetical cohort of 10,000 NVAF patients. Relative efficacy was calculated from a  formal indirect treatment comparison using data from the pivotal trials of each  DOAC. RESULTS: Dabigatran was associated with the highest number of quality-adjusted  life years (QALY) (8.40 QALY), followed by apixaban (8.33 QALY), rivaroxaban (8.15  QALY) and acenocoumarol (8.03 QALY). Patients taking acenocoumarol had the lowest  total costs (€22,230), followed by dabigatran (€24,564), apixaban (€24,655) and  rivaroxaban (€25,900). Incremental cost-utility ratios compared to vitamin K  antagonists, were €6,397, €8,039 and €29,957/QALY for dabigatran, apixaban and  rivaroxaban, respectively. If compared together, dabigatran dominated apixaban and  rivaroxaban. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the baseline case.  CONCLUSIONS: All three direct anticoagulants are cost-effective against  acenocoumarol. Dabigatran is economically dominant over rivaroxaban and apixaban in  the Spanish setting, as it is more effective and cheaper.",NA,"Monreal-Bosch, M Soulard, S Crespo, C Brand, S Kansal, A",Monreal-Bosch M Soulard S Crespo C Brand S Kansal A,NA,"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Espana.

Tetrabenazine was assessed for treating chorea in the TETRA-HD trial,  and while efficacious, there are tolerability concerns possibly due to its  pharmacokinetic properties. Deutetrabenazine is a novel VMAT2 inhibitor that  contains deuterium, which extends active metabolite half-lives and minimizes drug  concentration fluctuations. In the First-HD trial, deutetrabenazine was efficacious  in treating chorea and was generally well tolerated. In the absence of a  head-to-head trial, we performed an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of the  tolerability of deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine for the treatment of  HD-associated chorea, as observed in the First-HD and TETRA-HD trials, using  well-established comparison methods. METHODS: Data from the Phase III, 12-week,  parallel-group, clinical trials First-HD (N = 90) and TETRA-HD (N = 84) were used to  conduct an ITC of the tolerability of deutetrabenazine versus tetrabenazine using  two anchor-based methods: Bucher comparison for unadjusted ITCs, and matching  indirect comparison for adjusted ITCs. Overall adverse events (AEs; mild, moderate,  and severe), serious AEs, specific AEs occurring in ≥10% of patients, and  discontinuations (all-cause and AE-related) were included in the analysis. The risk  differences of these outcomes for deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine were estimated  by subtracting the applicable placebo-adjusted risk in First-HD from that of  TETRA-HD. Sensitivity analyses were performed to address differences between trials,  and p-values were obtained from z-tests. RESULTS: Compared with tetrabenazine,  deutetrabenazine was associated with a significantly lower risk of moderate to  severe AEs and neuropsychiatric AEs including agitation, akathisia, depression,  depression/agitated depression, drowsiness/somnolence, insomnia, and parkinsonism in  both adjusted and unadjusted analyses (p < 0.05 for each). Deutetrabenazine had a  significantly lower rate of dose reduction or dose reduction/suspension in the  unadjusted and adjusted analyses (p < 0.001 for each). Deutetrabenazine resulted in  numerically more mild AEs, such as diarrhea and coughing; however, these results  were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This indirect treatment comparison  demonstrates that for the treatment of HD chorea, deutetrabenazine has a favorable  tolerability profile compared to tetrabenazine.

The National Institute of Clinical  Excellence issued two documents which give slightly varying algorithms of  pharmacotherapy for OAB, offering mirabegron as a possible treatment in certain  circumstances. In the absence of trials involving a direct comparison of therapies,  an indirect comparison can provide useful information on the difference in treatment  effects between competing interventions. OBJECTIVE: To compare effectiveness of  available medical therapies for OAB using Bucher indirect treatment comparison (ITC)  model. METHODS: A systematic literature search identified randomised controlled  trials (RCT) assessing effectiveness of drugs for OAB versus placebo. Then indirect  comparisons of the treatments effects were made, preserving the randomisation of the  originally assigned patient groups, using Bucher method. MAIN RESULTS: 25 RCTs met  inclusion criteria. In keeping with ITC method validity, four assessments were  undertaken of mirabegron against anticholinergics, which were number of incontinence  episodes, micturition episodes, urgency episodes in 24 h and volume of micturition.  This indirect treatment analysis suggests that mirabegron is as effective as  anticholinergics in managing of OAB, except for solifenacin which appears to be  superior. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that work looking into treatment  choice should be individualized to patient characteristics rather than fitting  patients to a treatment. Further work is required to identify what patient  characteristics may be crucial and indicate that studies exploring the most  effective sequence of managing treatment naïve patients and those with refractory  disease.","© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Obloza, Aneta Kirby, Joshua Yates, Derrick Toozs-Hobson, Philip",Obloza A Kirby J Yates D Toozs-Hobson P,NA,"Department of Urogynaecology, Leicester General Hospital, Leicester, UK.

Patients with both  eosinophilic and allergic asthma phenotypes may be eligible for treatment with  mepolizumab and omalizumab. Evidence on the relative effectiveness of these  treatments in this 'overlap' population would be informative for clinical and payer  decision making. METHODS: A systematic literature review and indirect treatment  comparison (Bayesian framework) were performed to assess the comparative  effectiveness and tolerability of mepolizumab and omalizumab, as add-ons to standard  of care. Studies included in the primary analysis were double-blind, randomized  controlled trials, ≥12 weeks' duration enrolling patients with severe asthma with a  documented exacerbation history and receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus  ≥1 additional controller. Two populations were examined: patients potentially  eligible for 1) both treatments (Overlap population) and 2) either treatment (Trial  population). RESULTS: In the Overlap population, no differences between treatments  in clinically significant exacerbations and exacerbations requiring hospitalization  were found, although trends favored mepolizumab (rate ratio [RR]:0.66 [95% credible  intervals (Crl):0.37,1.19]; 0.19[0.02,2.32], respectively). In the Trial population,  mepolizumab treatment produced greater reductions in clinically significant  exacerbations (RR:0.63 [95% CrI:0.45,0.89]) but not exacerbations requiring  hospitalization compared with omalizumab (RR:0.58 [95% Crl: 0.16,2.13]), although  the trend favored mepolizumab. Both treatments had broadly comparable effects on  lung function, and similar tolerability profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst this analysis  has limitations due to a restricted evidence base and residual heterogeneity, it  showed that in patients with severe asthma, mepolizumab seems to be at least as  effective as omalizumab and that the tolerability profiles of the two treatments did  not meaningfully differentiate.",Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The Cochrane Review which examined the  effect of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for chronic LBP concluded that SMT is  moderately effective, but was based on conventional meta-analysis of aggregate data.  The use of individual participant data (IPD) from trials allows for a more precise  estimate of the treatment effect and has the potential to identify moderators and/or  mediators. The aim is (1) to assess the overall treatment effect of SMT for primary  and secondary outcomes in adults with chronic LBP, (2) to determine possible  moderation of baseline characteristics on treatment effect, (3) to identify  characteristics of intervention (e.g., manipulation/mobilization) that influence the  treatment effect, and (4) to identify mediators of treatment effects. METHODS: All  trials included in the Cochrane Review on SMT for chronic LBP will be included which  were published after the year 2000, and the search will be updated. No restrictions  will be placed on the type of comparison or size of the study. Primary outcomes are  pain intensity and physical functioning. A dataset will be compiled consisting of  individual trials and variables included according to a predefined coding scheme.  Variables to be included are descriptive of characteristics of the study, treatment,  comparison, participant characteristics, and outcomes at all follow-up periods. A  one-stage approach with a mixed model technique based on the intention-to-treat  principle will be used for the analysis. Subsequent analyses will focus on treatment  effect moderators and mediators. DISCUSSION: We will analyze IPD for LBP trials in  which SMT is one of the interventions. IPD meta-analysis has been shown to be more  reliable and valid than aggregate data meta-analysis, although this difference might  also be attributed to the number of studies that can be used or the amount of data  that can be utilized. Therefore, this project may identify important gaps in our  knowledge with respect to prognostic factors of treatment effects.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost effectiveness of insulin  degludec plus liraglutide (IDegLira, Xultophy(®)) compared with six potential  intensification treatment options for patients with T2DM that is uncontrolled with  basal insulin. METHODS: The Swedish Institute for Health Economics (IHE) Cohort  Model of Type 2 Diabetes was used with Swedish input data, a 40-year time frame and  a societal perspective. The comparators for treatment intensification included  insulin glargine, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, insulin aspart plus  either glargine or NPH, and liraglutide plus either glargine or NPH. Clinical data  for all comparators (except NPH insulin) were based on an indirect treatment  comparison of several studies. Prices were obtained from the 2014 Swedish Dental and  Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (Tandvårds- och läkemedelsförmånsverket [TLV])  database, and utility values were obtained from published studies.

IDegLira compared with intensified basal insulin showed an ICER of SEK  28,000 per QALY versus insulin glargine, SEK70,000 per QALY versus NPH insulin and  SEK 60,000 per QALY versus NPH insulin plus liraglutide. IDegLira was dominant over  insulin glargine plus liraglutide and insulin aspart plus insulin glargine or NPH  insulin. Results were driven by the difference in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c))  reduction between treatments, as confirmed by sensitivity analyses.

Until recently, few effective treatment  options existed, and even with the advent of new agents, studies evaluating  comparative efficacy are scarce. In the Ibrutinib Versus Ofatumumab in Patients With  Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE) Phase III study,  ibrutinib, an oral, once-a-day, first-in-class covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase  inhibitor, improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)  compared with ofatumumab (PFS hazard ratio [HR] = 0.106 and OS HR = 0.369 [adjusted  for crossover] at a median of 16 months' follow-up). We sought to establish the  relative efficacy of ibrutinib versus other treatment options for patients with R/R  CLL using indirect comparison methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was  conducted to identify clinical trials sharing a common treatment arm with the  RESONATE Phase III trial such that a network meta-analysis or indirect treatment  comparisons (ITCs) could be conducted. Two trials were identified, each using the  same comparator (ofatumumab) as the RESONATE study. Two pairwise ITCs were conducted  using the Bucher method to establish the relative treatment efficacy of ibrutinib  versus (1) idelalisib plus ofatumumab in the first study and (2) physician's choice,  defined as a mix of therapies commonly used in R/R CLL, in the second study. Odds  ratios for these ITCs were calculated for overall response rate (ORR) and HRs for  PFS and OS. FINDINGS: A strong and consistent trend of superiority for ibrutinib was  observed via these ITC models with idelalisib plus ofatumumab and physician's choice  for ORR, PFS, and OS. Ibrutinib revealed prolonged PFS and OS versus comparators  (PFS HR = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.11; and OS HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.54), physician's  choice (PFS HR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25-0.66; and OS HR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.23-1.08), and  idelalisib plus ofatumumab. These findings were robust and continued to favor  ibrutinib when adjusting (where appropriate) for underlying differences in patient  population between the trials. Some trial differences were not accounted for in the  models and thus some limitations remain; however, consistency of results supports  the overall findings. IMPLICATIONS: In a randomized Phase III study, ibrutinib  significantly improved ORR, PFS, and OS in patients with R/R CLL versus ofatumumab.  In ITC models that used ofatumumab as the common comparator, ibrutinib appears to  have higher ORR and longer PFS and OS versus both idelalisib plus ofatumumab and  physician's choice. In the absence of head-to-head studies and taking into  consideration inherent limitations of ITCs, these models provide useful estimates of  comparative efficacy.","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

The introduction of BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations has yielded significant  increases in PFS and OS for melanoma. However, at present, no direct comparisons  between different BRAF/MEK combinations have been conducted. In light of this, an  indirect treatment comparison was performed between two BRAF/MEK inhibitor  combination therapies for metastatic melanoma, dabrafenib plus trametinib and  vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, in order to understand the relative efficacy and  toxicity profiles of these therapies. METHODS: A systematic literature search  identified two randomized trials as suitable for indirect comparison: the coBRIM  trial of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib versus vemurafenib and the COMBI-v trial of  dabrafenib plus trametinib versus vemurafenib. The comparison followed the method of  Bucher et al. and analyzed both efficacy (overall survival [OS], progression-free  survival [PFS], and overall response rate [ORR]) and safety outcomes (adverse events  [AEs]). RESULTS: The indirect comparison revealed similar efficacy outcomes between  both therapies, with no statistically significant difference between therapies for  OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 - 1.30), PFS (HR 1.05,  95% CI 0.79 - 1.40), or ORR (risk ratio [RR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 - 1.10). Dabrafenib  plus trametinib differed significantly from vemurafenib plus cobimetinib with regard  to the incidence of treatment-related AE (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 - 0.97), any AE grade  ≥3 (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 - 0.85) or dose interruption/modification (RR 0.77, 95% CI  0.60 - 0.99). Several categories of AEs occurred significantly more frequently with  vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, while some occurred significantly more frequently with  dabrafenib plus trametinib. For severe AEs (grade 3 or above), four occurred  significantly more frequently with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib and no severe AE  occurred significantly more frequently with dabrafenib plus trametinib. CONCLUSIONS:  This indirect treatment comparison suggested that dabrafenib plus trametinib had  comparable efficacy to vemurafenib plus cobimetinib but was associated with reduced  adverse events.",NA,"Daud, Adil Gill, Japinder Kamra, Sheily Chen, Lei Ahuja, Amit",Daud A Gill J Kamra S Chen L Ahuja A,NA,"Medicine and Dermatology, University of California, 1600 Divisadero Street Rm A 743,  San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.

It is important to compare therapies to guide the treatment decision-making  process, and establishing the relationship between older agents can strengthen the  networks of evidence for newer therapies. We report the outcome of an indirect  comparison of GM-CSF, dacarbazine, and gp100 in metastatic melanoma through  meta-analysis of absolute treatment effect. METHODS: A systematic literature review  identified trials for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A valid network meta-analysis  was not feasible: treatment-specific meta-analysis was conducted. A published  algorithm was used to adjust overall survival estimates from trials of GM-CSF,  dacarbazine, and gp100 for heterogeneity in baseline prognostic factors. Survival  estimates were compared in three patient groups: stage IIIB-IV M1c,  stage IIIB-IV M1a, and stage IV M1b/c. RESULTS: One trial of GM-CSF, four of  dacarbazine, and one of gp100 were included in the analysis. After adjusting for  differences in baseline prognostic factors, median overall survival (OS) in all  patient groups was longer for those receiving GM-CSF than for those receiving  dacarbazine or gp100. The observed survival over time for GM-CSF was similar to the  adjusted survival for dacarbazine and greater than for gp100 in all patient groups.  CONCLUSION: The relative treatment effect of GM-CSF, dacarbazine, and gp100 has been  reliably estimated by adjusting for differences in baseline prognostic factors.  Results suggest that OS with GM-CSF is at least as good as with dacarbazine and  greater than with gp100. Given the role of these agents as controls in phase 3  trials of new immunotherapies and targeted agents, these results can be used to  contextualize the efficacy of newer therapies.

We introduce a new proof-of-concept strategy to a VLU clinical evidence  network, propensity score matching and sensitivity analysis to predict the  feasibility of the new acellular synthetic matrix plus SC for success in future  randomised, controlled clinical trials. Prospective data on chronic VLUs from a  safety and effectiveness study on an acellular synthetic matrix conducted in one  wound centre in the UK (17 patients) and three wound centres in Australia (36  patients) were compared retrospectively to propensity score-matched data from  patients with comparable leg ulcer disease aetiology, age, baseline ulcer area,  ulcer duration, multi-layer compression bandaging and majority of care completed in  specialist wound centres (average of 1 visit per week), with the outcome measures at  comparable follow-up periods from patients enrolled in four prospective,  multicentre, pragmatic, randomised studies of venous ulcers in the UK (the  comparison group; VLU evidence network).

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE,  and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through April 2016. Eligible  studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity-score matched (PSM)  studies. We performed a DC-MA-[A] of SL-AVR versus TAVI, a DC-MA-[B] of SL-AVR  versus conventional AVR (C-AVR), and a DC-MA-[C] TAVI versus C-AVR. Then, we  computed a IDC-MA-[A'] of TAVI versus SL-AVR from the results of the DC-MA-[B] and  the DC-MA-[C]. RESULTS: We identified 6 RCTs and 30 PSM studies enrolling a total of  15,887 patients. The 3 DC-MAs demonstrated significantly lower perioperative (30-day  or in-hospital) all-cause mortality after SL-AVR than after TAVI (odds ratio [OR],  0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28 to 0.80; p=0.005) and no significant  differences between SL-AVR and C-AVR (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.94; p=0.81) and  between TAVI and C-AVR (1.07; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.27; p=0.45). The computed  IDC-MA-[A'] indicated no significant difference in mortality between SL-AVR and TAVI  (1.01; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.86). Combining the results of the DC-MA-[A] and IDC-MA [A']  showed significantly lower mortality after SL-AVR than after TAVI (OR, 0.65; 95% CI,  0.44 to 0.97; p=0.03).

METHODS: The Cardiff Diabetes Model, an economic model designed to  evaluate the cost-effectiveness of comparator therapies in diabetes was used to  simulate disease progression and estimate the long-term effect of treatments on  patients. Systematic literature reviews, hospital surveys, meta-analysis and  indirect treatment comparison were conducted to obtain model-required patient  profiles, clinical data and costs. Health insurance costs (2015¥) were estimated  over 40 years from a healthcare payer perspective. Univariate and probabilistic  sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The model predicted that dapagliflozin  had lower incidences of cardiovascular events, hypoglycemia and mortality events,  was associated with a mean incremental benefit of 0.25 quality-adjusted life-years  (QALYs) and with a lower cost of ¥8,439 compared with acarbose. This resulted in a  cost saving of ¥33,786 per QALY gained with dapagliflozin. Sensitivity analyses  determined that the results are robust. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin is dominant  compared with acarbose as monotherapy for Chinese T2DM patients, with a little QALY  gain and lower costs. Dapagliflozin offers a well-tolerated and cost-effective  alternative medication for treatment-naive patients in China, and may have a direct  impact in reducing the disease burden of T2DM.",NA,"Gu, Shuyan Mu, Yiming Zhai, Suodi Zeng, Yuhang Zhen, Xuemei Dong, Hengjin",Gu S Mu Y Zhai S Zeng Y Zhen X Dong H,NA,"Center for Health Policy Studies, School of Public Health, Zhejiang University  School of Medicine, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang, China.

Areas covered: We performed a systematic review of medical  databases to collect all eligible clinical trials referring to the topic of our  analysis. Due to the lack of direct clinical trials comparing the drugs we used an  adjusted indirect comparison of efficacy and safety of tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (TKIs) by Bucher method. Expert commentary: Lenvatinib and sorafenib are drugs with  strong evidence on efficacy in treatment of RR-DTC. Based on the currently available  clinical data lenvatinib occurred more efficacious then sorafenib in RR-DTC therapy.  Safety profile of the drugs was acceptable and comparative.

Both drugs enhance slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium  channels. To date no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has directly compared ESL  with LCM as add-on treatments for focal epilepsy. Our aim was to indirectly compare  the efficacy of ESL and LCM used as add-on treatments in patients with focal  epilepsy using common reference-based indirect comparison meta-analysis. METHODS: We  systematically searched RCTs in which ESL or LCM has been used as add-on treatment  in patients with focal epilepsy and compared with placebo. Following outcomes were  considered: ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency; seizure freedom; treatment  withdrawal for any reason; ≥25% increase in seizure frequency. Random-effects  Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses were performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for the  efficacy of ESL or LCM versus placebo. Adjusted indirect comparisons were then made  between ESL and LCM using the obtained results, and comparing the minimum and the  highest effective recommended daily dose of each drug. RESULTS: Eight studies were  included. Indirect comparisons adjusted for dose-effect showed no difference between  ESL and LCM for responder rate, seizure freedom, and withdrawal rates. We could not  assess increase in seizure frequency due to lack of data. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect  comparisons failed to find a significant difference in efficacy between add-on ESL  and LCM in patients with focal epilepsy. Direct head-to-head clinical trials  comparing ESL with LCM as add-on antiepileptic treatment are required to confirm  these results.",Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluates  the cost-effectiveness per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of GClb  compared to RClb, Clb, and ofatumumab plus chlorambucil (OClb) in The Netherlands.  METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of GClb,  RClb, Clb and other treatments in the United Kingdom. A country adaptation was made  to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these therapies in The Netherlands using Dutch  unit costs and Dutch data sources for background mortality and post-progression  survival. RESULTS: An incremental gain of 1.06 and 0.64 QALYs was estimated for GClb  compared to Clb and RClb respectively, at additional costs of €23,208 and €7254 per  patient. Corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were €21,823  and €11,344 per QALY. Indirect treatment comparisons showed an incremental gain  varying from 0.44 to 0.77 QALYs for GClb compared to OClb and additional costs  varying from €7041 to €5028 per patient. The ICER varied from €6556 to €16,180 per  QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the results.

Occasionally the efficacy of a  treatment is assessed without a randomised comparator group (either active or  placebo). OBJECTIVE: To identify and develop a taxonomic account of economic  modelling approaches for pharmaceuticals licensed without RCT data. METHODS: We  searched PubMed, the websites of UK health technology assessment bodies and the  International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Scientific  Presentations Database for assessments of treatments granted a marketing  authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency  from January 1999 to May 2014 without RCT data (74 indications). The outcome of  interest was the approach to modelling efficacy data. RESULTS: Fifty-one unique  models were identified in 29 peer-reviewed articles, 30 health technology  appraisals, and 15 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  abstracts concerning 30 indications (44 indications had not been modelled). We noted  the high rate of non-submission to health technology assessment agencies (28/98).  The majority of models (43/51) were based on 'historical controls'-comparisons to  previous meta-analysis or pooling of trials (5), individual trials (16),  registries/case series (15), or expert opinion (7). Other approaches used the  patient as their own control, performed threshold analysis, assumed time on  treatment was added to overall survival, or performed cost-minimisation analysis.  CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in the quality and approach of models  constructed for drugs granted a marketing authorisation without a RCT. The most  common approach is of a naive comparison to historical data (using other  trials/registry data as a control group), which has considerable scope for bias.",NA,"Hatswell, Anthony J Freemantle, Nick Baio, Gianluca",Hatswell AJ Freemantle N Baio G,NA,"Department of Statistical Science, University College London, Gower Street, London,  WC1E 6BT, UK. ahatswell@bresmed.com.

METHODS: Random-effects Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses  to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for efficacy and safety of LEV versus VPA and LEV or VPA  versus PHT were used. Adjusted indirect comparisons between LEV and VPA were used.  RESULTS: Two RCTs comparing LEV with PHT (144 episodes of SE) and 3 RCTs comparing  VPA with PHT (227 episodes of SE) were included. Direct comparisons showed no  difference in clinical seizure cessation, neither between VPA and PHT (OR: 1.07; 95%  CI: 0.57 to 2.03) nor between LEV and PHT (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.50 to 2.79). Indirect  comparisons showed no difference between LEV and VPA for clinical seizure cessation  (OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.45 to 2.97). Results of indirect comparisons are consistent  with results of a recent RCT directly comparing LEV with VPA. CONCLUSION: The  absence of a statistically significant difference in direct and indirect comparisons  is due to the lack of sufficient statistical power to detect a difference.  Conducting a RCT that has not enough people to detect a clinically important  difference or to estimate an effect with sufficient precision can be regarded a  waste of time and resources and may raise several ethical concerns, especially in  RCT on SE.",Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In phase 3 trials, DMF (DEFINE/CONFIRM) and  fingolimod (FREEDOMS/FREEDOMS II) resulted in significant reductions in clinical and  magnetic resonance imaging activity, with acceptable safety profiles. Direct  comparisons of these treatments are not possible due to a lack of head-to-head  trials. We compared 2 year efficacy of DMF versus fingolimod at the approved dosage  using a matching-adjusted indirect approach. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individual  patient data from DEFINE and CONFIRM, and aggregate data from FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS  II, were pooled and compared using the matching-adjusted in-direct method. To  account for cross-trial differences, data from trials with available individual  patient data were adjusted to match aggregate data (i.e. average patient  characteristics) from trials without patient-level data. Data from DMF-treated  patients were weighted such that average baseline characteristics matched those of  fingolimod-treated patients. After matching, weighted treatment outcomes for  DMF-treated patients (240 mg twice daily) were compared with summary outcomes for  fingolimod-treated patients (0.5 mg once daily). All comparison results of DMF  versus fingolimod used fingolimod as the reference. RESULTS: After matching,  baseline characteristics were balanced between DMF and fingolimod. At year 2, the  efficacy of DMF was similar to that of fingolimod for annualized relapse rate (rate  ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.11 [0.88, 1.40]), 12 week confirmed  disability progression (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.90 [0.63, 1.29]), and Multiple  Sclerosis Functional Composite (mean difference [95% CI]: 0.04 [-0.05, 0.13]). For  patient-reported outcomes (EuroQoL 5-Dimensions questionnaire), the mean differences  (95% CI) were 0.05 (0.01, 0.08) for utility score and 3.22 (0.58, 5.86) for visual  analog scale score, significantly favoring DMF. There was no significant difference  in the percentage of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) for DMF  versus fingolimod among matching-adjusted patients with complete NEDA data: rate  ratio (95% CI): 0.92 (0.51, 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: Using the matching-adjusted indirect  comparison approach, the efficacy of DMF and fingolimod were similar on all clinical  outcomes, while patient-reported outcomes showed greater benefit with DMF. Study  limitations include possible confounding from unobserved/unknown differences between  trials, and trial length may have been insufficient to detect significant  differences on disability progression.

There are well-established advantages to using individual patient  data to perform network meta-analysis and methods for network meta-analysis of  individual patient data have already been developed for dichotomous and  time-to-event data. This paper describes appropriate methods for the network  meta-analysis of individual patient data on continuous outcomes. METHODS: This paper  introduces and describes network meta-analysis of individual patient data models for  continuous outcomes using the analysis of covariance framework. Comparisons are made  between this approach and change score and final score only approaches, which are  frequently used and have been proposed in the methodological literature. A  motivating example on the effectiveness of acupuncture for chronic pain is used to  demonstrate the methods. Individual patient data on 28 randomised controlled trials  were synthesised. Consistency of endpoints across the evidence base was obtained  through standardisation and mapping exercises. RESULTS: Individual patient data  availability avoided the use of non-baseline-adjusted models, allowing instead for  analysis of covariance models to be applied and thus improving the precision of  treatment effect estimates while adjusting for baseline imbalance. CONCLUSIONS: The  network meta-analysis of individual patient data using the analysis of covariance  approach is advocated to be the most appropriate modelling approach for network  meta-analysis of continuous outcomes, particularly in the presence of baseline  imbalance. Further methods developments are required to address the challenge of  analysing aggregate level data in the presence of baseline imbalance.",NA,"Saramago, Pedro Woods, Beth Weatherly, Helen Manca, Andrea Sculpher, Mark Khan, Kamran Vickers, Andrew J MacPherson, Hugh",Saramago P Woods B Weatherly H Manca A Sculpher M Khan K Vickers AJ MacPherson H,ORCID: 0000-0001-9063-8590,"Centre for Health Economics, University of York, York, UK.  pedro.saramago@york.ac.uk.

To date, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has directly compared  BRV with ESL, LCM, or PER. PURPOSE: To compare BRV with the other add-on AEDs in  patients with uncontrolled focal epilepsy, estimating their efficacy and  tolerability through an adjusted, common-reference based indirect comparison  meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched RCTs in which add-on treatment  with ESL or LCM in patients with focal onset seizures have been compared with  placebo. Efficacy and tolerability outcomes were considered. Random-effects  Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses were performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for the  efficacy of BRV, LCM, ESL, or PER versus placebo. Adjusted indirect comparisons were  then made between BRV and the other three AEDs using the obtained results, comparing  the minimum and the highest effective recommended daily dose of each drug. RESULTS:  Seventeen RCTs, with a total of 4971 patients were included. After adjusting for  dose-effects, indirect comparisons showed no difference between BRV and LCM, ESL, or  PER for responder rate and seizure freedom. Lower adverse events were observed with  high dose BRV compared to high dose ESL or PER, but no difference was found in  withdrawing because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons do not  demonstrate a significant difference in efficacy between add-on BRV and LCM, ESL, or  PER in focal epilepsy, and might suggest a better tolerability of BRV than ESL, and  possibly also PER, at the highest effective recommended dose.",Copyright © 2016 British Epilepsy Association.

Generic medicines  are approved by regulatory authorities based on the demonstration of bioequivalence  with the innovator or reference product, as well as meeting quality standards. In  clinical practice, however, it is not unusual for generics to be interchanged  between each other. This study investigated the differences in bioavailability  between WHO-prequalified first-line antiretroviral generics by means of adjusted  indirect comparisons to ensure interchangeability between these generics. METHODS:  Data on 34 products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate,  lamivudine and efavirenz in single formulations or fixed-dose combinations were  included in the analysis. The 90% CI for the adjusted indirect comparisons was  calculated using the homoscedastic method that uses the conventional t-test, and  assumes homogeneity of variances between the studies and small sample sizes. The  combined standard deviation of both bioequivalence studies was calculated from the  variability of each individual study. RESULTS: The adjusted indirect comparisons  between generics showed that the differences, expressed as 90% CIs, are less than  30%. Confidence in the interchangeability of two generic products was reduced if the  mean difference between the test and reference in the original studies is more than  10%. CONCLUSIONS: From a bioequivalence perspective, the generic antiretroviral  medicines prequalified by WHO are interchangeable with the reference, as well as  between each other without safety or efficacy concerns.",NA,"Gwaza, Luther Gordon, John Welink, Jan Potthast, Henrike Leufkens, Hubert Stahl, Matthias García-Arieta, Alfredo",Gwaza L Gordon J Welink J Potthast H Leufkens H Stahl M García-Arieta A,NA,"Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Utrecht, the Netherlands.

To address this issue, matching-adjusted  indirect comparison (MAIC) measures treatment efficacy after weighting individual  patient data to match patient characteristics across trials. To date, however, there  is no consensus on how best to implement MAIC. To address this issue, we applied  MAIC to measure how two attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatments  (guanfacine extended release and atomoxetine hydrochloride) affect patients' ADHD  symptoms, as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale IV score. We tested MAIC sensitivity  to: matched patient characteristics, matched statistical moments, weighting matrix,  and placebo-arm matching (i.e., matching on outcomes in the placebo arm). After  applying MAIC, guanfacine and atomoxetine had similar reductions in ADHD symptoms  (Δ: 0.4, p < 0.737). The results were similar for three of four sensitivity  analyses. When we applied MAIC with placebo-arm matching, however, guanfacine  reduced symptoms more than atomoxetine (Δ: -3.9, p < 0.004). We discuss the  implication of this finding and advise MAIC practitioners to carefully consider the  use of placebo-arm matching, depending on the presence of residual confounding  across trials.

METHODS: A Markov cohort model in which  patients were administered a sequence of treatments was used to predict long-term  outcomes associated with each treatment. The model was informed by data from the  eltrombopag clinical trial program and the available literature. The analysis was  conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, and a lifetime  time horizon was used. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were  performed. RESULTS: Eltrombopag dominated romiplostim (i.e., eltrombopag was as  effective as but less costly than romiplostim) in both splenectomized and  nonsplenectomized patients, assuming a class effect for the two treatments.  Eltrombopag also dominated romiplostim in most deterministic sensitivity analyses  with the exception of when indirect efficacy estimates were incorporated into the  model. In this analysis, eltrombopag no longer dominated romiplostim but remained  cost-effective versus romiplostim at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per  quality-adjusted life-year. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that  there was a 99% and 92% chance of eltrombopag being cost-effective at a  cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in  splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results of  this study demonstrate that eltrombopag is cost-effective when compared with  romiplostim to be used in the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia,  representing good value for the UK National Health Service.",Copyright © 2016 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  (ISPOR).

METHODS: Studies  comparing conventional (c)TACE versus (90)Y-radioembolization or DEB-TACE for HCC  treatment were identified using PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The  adjusted indirect meta-analytic method for effectiveness comparison of DEB-TACE  versus (90)Y-radioembolization was used. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare  baseline characteristics. A priori defined sensitivity analysis of stratified study  subgroups was performed for primary outcome analyses. Publication bias was tested by  Egger's and Begg's tests. RESULTS: Fourteen studies comparing DEB-TACE or  (90)Y-radioembolization with cTACE were included. Analysis revealed a 1-year overall  survival benefit for DEB-TACE over (90)Y-radioembolization (79 % vs. 54.8 %; OR:  0.57; 95 %CI: 0.355-0.915; p = 0.02; I-squared: 0 %; p > 0.5), but not for the  2-year (61 % vs. 34 %; OR: 0.65; 95%CI: 0.294-1.437; p = 0.29) and 3-year survival  (56.4 % vs. 20.9 %; OR: 0.713; 95 % CI: 0.21-2.548; p = 0.62). There was significant  heterogeneity in the 2- and 3-year survival analyses. The pooled median overall  survival was longer for DEB-TACE (22.6 vs. 14.7 months). There was no significant  difference in tumour response rate. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE and (90)Y-radioembolization  are efficacious treatments for patients suffering from HCC; DEB-TACE demonstrated  survival benefit at 1-year compared to (90)Y-radioembolization but direct comparison  is warranted for further evaluation. KEY POINTS: • This meta-analysis shows greater  1-year survival benefit for DEB-TACE over (90) Y-radioembolization. • DEB-TACE has a  favourable 2- & 3-year survival benefit trend over (90) Y-radioembolization. • No  significant difference for tumour response was detected. • Direct comparison of  these methods for a more robust evaluation is warranted.",NA,"Ludwig, Johannes M Zhang, Di Xing, Minzhi Kim, Hyun S",Ludwig JM Zhang D Xing M Kim HS,NA,"Division of Interventional Radiology, Department of Radiology and Biomedical  Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, 330 Cedar Street, TE 2-224, New Haven, CT, 06510,  USA.

Recently, panobinostat plus  bortezomib and DEX (PAN + BTZ + DEX) was licensed in this setting. The current study  assessed the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes with  PAN + BTZ + DEX versus LEN + DEX (primary comparator) and POM + DEX (exploratory  comparator). METHODS: Since an anchor-based indirect treatment comparison was not  feasible, the matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison approach was used. To  compare the survival outcomes, patient-level data were generated for the comparators  utilizing published Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. The use of approximated  patient-level data and matched data for PAN + BTZ + DEX allowed the use of Cox  proportional hazards models and the assessment of the proportional hazards  assumption. In cases where there was evidence that the proportional hazards  assumption was violated, time-dependent hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated. Median  and mean values for PFS and OS were predicted. RESULTS: For both PFS and OS, the  proportional hazards assumption was not satisfied, therefore time-dependent HRs were  estimated. Using time-dependent HRs, the mean PFS was estimated to be 11.83 months  for PAN + BTZ + DEX and 10.96 months for LEN + DEX. The corresponding mean OS  estimates were 30.73 and 27.76 months, respectively. Comparisons with POM + DEX were  affected by large uncertainty and did not allow making robust inferences.  CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study that combined  matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison with time-dependent HRs to address  changing patterns in the HR. The results suggest that treatment with PAN + BTZ + DEX  and LEN + DEX are associated with similar mean PFS and OS in the third-line  treatment setting of multiple myeloma.",NA,"Majer, Istvan van de Wetering, Gijs Polanyi, Zoltan Krishna, Arun Gray, Elisabeth Roy, Anuja",Majer I van de Wetering G Polanyi Z Krishna A Gray E Roy A,NA,"Pharmerit International, Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Marten Meesweg 107,  3068 AV, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

In this third of three reviews, we examine the  applications that have been used in the literature to predict real-world  effectiveness from randomized controlled trial efficacy data. We searched MEDLINE,  EMBASE from inception to March 2014, the Cochrane Methodology Register, and websites  of key journals and organisations and reference lists. We extracted data on the type  of model and predictions, data sources, validation and sensitivity analyses, disease  area and software. We identified 12 articles in which four approaches were used:  multi-state models, discrete event simulation models, physiology-based models and  survival and generalized linear models. Studies predicted outcomes over longer time  periods in different patient populations, including patients with lower levels of  adherence or persistence to treatment or examined doses not tested in trials. Eight  studies included individual patient data. Seven examined cardiovascular and  metabolic diseases and three neurological conditions. Most studies included  sensitivity analyses, but external validation was performed in only three studies.  We conclude that mathematical modelling to predict real-world effectiveness of drug  interventions is not widely used at present and not well validated. © 2016 The  Authors Research Synthesis Methods Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",© 2016 The Authors Research Synthesis Methods Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"Panayidou, Klea Gsteiger, Sandro Egger, Matthias Kilcher, Gablu Carreras, Máximo Efthimiou, Orestis Debray, Thomas P A Trelle, Sven Hummel, Noemi",Panayidou K Gsteiger S Egger M Kilcher G Carreras M Efthimiou O Debray TP Trelle S Hummel N,NA,"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern,  Switzerland.

Most NMAs are  based on published aggregate data (AD) and have limited possibilities for  investigating the extent of network consistency and between-study heterogeneity.  Given that individual participant data (IPD) are considered the gold standard in  evidence synthesis, we explored statistical methods for IPD-NMA and investigated  their potential advantages and limitations, compared with AD-NMA. We discuss several  one-stage random-effects NMA models that account for within-trial imbalances,  treatment effect modifiers, missing response data and longitudinal responses. We  illustrate all models in a case study of 18 antidepressant trials with a continuous  endpoint (the Hamilton Depression Score). All trials suffered from drop-out;  missingness of longitudinal responses ranged from 21 to 41% after 6 weeks follow-up.  Our results indicate that NMA based on IPD may lead to increased precision of  estimated treatment effects. Furthermore, it can help to improve network consistency  and explain between-study heterogeneity by adjusting for participant-level effect  modifiers and adopting more advanced models for dealing with missing response data.  We conclude that implementation of IPD-NMA should be considered when trials are  affected by substantial drop-out rate, and when treatment effects are potentially  influenced by participant-level covariates.",NA,"Debray, Thomas Pa Schuit, Ewoud Efthimiou, Orestis Reitsma, Johannes B Ioannidis, John Pa Salanti, Georgia Moons, Karel Gm",Debray TP Schuit E Efthimiou O Reitsma JB Ioannidis JP Salanti G Moons KG,NA,"1 Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center  Utrecht, The Netherlands. 2 Cochrane Netherlands, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands. 1 Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center  Utrecht, The Netherlands. 2 Cochrane Netherlands, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands. 3 Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford, Stanford University, USA. 4 Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland. 5 Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, University of Ioannina School of Medicine,  Greece. 1 Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center  Utrecht, The Netherlands. 2 Cochrane Netherlands, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands. 3 Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford, Stanford University, USA. 4 Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland. 5 Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, University of Ioannina School of Medicine,  Greece. 6 Institute of Primary Health Care, University of Bern, Switzerland. 1 Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center  Utrecht, The Netherlands. 2 Cochrane Netherlands, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands. 4 Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland.",eng,NA,"Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20160811,England,Stat Methods Med Res,Statistical methods in medical research,9212457,IM,NOTNLM,*Meta-analysis *individual participant data *missing data *mixed treatment comparison *network meta-analysis *repeated measurements,2016/08/05 06:00,2019/11/02 06:00,2016/08/05 06:00,2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed] 2019/11/02 06:00 [medline] 2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez],0962280216660741 [pii] 10.1177/0962280216660741 [doi],ppublish,Stat Methods Med Res. 2018 May;27(5):1351-1364. doi: 10.1177/0962280216660741.

537,27583319,NA,Publisher,NA,NA,2016 Aug,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: Complex wounds are those that heal by secondary intention and include  lower-limb ulcers, pressure ulcers and some surgical wounds. The care of people with  complex wounds is costly, with care mainly being delivered by community nurses.  There is a lack of current, high-quality data regarding the numbers and types of  people affected, care received and outcomes achieved. OBJECTIVES: To (1) assess how  high-quality data about complex wounds can be captured effectively for use in both  service planning and research while ensuring integration with current clinical data  collection systems and minimal impact on staff time; (2) investigate whether or not  a clinical register of people with complex wounds could give valid estimates of  treatment effects, thus reducing dependence on large-scale randomised controlled  trials (RCTs); (3) identify the most important research questions and outcomes for  people with complex wounds from the perspectives of patients, carers and health-care  professionals; (4) evaluate the potential contributions to decision-making of  individual patient data meta-analysis and mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis;  and (5) complete and update systematic reviews in topic areas of high priority.  METHODS: To meet objectives 1 and 2 we conducted a prevalence survey and developed  and piloted a longitudinal disease register. A consultative, deliberative method and  in-depth interviews were undertaken to address objective 3. To address objectives 4  and 5 we conducted systematic reviews including mixed treatment comparison  meta-analysis. RESULTS: From the prevalence survey we estimated the point prevalence  of all complex wounds to be 1.47 per 1000 people (95% confidence interval 1.38 to  1.56 per 1000 people). Pressure ulcers and venous leg ulcers were the most common  type of complex wound. A total of 195 people with a complex wound were recruited to  a complex wounds register pilot. We established the feasibility of correctly  identifying, extracting and transferring routine NHS data into the register;  however, participant recruitment, data collection and tracking individual wounds in  people with multiple wounds were challenging. Most patients and health professionals  regarded healing of the wound as the primary treatment goal. Patients were greatly  troubled by the social consequences of having a complex wound. Complex wounds are  frequently a consequence of, and are themselves, a long-term condition but treatment  is usually focused on healing the wound. Consultative, deliberative research agenda  setting on pressure ulcer prevention and treatment with patients, carers and  clinicians yielded 960 treatment uncertainties and a top 12 list of research  priorities. Of 167 RCTs of complex wound treatments in a systematic review of study  quality, 41% did not specify a primary outcome and the overall quality of the  conduct and reporting of the research was poor. Mixed-treatment comparison  meta-analysis in areas of high priority identified that matrix hydrocolloid  dressings had the highest probability (70%) of being the most effective dressing for  diabetic foot ulcers, whereas a hyaluronan fleece dressing had the highest  probability (35%) of being the most effective dressing for venous ulcers; however,  the quality of this evidence was low and uncertainty is high. CONCLUSIONS: Complex  wounds are common and costly with a poor evidence base for many frequent clinical  decisions. There is little routine clinical data collection in community nursing. A  prospective complex wounds register has the potential to both assist clinical  decision-making and provide important research evidence but would be challenging to  implement without investment in information technology in NHS community services.  Future work should focus on developing insights into typical wound healing  trajectories, identifying factors that are prognostic for healing and assessing the  cost-effectiveness of selected wound treatments.

This was a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC)  study of efficacy of BAY 81-8973 with antihemophilic factor (recombinant)  plasma/albumin-free method (rAHF-PFM) and turoctocog alfa for the prophylaxis of  severe hemophilia A. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to  identify trials of rAHF-PFM and turoctocog alfa. Comparisons were conducted using  BAY 81-8973 individual patient data (IPD) from LEOPOLD trials and published data  from rAHF-PFM and turoctocog alfa trials. Differences in outcome reporting were  reconciled using transformation of BAY 81-8973 IPD. Patients in pooled LEOPOLD  trials were weighted to match baseline characteristics for rAHF-PFM or turoctocog  alfa trials using MAICs. After matching, annualized bleed rates (ABRs) were compared  using weighted t-tests. RESULTS: Two rAHF-PFM trials and one turoctocog alfa trial  were identified. In these trials, rFVIIIs were dosed thrice weekly or every other  day; in LEOPOLD trials, BAY 81-8973 was dosed twice- or thrice weekly. Three MAICs  were conducted because the two rAHF-PFM trials calculated ABRs differently, matching  for age, race, and weight (turoctocog alfa only). BAY 81-8973 had similar ABR of all  bleeds vs rAHF-PFM (two trials: 4.8 vs 6.3, 1.9 vs 1.8 [square root transform]) and  lower ABR of spontaneous bleeds and trauma bleeds (2.6 vs 4.1, 2.1 vs 4.7; both  P<0.05). BAY 81-8973 showed lower ABR of all bleeds and spontaneous bleeds vs  turoctocog alfa (4.3 vs 6.5, 2.8 vs 4.3; both P<0.05) and similar ABR of trauma  bleeds (1.5 vs 1.6). In subgroup analysis, twice-weekly BAY 81-8973 had similar ABRs  of all bleeds, spontaneous bleeds, and trauma bleeds compared to rAHF-PFM and  turoctocog alfa. CONCLUSION: This indirect comparison found that prophylaxis with  BAY 81-8973, even including the lower frequency of two times a week and lower factor  VIII consumption, has efficacy comparable to rAHF-PFM and turoctocog alfa, which  were dosed thrice weekly or every other day.

The result will help assess the relevance of VA gain comparisons across  trials. METHODS: A correlation analysis was performed between mean baseline VA and  VA gain at month 12 for 1,616 diabetic macular edema patients across nine randomized  clinical trials (RESOLVE, RISE, RIDE, RESTORE, RETAIN, DRCR.net Protocol I, DA  VINCI, VIVID, VISTA) with anti-VEGF treatment regimens ranibizumab 0.5 mg and  aflibercept 2 mg. RESULTS: The mean baseline VA ranged from 56.9 to 64.8 Early  Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. The mean VA gain at month 12  ranged from 6.8 to 13.1 ETDRS letters across trials. There was a strong inverse  correlation between mean baseline VA and VA gain at month 12 (r=-0.85). The mean VA  at 12 months plateaued at ~70 (68.5-73.0) ETDRS letters (20/40 Snellen VA  equivalent) for the anti-VEGF treatment groups from all trials, regardless of dosing  regimens and agents.

METHODS: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of GClb versus  other chemoimmunotherapy options. The model comprised three mutually exclusive  health states: ""progression-free survival (with/without therapy)"", ""progression  (refractory/relapsed lines)"", and ""death"". Each state was assigned a health utility  value representing patients' quality of life and a specific cost value. Comparisons  between GClb and rituximab plus chlorambucil or only chlorambucil were performed  using patient-level clinical trial data; other comparisons were performed via a  network meta-analysis using information gathered in a systematic literature review.  To support the model, a utility elicitation study was conducted from the perspective  of the UK National Health Service. RESULTS: There was good agreement between the  model-predicted progression-free and overall survival and that from the CLL11 trial.  On incorporating data from the indirect treatment comparisons, it was found that  GClb was cost-effective with a range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below  a threshold of £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and remained so during  deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses under various scenarios.  CONCLUSIONS: GClb was estimated to increase both quality-adjusted life expectancy  and treatment costs compared with several commonly used therapies, with incremental  cost-effectiveness ratios below commonly referenced UK thresholds.

The Centre for  Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York  were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This  article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the  resulting NICE guidance TA367 issued in November 2015. The ERG critically reviewed  the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas  requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence.  Two phase III randomised controlled trials for a second-line population involving  vortioxetine were identified-REVIVE and TAK318. These two trials represent only 972  of over 7000 patients included in trials of vortioxetine. In REVIVE, there was a  statistically significant difference in depression scores favouring vortioxetine  compared with agomelatine [mean Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  score difference of 2.16 points; 95 % confidence interval 0.81-3.51]. The ERG  concluded that, based on all the evidence, rather than the substantially restricted  subset of evidence originally considered by the manufacturer, vortioxetine is likely  to be similar in efficacy to other analysed antidepressants [citalopram, sertraline,  escitalopram and venlafaxine extended release (XR)], and may be more efficacious  than agomelatine and inferior to duloxetine. The ERG concluded that vortioxetine may  be more tolerable than other analysed antidepressants (sertraline, venlafaxine XR  and bupropion), although the limited data prevent firm conclusions. The base-case  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vortioxetine reported by the  manufacturer was £378 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with  venlafaxine. Given considerable concerns about the indirect treatment comparison  undertaken by the manufacturer, the use of only a restrictive subset of the  available evidence, and concerns regarding comparators and structural model  assumptions, the ERG believes that this is not a valid estimate of the cost  effectiveness of vortioxetine. Following corrections made to the model made by the  ERG, the estimated cost effectiveness of vortioxetine was sensitive to the source of  evidence used, in addition to whether certain comparators were excluded. The NICE  thus asked the manufacturer to provide a revised economic model, which incorporated  the broader evidence base and considered the cost effectiveness of vortioxetine as a  third-line treatment. Assuming equal efficacy, vortioxetine was shown to be less  costly and generate a higher QALY gain than relevant comparators at the third-line  of treatment owing to its tolerability and adverse event profile. The NICE Appraisal  Committee recommended vortioxetine as an option for treating MDEs in adults whose  condition has responded inadequately to two antidepressants within the current  episode.",NA,"Lomas, James Llewellyn, Alexis Soares, Marta Simmonds, Mark Wright, Kath Eastwood, Alison Palmer, Stephen",Lomas J Llewellyn A Soares M Simmonds M Wright K Eastwood A Palmer S,NA,"Centre for Health Economics (CHE), University of York, York, YO10 5DD, UK.  james.lomas@york.ac.uk.

No randomized trial has compared these treatments head-to-head. We compared  efficacy outcomes between patients receiving ceritinib and an external control group  receiving crizotinib, both as initial ALK-targeted therapies for previously treated  advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC. METHODS: Individual patient data for the  ceritinib-treated patients were drawn from two single-arm trials (ASCEND-1 and  ASCEND-3); published summary data for the crizotinib-treated patients were extracted  from three trials (PROFILE 1001, PROFILE 1005, and PROFILE 1007). To adjust for  cross-trial differences, average baseline characteristics were matched using  propensity score weighting. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS),  and overall response rate were then compared between treatment groups. RESULTS:  Before matching, the ceritinib-treated patients (n = 189) were significantly  different from the crizotinib-treated patients (n = 557) in the distribution of race  and number of prior regimens. After matching, all available baseline characteristics  were balanced. Compared with crizotinib, ceritinib was associated with longer OS  (hazard ratio = 0.59, 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.75) and longer PFS  (median 13.8 versus 8.3 months, hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% confidence interval:  0.44-0.62) in Cox proportional hazards models. The 12-month OS was 82.6% with  ceritinib and 66.0% with crizotinib in a Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank p < 0.001).  There was no significant difference in overall response rate between ceritinib and  crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: In an adjusted comparison across separate clinical trials,  ceritinib was associated with prolonged OS and PFS compared with crizotinib when  used as initial ALK-targeted therapy for previously treated ALK-positive NSCLC.",Copyright © 2016 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

The Centre for Reviews  and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were  commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article  presents the ERG's critical review of the evidence presented in the company  submission in the context of a description of the company submission, and the  resulting NICE guidance. The main clinical effectiveness data for daclatasvir in  combination with sofosbuvir (daclatasvir + sofosbuvir) were derived from two  uncontrolled open-label trials. Among patients with genotype 1 infection, 98-100 %  of patients had a sustained virologic response at week 12 (SVR12), overall. Among  genotype 3 patients, between 85 and 100 % had SVR12 across patient populations and  regimens. The main evidence for daclatasvir + pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin  (PR) came from one randomised controlled trial comparing daclatasvir + PR with PR in  patients with genotype 4. This found an SVR12 rate of 82 % in previously untreated  patients. Serious adverse event rates associated with daclatasvir were low. The lack  of comparative trial evidence for daclatasvir + sofosbuvir and many of the  comparators defined in the NICE scope meant that established methods for comparing  interventions either directly via head-to-head trial comparisons or via adjusted  indirect comparisons were not feasible. Comparisons of SVR rates were therefore  largely based on unadjusted estimates drawn from individual trial arms and subgroups  of individual trial arms. The ERG concluded that, despite limited evidence,  daclatasvir in combination with other treatments appeared to be associated with a  high SVR rate. Daclatasvir + sofosbuvir was unlikely to be inferior to comparator  treatments in genotype 1 patients; but, due to limited evidence, the relative  efficacy of daclatasvir and other treatments in genotype 3 and 4 patients or  patients with compensated cirrhosis was uncertain. The economic evaluation compared  daclatasvir + sofosbuvir and daclatasvir + PR with a wide range of NICE-approved  treatments for hepatitis C. The company submission focused on a series of subgroups  defined by disease severity (METAVIR fibrosis stage F3, compensated cirrhosis),  genotype and treatment history. In the cost-effectiveness analysis,  daclatasvir-containing regimens were cost effective at a £20,000-£30,000 per QALY  threshold in the following F3 populations: genotype 1 treatment naïve (Incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = £19,739/QALY) and treatment experienced  (£15,687/QALY) and genotypes 1, 3 and 4 interferon ineligible or intolerant  (£5906-£9607/QALY depending on subgroup). In patients with cirrhosis,  daclatasvir-containing regimens were not cost effective. The ERG found the company's  economic analyses to be highly uncertain and in places biased. However, the ERG  found that daclatasvir-containing regimens were cost effective in certain  populations with significant fibrosis, and following new analyses by the company  after a price reduction, in certain populations with cirrhosis, including patients  who were not eligible for or who were intolerant to interferon therapy. The NICE  Appraisal Committee's preliminary recommendation was that daclatasvir + sofosbuvir  should be available as an option in genotype 1 and 4 patients with significant  fibrosis but without cirrhosis, who had either been treated previously or were  ineligible or intolerant to interferon. In response to the preliminary  recommendation, the manufacturer submitted additional information including  comparator SVR rates and a revised confidential price. Following this, the Committee  expanded its original recommendation in its Final Appraisal Determination. The  recommendation was expanded to include daclatasvir + sofosbuvir as an option for  patients with significant fibrosis but without cirrhosis (in previously untreated  patients with genotype 1, and genotype 3 patients ineligible or intolerant to  interferon) and genotype 1, 3 and 4 cirrhotic patients who were ineligible or  intolerant to interferon. Daclatasvir + PR was also recommended as an option for  genotype 4 patients who had significant fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis.",NA,"Llewellyn, Alexis Faria, Rita Woods, Beth Simmonds, Mark Lomas, James Woolacott, Nerys Griffin, Susan",Llewellyn A Faria R Woods B Simmonds M Lomas J Woolacott N Griffin S,NA,"Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), University of York, York, YO10 5DD, UK.  alexis.llewellyn@york.ac.uk.

We performed a systematic review  and meta-analysis to determine whether biologic agents affect the risk of infection  or malignancy in adults with IBD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus,  Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register, World Health Organization  International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov through  March 2016 for randomized placebo-controlled or head-to-head trials of biologic  agents approved for treatment of adults with IBD (ie, adalimumab, certolizumab,  golimumab, infliximab, natalizumab, or vedolizumab). Two reviewers independently  extracted study data and outcomes (serious infections, opportunistic infections,  tuberculosis, any infection, and malignancies) and rated each trial's risk of bias.  We used conventional meta-analysis to synthesize direct evidence and a network  meta-analysis for adjusted indirect treatment comparisons. RESULTS: We identified 49  randomized placebo-controlled studies comprising 14,590 participants. Synthesis of  the evidence indicated that patients treated with biologics had a moderate increase  in risk of any infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI],  1.10-1.29) and a significant increase in risk of opportunistic infections (OR, 1.90;  95% CI, 1.21-3.01). Risk of serious infections was not increased in patients treated  with biologics (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71-1.12). On the contrary, biologics appeared to  significantly reduce risk of serious infections in studies with low risk of bias  (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.90). We did not find an increased risk of malignancy with  use of biologic agents (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.54-1.50), but data were insufficient in  terms of exposure and follow-up times. None of the indirect comparisons, either  among the individual agents or between the anti-tumor necrosis factor and  anti-integrin classes, reached significance for any of the outcomes analyzed.  CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a systematic review and meta-analysis, biologic agents  increase the risk of opportunistic infections in patients with IBD, but not the risk  of serious infections. It is necessary to continue to monitor the comparative and  long-term safety profiles of these drugs.",Copyright © 2016 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE,  EMBASE, LILACS, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and  ClinicalTrials.gov through June 2015. Randomized controlled trials published in  English that compare SGLT2 inhibitor plus insulin (SGLT2i/INS) with placebo plus  insulin or DPP4 inhibitor plus insulin (DPP4i/INS) with placebo plus insulin in  patients with T2DM were selected. Data on the study characteristics, efficacy and  safety outcomes were extracted. We compared the efficacy and safety between  SGLT2i/INS and DPP4i/INS indirectly with covariates adjustment. Risk of potential  bias was assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen eligible randomized controlled trials  comprising 6980 patients were included (five SGLT2 inhibitor studies and nine DPP4  inhibitor studies). Covariate-adjusted indirect comparison using meta-regression  analyses revealed that SGLT2i/INS achieved greater reduction in HbA(1c) [weighted  mean difference (WMD) -0.24%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.43 to -0.05%], fasting  plasma glucose (WMD -18.0 mg/dL, 95% CI -28.5 to -7.6 mg/dL) and body weight (WMD  -2.38 kg, 95% CI -3.18 to -1.58 kg) from baseline than DPP4i/INS without increasing  the risk of hypoglycaemia (relative risks 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.82). CONCLUSIONS:  Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors achieved better glycaemic control and  greater weight reduction than DPP4 inhibitors without increasing the risk of  hypoglycaemia in patients with T2DM that is inadequately controlled with insulin.  There has been no direct comparison of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors in  patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with insulin therapy. In this study, we  performed indirect meta-analysis comparing SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors  added to insulin therapy. Without increasing hypoglycaemia, SGLT2 inhibitors showed  better glycaemic control and greater weight reduction than DPP4 inhibitors in  patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with insulin. The results of the current  study could serve as the best available evidence in selecting oral agents to improve  glycaemic control in insulin-treated T2DM patients.

Subsequent joint  damage can lead to disability and growth restriction. Treatment commonly includes  disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate. Clinical  practice now favours newer drugs termed biologic DMARDs where indicated. OBJECTIVE:  To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of four biologic DMARDs  [etanercept (Enbrel(®), Pfizer), abatacept (Orencia(®), Bristol-Myers Squibb),  adalimumab (Humira(®), AbbVie) and tocilizumab (RoActemra(®), Roche) - with or  without methotrexate where indicated] for the treatment of JIA (systemic or  oligoarticular JIA are excluded). DATA SOURCES: Electronic bibliographic databases  including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and the Database of Abstracts of  Reviews of Effects were searched for published studies from inception to May 2015  for English-language articles. Bibliographies of related papers, systematic reviews  and company submissions were screened and experts were contacted to identify  additional evidence. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness,  health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness were undertaken in accordance  with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses  statement. A cost-utility decision-analytic model was developed to compare the  estimated cost-effectiveness of biologic DMARDs versus methotrexate. The base-case  time horizon was 30 years and the model took a NHS perspective, with costs and  benefits discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: Four placebo-controlled randomised controlled  trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria for the clinical effectiveness review (one  RCT evaluating each biologic DMARD). Only one RCT included UK participants.  Participants had to achieve an American College of Rheumatology Pediatric (ACR  Pedi)-30 response to open-label lead-in treatment in order to be randomised. An  exploratory adjusted indirect comparison suggests that the four biologic DMARDs are  similar, with fewer disease flares and greater proportions of ACR Pedi-50 and -70  responses among participants randomised to continued biologic DMARDs. However,  confidence intervals were wide, the number of trials was low and there was clinical  heterogeneity between trials. Open-label extensions of the trials showed that,  generally, ACR responses remained constant or even increased after the double-blind  phase. The proportions of adverse events and serious adverse events were generally  similar between the treatment and placebo groups. Four economic evaluations of  biologic DMARDs for patients with JIA were identified but all had limitations. Two  quality-of-life studies were included, one of which informed the cost-utility model.  The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for adalimumab, etanercept and  tocilizumab versus methotrexate were £38,127, £32,526 and £38,656 per  quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. The ICER for abatacept versus  methotrexate as a second-line biologic was £39,536 per QALY. LIMITATIONS: The model  does not incorporate the natural history of JIA in terms of long-term disease  progression, as the current evidence is limited. There are no head-to-head trials of  biologic DMARDs, and clinical evidence for specific JIA subtypes is limited.  CONCLUSIONS: Biologic DMARDs are superior to placebo (with methotrexate where  permitted) in children with (predominantly) polyarticular course JIA who have had an  insufficient response to previous treatment. Randomised comparisons of biologic  DMARDs with long-term efficacy and safety follow-up are needed to establish  comparative effectiveness. RCTs for JIA subtypes for which evidence is lacking are  also required. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO  CRD42015016459.

Although IPD indirect comparisons are published  with increasing frequency in health care literature, there is no guidance on  selecting the appropriate methodology and on reporting the methods and results.  METHODS: In this paper we examine the methods and reporting of indirect comparison  methods using IPD. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL  from inception until October 2014. We included published and unpublished studies  reporting a method, application, or review of indirect comparisons using IPD and at  least three interventions. RESULTS: We identified 37 papers, including a total of 33  empirical networks. Of these, only 9 (27 %) IPD-NMAs reported the existence of a  study protocol, whereas 3 (9 %) studies mentioned that protocols existed without  providing a reference. The 33 empirical networks included 24 (73 %) IPD-NMAs and 9  (27 %) matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs). Of the 21 (64 %) networks  with at least one closed loop, 19 (90 %) were IPD-NMAs, 13 (68 %) of which evaluated  the prerequisite consistency assumption, and only 5 (38 %) of the 13 IPD-NMAs used  statistical approaches. The median number of trials included per network was 10 (IQR  4-19) (IPD-NMA: 15 [IQR 8-20]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 3-5]), and the median number of IPD  trials included in a network was 3 (IQR 1-9) (IPD-NMA: 6 [IQR 2-11]; MAIC: 2 [IQR  1-2]). Half of the networks (17; 52 %) applied Bayesian hierarchical models (14  one-stage, 1 two-stage, 1 used IPD as an informative prior, 1 unclear-stage),  including either IPD alone or with aggregated data (AD). Models for dichotomous and  continuous outcomes were available (IPD alone or combined with AD), as were models  for time-to-event data (IPD combined with AD). CONCLUSIONS: One in three indirect  comparison methods modeling IPD adjusted results from different trials to estimate  effects as if they had come from the same, randomized, population. Key  methodological and reporting elements (e.g., evaluation of consistency, existence of  study protocol) were often missing from an indirect comparison paper.",NA,"Veroniki, Areti Angeliki Straus, Sharon E Soobiah, Charlene Elliott, Meghan J Tricco, Andrea C",Veroniki AA Straus SE Soobiah C Elliott MJ Tricco AC,NA,"Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St. Michael's Hospital, 209 Victoria Street, East  Building, Toronto, ON, M5B 1T8, Canada.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of  Controlled Trials from inception through July 2015 for randomized clinical trials in  patients with Crohn's disease who reported response or remission with anti-TNF-α or  anti-integrin agents administered as induction and/or maintenance therapy. Data on  the study population, interventions, outcome measures, adverse events, and study  methods were extracted independently by 2 authors. FINDINGS: Among 2503 citations  identified, 23 met the eligibility criteria. Random-effects model meta-analyses and  network meta-analyses were performed. No statistically significant difference was  observed between anti-TNF-α and anti-integrin agents with respect to induction and  maintenance of response (odds ratio [OR] = 1.20 [95% CI, 0.73-1.96] from 14 trials  and OR = 1.23 [95% CI, 0.50-3.03] from 8 trials, respectively) or remission (OR =  1.13 [95% CI, 0.72-1.76] from 17 trials and OR = 1.18 [95% CI, 0.55-2.50] from 9  trials, respectively). No difference was observed in the indirect comparison of  trials that reported results on the subgroup of anti-TNF-α naive patients. The  proportions of patients with adverse events, infections, and treatment  discontinuations were similar between the agents. IMPLICATIONS: Our indirect  treatment comparisons did not find a statistically significant difference between  anti-TNF-α and anti-integrin agents for induction or maintenance therapy. In the  absence of head-to-head comparisons, it remains unclear which patient is more likely  to respond better to any of these agents.","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

The main  objective of this Bayesian network meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of  these different treatment strategies for early-stage HCC and rank these  interventions for practical consideration. We performed an electronic search of  PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, and extracted data from randomized controlled  trials that compared different interventional therapies for early-stage HCC. Direct  comparison and network meta-analyses were conducted with Aggregate Data Drug  Information System software. Consistency models were created to determine whether  there was a significant difference between any 2 therapies, and cumulative  probability was used to rank different treatments. Twenty-one randomized controlled  trials involving 2691 patients were included.

The outcome of melanoma depends on its stage at diagnosis. Currently, for  patients with advanced melanoma, two MEK inhibitors (trametinib and cobimetinib)  have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency. The main objective of this  study was to compare the relative efficacy of trametinib-dabrafenib and  cobimetinib-vemurafenib in patients with advanced melanoma through adjusted indirect  treatment comparisons (ITCs). METHODS: A search was made up to the 3rd of November  2015. Databases consulted were MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and the Centre for  Reviews and Dissemination. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the  efficacy of trametinib-dabrafenib or cobimetinib-vemurafenib versus a common  treatment comparator, in which outcomes of overall survival, progression-free  survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) were considered. ITCs were carried  out using the method proposed by Bucher et al. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Two RCTs were  included (one for each drugs combination). The results of the adjusted ITCs showed  that there were no statistically significant differences between the two  combinations in terms of PFS and ORR.

We sought to examine the relative treatment effect of  talimogene laherparepvec compared with ipilimumab and vemurafenib. METHODS: A  systematic literature review of treatments for metastatic melanoma was undertaken  but a valid network of evidence could not be established because of a lack of  comparative data or studies with sufficient common comparators. A conventional  adjusted indirect treatment comparison via network meta-analysis was, therefore, not  feasible. Instead, a meta-analysis of absolute efficacy was undertaken, adjusting  overall survival (OS) data for differences in prognostic factors between studies  using a published algorithm. RESULTS: Four trials were included in the final  indirect treatment comparison: two of ipilimumab, one of vemurafenib, and one of  talimogene laherparepvec. Median OS for ipilimumab and vemurafenib increased  significantly when adjustment was applied, demonstrating that variation in disease  and patient characteristics was biasing OS estimates; adjusting for this made the  survival data more comparable. For both ipilimumab and vemurafenib, the adjustments  improved Kaplan-Meier OS curves; the observed talimogene laherparepvec OS curve  remained above the adjusted OS curves for ipilimumab and vemurafenib, showing that  long-term survival could differ from the observed medians. CONCLUSION: Even with  limited data, talimogene laherparepvec, ipilimumab, and vemurafenib could be  compared following adjustments, thereby providing a more reliable understanding of  the relative effect of treatment on survival in a more comparable patient  population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hazard ratios (HRs) were obtained by modeling OS data with  the Weibull distribution. A fixed-effect Bayesian network meta-analysis was  conducted. The evidence network included anastrozole 1 mg, letrozole 2.5 mg,  fulvestrant 250 mg, exemestane 25 mg, megestrol acetate 40 mg, and everolimus 10 mg  plus exemestane 25 mg as comparators. Post-antiestrogen and post-aromatase inhibitor  subgroup networks were analyzed. RESULTS: In the overall analysis, the HRs suggested  improved OS for fulvestrant 500 mg versus fulvestrant 250 mg and megestrol acetate  40 mg, and numerically favorable differences with fulvestrant 500 mg versus other  comparators. In the antiestrogen subgroup, the HRs suggested improved OS for  fulvestrant 500 mg versus fulvestrant 250 mg and megestrol acetate 40 mg; numerical  differences in the HRs were seen versus anastrozole 1 mg and letrozole 2.5 mg. In  the aromatase inhibitor subgroup, the HRs for OS numerically favored fulvestrant 500  mg versus fulvestrant 250 mg and exemestane 25 mg. CONCLUSION: Acknowledging the  limitations of the present network meta-analysis, these findings suggest that  fulvestrant 500 mg might provide improved OS versus fulvestrant 250 mg and megestrol  acetate 40 mg for treatment of estrogen receptor-positive ABC following endocrine  therapy failure. Although OS efficacy versus everolimus 10 mg plus exemestane 25 mg  (for overall evidence network), anastrozole 1 mg, exemestane 25 mg, and letrozole  2.5 mg is numerically favorable, additional studies are required to draw formal  conclusions.",Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Yet direct  comparative trials between these agents in prevention of acute limb ischemia (ALI)  are unavailable so far. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an adjusted indirect comparison  meta-analysis between direct oral agents for prevention of acute limb ischemia in  atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review searching  electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase) and the Cochrane Library from January 1990  through November 2014. Two blinded investigators reviewed all potentially relevant  articles in a parallel manner by using a priori defined criteria. To assess the  long-term efficacy and safety of these agents, only randomized clinical trials  (RCTs) with follow-up durations of >1 year were included. The primary efficacy  outcome was the end point of acute limb ischemia and/or extremity embolism. RESULTS:  A total of 44,563 patients from three RCTs met criteria for inclusion. Patients  randomized to direct oral anticoagulants had a non-significant decreased risk for  acute limb ischemia (risk ratio [RR]: 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-1.2).  In the analysis between agents, however, rivaroxaban significantly lowered the risk  of ALI compared to warfarin (RR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.064-0.82), apixaban (RR: 0.26, 95%  CI: 0.081-0.83), and dabigatran (RR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.077-0.83).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project  was to summarise the evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness  of the MiniMed(®) Paradigm™ Veo system (Medtronic Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) and the  Vibe™ (Animas(®) Corporation, West Chester, PA, USA) and G4(®) PLATINUM CGM  (continuous glucose monitoring) system (Dexcom Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) in  comparison with multiple daily insulin injections (MDIs) or continuous subcutaneous  insulin infusion (CSII), both with either self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) or  CGM, for the management of T1DM in adults and children. DATA SOURCES: A systematic  review was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Centre for Reviews and  Dissemination guidance and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  Diagnostic Assessment Programme manual. We searched 14 databases, three trial  registries and two conference proceedings from study inception up to September 2014.  In addition, reference lists of relevant systematic reviews were checked. In the  absence of randomised controlled trials directly comparing Veo or an integrated  CSII + CGM system, such as Vibe, with comparator interventions, indirect treatment  comparisons were performed if possible. METHODS: A commercially available  cost-effectiveness model, the IMS Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness  diabetes model version 8.5 (IMS Health, Danbury, CT, USA), was used for this  assessment. This model is an internet-based, interactive simulation model that  predicts the long-term health outcomes and costs associated with the management of  T1DM and type 2 diabetes. The model consists of 15 submodels designed to simulate  diabetes-related complications, non-specific mortality and costs over time. As the  model simulates individual patients over time, it updates risk factors and  complications to account for disease progression. RESULTS: Fifty-four publications  resulting from 19 studies were included in the review. Overall, the evidence  suggests that the Veo system reduces hypoglycaemic events more than other  treatments, without any differences in other outcomes, including glycated  haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. We also found significant results in favour of the  integrated CSII + CGM system over MDIs with SMBG with regard to HbA1c levels and  quality of life. However, the evidence base was poor. The quality of the included  studies was generally low, often with only one study comparing treatments in a  specific population at a specific follow-up time. In particular, there was only one  study comparing Veo with an integrated CSII + CGM system and only one study  comparing Veo with a CSII + SMBG system in a mixed population. Cost-effectiveness  analyses indicated that MDI + SMBG is the option most likely to be cost-effective,  given the current threshold of £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained,  whereas integrated CSII + CGM systems and Veo are dominated and extendedly  dominated, respectively, by stand-alone, non-integrated CSII with CGM. Scenario  analyses did not alter these conclusions. No cost-effectiveness modelling was  conducted for children or pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: The Veo system does appear to  be better than the other systems considered at reducing hypoglycaemic events.  However, in adults, it is unlikely to be cost-effective. Integrated systems are also  generally unlikely to be cost-effective given that stand-alone systems are cheaper  and, possibly, no less effective. However, evidence in this regard is generally  lacking, in particular for children. Future trials in specific child, adolescent and  adult populations should include longer term follow-up and ratings on the European  Quality of Life-5 Dimensions scale at various time points with a view to informing  improved cost-effectiveness modelling.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate  the relative efficacy of mirabegron and onabotulinumtoxinA in patients with  idiopathic OAB. DESIGN: Network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: A search of 9  electronic databases, review documents, guidelines and websites. METHODS: Randomised  trials comparing any licensed dose of onabotulinumtoxinA or mirabegron with each  other, anticholinergic drugs or placebo were eligible (19 randomised trials were  identified). 1 reviewer extracted data from the studies and a second reviewer  checked the data. Candidate trials were assessed for similarity and networks were  developed for each outcome. Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using both  fixed-effects and random-effects models. When there were differences in mean  baseline values between mirabegron and onabotulinumtoxinA trials they were adjusted  for using network meta-regression (NMR). RESULTS: No studies directly comparing  onabotulinumtoxinA to mirabegron were identified. A network was created for each of  the 7 outcomes, with 3-9 studies included in each individual network. The trials  included in the networks were broadly similar. Patients in the onabotulinumtoxinA  trials had more urinary incontinence and urgency episodes at baseline than patients  in the mirabegron trials and these differences were adjusted for using NMR. Both  onabotulinumtoxinA and mirabegron were more efficacious than placebo at reducing the  frequency of urinary incontinence, urgency, urination and nocturia.  OnabotulinumtoxinA was more efficacious than mirabegron (50 and 25 mg) in completely  resolving daily episodes of urinary incontinence and urgency and in reducing the  frequency of urinary incontinence, urgency and urination. NMR supported the results  of the network meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head trials  comparing onabotulinumtoxinA to mirabegron, this indirect comparison indicates that  onabotulinumtoxinA may be superior to mirabegron in improving symptoms of urinary  incontinence, urgency and urinary frequency in patients with idiopathic OAB.",Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This study aimed to compare a currently  recommended immunosuppressive treatment, tacrolimus, against a newer treatment,  belatacept, using indirect treatment comparison (ITC) techniques since no  head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tacrolimus against  belatacept currently exist. METHODS: ITC was employed to calculate estimates for the  relative risks and mean difference of tacrolimus against belatacept. The choice of  the Bucher ITC model was driven by the available data and the simple indirect  treatment comparison involving three treatments was considered appropriate. RESULTS:  The results of the indirect analysis showed no significant differences between  belatacept and tacrolimus treatments for mortality and graft loss. The acute  rejection rate was significantly lower with tacrolimus (Prograf* and Advagraf (*) )  compared with belatacept (0.22 [0.13, 0.39] to 0.44 [0.20, 0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: The  results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that tacrolimus is  significantly superior to belatacept in terms of acute rejection outcomes but  comparable for graft and patient survival. Further research should include a  properly designed clinical trial comparing tacrolimus against belatacept directly.  LIMITATIONS: These include variations in terms of clinical and design differences  among the trials, weaknesses in the Bucher method and the lack of long-term clinical  trial data with tacrolimus to compare with the recent long-term (7 years) belatacept  trial data.",NA,"Muduma, G Hart, W M Patel, S Odeyemi, A O",Muduma G Hart WM Patel S Odeyemi AO,NA,"a Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd , Chertsey, Surrey , UK ; b EcoStat Consulting UK Ltd , Norfolk , UK. a Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd , Chertsey, Surrey , UK ; b EcoStat Consulting UK Ltd , Norfolk , UK.",eng,NA,Comparative Study Journal Article Meta-Analysis Review Systematic Review,20160330,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,NOTNLM,*Belatacept *Bucher method *Indirect treatment comparison *Tacrolimus,2016/02/26 06:00,2017/09/05 06:00,2016/02/25 06:00,2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez] 2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed] 2017/09/05 06:00 [medline],10.1185/03007995.2016.1157463 [doi],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2016 Jun;32(6):1065-72. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2016.1157463.

A systematic  review was conducted to assess the clinical efficacy, safety and effect of all  first-line treatments evaluated to date on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A  systematic search of Embase, Cochrane and MEDLINE databases was performed to  identify randomized controlled trials (1980-2015) evaluating any targeted  therapy/immunotherapy against placebo or any other targeted  intervention/immunotherapy in treatment-naive patients with metastatic renal cell  carcinoma. Conference proceedings from major cancer congresses (2007-2015) were  handsearched. Sixteen randomized controlled trials were identified, mostly phase  III. Overall, targeted therapies were associated with either improved [sunitinib,  bevacizumab+interferon α (IFNα) and temsirolimus] or comparable (sorafenib)  progression-free survival (PFS) versus IFNα monotherapy. Sunitinib demonstrated  comparable PFS and overall survival to pazopanib, comparable PFS to sorafenib and  shorter PFS compared with bevacizumab+IFNα (although no conclusions were made with  regard to superiority/inferiority). Compared with sorafenib, tivozanib demonstrated  a significantly longer PFS, and both tivozanib and axitinib demonstrated higher  response rates. Nintedanib demonstrated comparable PFS and overall survival to  sunitinib in a phase II trial. Temsirolimus, sunitinib and sorafenib treatment led  to better HRQoL versus IFNα; pazopanib was associated with better HRQoL versus  sunitinib. No direct meta-analyses or indirect treatment comparison analysis were  undertaken because of noncomparability of the trials. In general, targeted therapies  demonstrated favourable clinical efficacy and improved HRQoL compared with IFNα  monotherapy. The newer therapies, tivozanib and axitinib (but not nintedanib),  appeared to exhibit greater clinical benefit (response rate) than older tyrosine  kinase inhibitors.",NA,"Takyar, Shweta Diaz, Jose Sehgal, Manu Sapunar, Francisco Pandha, Hardev",Takyar S Diaz J Sehgal M Sapunar F Pandha H,NA,"aPAREXEL International, Chandigarh, India bNovartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland  cAstraZeneca, Cambridge dDepartment of Oncology, University of Surrey, Surrey, UK.",eng,NA,"Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Systematic Review",NA,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,NA,NA,2016/02/18 06:00,2016/08/17 06:00,2016/02/18 06:00,2016/02/18 06:00 [entrez] 2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed] 2016/08/17 06:00 [medline],10.1097/CAD.0000000000000335 [doi],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2016 Jun;27(5):383-97. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000335.,27,5,383-97,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20160816,0 (Antineoplastic Agents) 0 (Imidazoles) 0 (Indazoles) 0 (Indoles) 0 (Interferon-alpha) 0 (Phenylurea Compounds) 0 (Pyrimidines) 0 (Pyrroles) 0 (Quinazolines) 0 (Quinolines) 0 (Sulfonamides) 172030934T (tivozanib) 25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide) 2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab) 624KN6GM2T (temsirolimus) 7RN5DR86CK (pazopanib) 9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib) C9LVQ0YUXG (Axitinib) G6HRD2P839 (nintedanib) NQU9IPY4K9 (cediranib) V99T50803M (Sunitinib) W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus),"Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use Axitinib Bevacizumab/adverse effects/therapeutic use Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/psychology Humans Imidazoles/adverse effects/therapeutic use Indazoles/adverse effects/therapeutic use Indoles/adverse effects/therapeutic use Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/therapeutic use Kidney Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology Neoplasm Metastasis Niacinamide/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use Phenylurea Compounds/adverse effects/therapeutic use Pyrimidines/adverse effects/therapeutic use Pyrroles/adverse effects/therapeutic use Quality of Life Quinazolines/adverse effects/therapeutic use Quinolines/adverse effects/therapeutic use Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Sirolimus/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use Sorafenib Sulfonamides/adverse effects/therapeutic use Sunitinib",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: A systematic literature  review performed in March 2014, using a predefined search strategy in MEDLINE,  EMBASE and Cochrane Library, identified 17 randomized placebo-controlled trials,  (tiotropium n = 15; aclidinium/formoterol n = 2). Outcomes of interest were:  bronchodilation (peak and trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)), COPD  symptoms [Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score and % of responders (>1 unit  improvement)] and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) [St. George's Respiratory  Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and % responders (>4 unit improvement)], % of  patients with ≥1 exacerbations, adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE),  hospitalization and mortality, all at 24 weeks. In the absence of head-to-head  trials between aclidinium/formoterol and tiotropium, a Bayesian indirect treatment  comparison (ITC) was used with placebo as common control. RESULTS: Regarding  bronchodilation, aclidinium/formoterol was found to be more efficacious than  tiotropium at peak FEV1, with mean difference in change from baseline (DCFB) 143 mL  [95% credible interval (CrI): 112, 174] and at trough FEV1 [DCFB 26 mL (95% CrI -2,  55)]. Aclidinium/formoterol is expected to be more efficacious than tiotropium in  improving dyspnea symptoms measured by TDI [DCFB 0.54 points (95% CrI 0.09, 0.99);  odds ratio (OR) of responders 1.51 (95% CrI 1.11, 2.06)]. SGRQ results are  comparable for aclidinium/formoterol versus tiotropium [DCFB -0.52 (95% CrI -2.21,  1.17); OR of responders 1.16 (95% CrI 0.47, 2.87)]. The ITC results suggest similar  safety profiles regarding AEs, SAEs and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Based on the  ITC, aclidinium/formoterol is expected to be more efficacious than tiotropium in  terms of lung function and symptom control while providing comparable HRQoL results  and safety profile.

They can also be  extended to study comparative effectiveness, testing which of several alternative  interventions is expected to have the strongest effect. This often requires network  meta-analysis (NMA), which combines trials involving direct comparison of two  interventions within the same trial and indirect comparisons across trials. In this  paper, we extend existing network methods for main effects to examining moderator  effects, allowing for tests of whether intervention effects vary for different  populations or when employed in different contexts. In addition, we study how the  use of individual participant data may increase the sensitivity of NMA for detecting  moderator effects, as compared with aggregate data NMA that employs study-level  effect sizes in a meta-regression framework. A new NMA diagram is proposed. We also  develop a generalized multilevel model for NMA that takes into account within-trial  and between-trial heterogeneity and can include participant-level covariates. Within  this framework, we present definitions of homogeneity and consistency across trials.  A simulation study based on this model is used to assess effects on power to detect  both main and moderator effects. Results show that power to detect moderation is  substantially greater when applied to individual participant data as compared with  study-level effects. We illustrate the use of this method by applying it to data  from a classroom-based randomized study that involved two sub-trials, each comparing  interventions that were contrasted with separate control groups.

METHODS: A systematic literature review of Phase  III clinical trials identified 2 trials of SOF+R-PHOTON-1 (A Phase 3, Open-Label  Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of GS-7977 Plus Ribavirin in Chronic  Genotype 1, 2 and 3 Hepatitis C Virus [HCV] and Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV]  Co-Infected Subjects) and PHOTON-2 (A Phase 3, Open-Label Study to Investigate the  Efficacy and Safety of Sofosbuvir Plus Ribavirin in Chronic Genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4  Hepatitis C Virus [HCV] and Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV] Co-Infected Subjects)  suitable for comparison with the trial of DCV+SOF in patients coinfected with HIV  and HCV-ALLY-2 (A Phase 3 Evaluation of Daclatasvir Plus Sofosbuvir in  Treatment-naïve and Treatment-experienced Chronic Hepatitis C [Genotype 1, 2, 3, 4,  5, or 6] Subjects Coinfected With Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV]). Individual  patient data from ALLY-2 were available; published summary data were extracted and  pooled for the PHOTON trials. To adjust for cross-trial differences, ALLY-2 patients  were subject to the inclusion and exclusion criteria reported in the PHOTON trials  and were weighted to match all available summary baseline characteristics reported  in both PHOTON trials. Sustained virologic response at week 12 post-treatment  (SVR12) discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) and rates of AEs were compared.  FINDINGS: The SVR12 rate was significantly higher among patients treated with  DCV+SOF (n = 91) than among those treated with SOF+R (n = 455) both before (96.7% vs  84.6%; P = 0.002) and after (99.9% vs 84.6%; P < 0.001) adjusting for baseline  characteristics. After adjustment, compared with patients treated with SOF+R,  patients receiving DCV+SOF had a significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to  AEs and significantly lower rates of the following specific AEs: cough, diarrhea,  insomnia, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and hemoglobin <10  g/dL. IMPLICATIONS: After adjustment for cross-trial differences in baseline  characteristics, DCV+SOF was associated with a significantly higher SVR12 rate and  lower rate of discontinuation due to AEs than SOF+R in patients coinfected with HIV  and HCV.","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

Recently, nintedanib and  pirfenidone demonstrated efficacy in slowing disease progression and were approved  by the US Food and Drug Administration. Although numerous treatments have been  evaluated in IPF, none have shown significant decreases in mortality. The objective  of this study was to identify all pharmacologic treatments evaluated for IPF and  analyze their efficacy via Bayesian network meta-analysis and pairwise indirect  treatment comparisons. This review did not evaluate the effect of steroid therapy.  METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published  on or before August 2014. Studies were required to contain a randomized evaluation  of nonsteroidal drug therapy for treatment of IPF and be published in English. Key  outcomes of interest for this analysis were pulmonary function as measured by FVC as  well as all-cause and respiratory-specific death. All outcomes were analyzed via a  Bayesian framework. RESULTS: Our review identified 30 eligible studies that  evaluated 16 unique treatments. Under both the fixed-effect and random-effect models  for respiratory-specific mortality, no treatments performed better than placebo. For  all-cause mortality, pirfenidone and nintedanib had effects approaching significance  with credible intervals slightly crossing the null under a fixed-effect model.  Notably, for respiratory-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, and decline in  percent predicted FVC, nintedanib and pirfenidone were virtually indistinguishable  and no clear advantage was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Although two treatments have been  approved for IPF on the basis of reduced decline in pulmonary function, neither one  has a clear advantage on mortality outcomes.",Copyright © 2016 American College of Chest Physicians.

Methods Individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed for treatment  lines composing four treatment sequences. Parametric models were tested to select  the model that best fits the IPD. The transitional probability equations, used for  disease progression modeling, were obtained by substituting the parameters of the  general equation for transitional probabilities by the parameters estimated from  fitted distributions. Results The log-logistic model best fitted the reconstructed  data for progression-free and overall survival curves for each line of treatment.  The shapes and scales of the log-logistic models were used to develop the  transitional probability equations for the HER2+ mBC simulation model. KEY  LIMITATIONS: The estimation of the transitional probabilities depends heavily on the  accuracy of the IPD reconstruction. Nonetheless, analytical and graphical tests can  be performed to check the face validity of the reconstructed data. Additionally,  sensitivity analyses can be conducted to test the impact of uncertainty surrounding  the estimated parameters defining equations for transitional probabilities.  Conclusion The results of this study can be used as input in model-based economic  evaluations of sequential therapy for HER2+ mBC.",NA,"Diaby, Vakaramoko Ali, Askal A Adunlin, Georges Kohn, Christine G Montero, Alberto J",Diaby V Ali AA Adunlin G Kohn CG Montero AJ,NA,"a College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Florida A&M University ,  Tallahassee , FL , USA ; a College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Florida A&M University ,  Tallahassee , FL , USA ; b Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine , Richmond , VA , USA ; c University of Saint Joseph School of Pharmacy, Hartford Hospital Evidence-based  Practice Center , Hartford , CT , USA ; d Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute , Department of Solid Tumor Oncology ,  Cleveland , OH , USA.",eng,G12 MD007582/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States P20 MD006738/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States R25 CA093423/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,Journal Article,20160302,NA,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,NOTNLM,*Disease progression modeling *HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer *Individual patient data reconstruction *Sequential therapy *Transitional probabilities,2016/01/30 06:00,2017/09/05 06:00,2016/01/30 06:00,2016/01/30 06:00 [entrez] 2016/01/30 06:00 [pubmed] 2017/09/05 06:00 [medline],10.1185/03007995.2016.1149056 [doi],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2016 Jun;32(6):991-6. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2016.1149056.

A comprehensive  literature search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials comparing  noninvasive weaning at spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure after meeting  simple weaning criteria or at the pulmonary infection control window (PIC window)  with conventional invasive weaning in COPD patients. Using conventional invasive  weaning as a bridge, we indirectly compared the two noninvasive weaning strategies  using the Bucher approach. Noninvasive weaning at SBT failure after meeting simple  weaning criteria was associated with an extended duration of endotracheal mechanical  ventilation (standardized mean difference 1.90, 95% CI 1.27-2.53, P < 0.001)  compared with noninvasive weaning at the PIC window. No significant differences in  mortality or the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia were observed. Our study  suggests that the PIC window may be a promising switching time for noninvasive  weaning in COPD patients.",Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular  mortality, cardiovascular hospitalization and hospitalization for worsening HF.  METHODS: We conducted a search of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases until 31st  December 2014 for randomized control trials (RCTs) in HF evaluating statins versus  placebo. Identified RCTs and their respective abstracted information were grouped  according to statin type evaluated and analyzed separately. Outcomes were initially  pooled with the Peto's one-step method, producing odd ratios (OR) and 95 %  confidence intervals (CI) for each statin type. Using these pooled estimates, we  performed adjusted indirect comparisons of lipophilic versus hydrophilic statin for  each outcome. RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 10,966 patients were identified  and analyzed. Lipophilic statins were superior to hydrophilic rosuvastatin regarding  all-cause mortality (OR 0 · 50; 95 % CI, 0 · 11-0 · 89; p = 0 · 01), cardiovascular  mortality (OR 0 · 61; 0 · 25-0 · 97; p = 0 · 009), and hospitalization for worsening  HF (OR 0 · 52; 0 · 21-0 · 83; p = 0 · 0005). However, both statins were comparable  with regards to cardiovascular hospitalization [OR 0 · 80 (0 · 31, 1 · 28);  p = 0 · 36]. CONCLUSIONS: Lipophilic statin treatment shows significant decreases in  all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for worsening HF  compared with rosuvastatin treatment.

To date, little research has been conducted on the treatment effect in  different subgroups of patients with AD. The aim of this study is to examine the  comparative effectiveness and safety of cognitive enhancers for different patient  characteristics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will update our previous literature search  from January 2015 forward, using the same terms and electronic databases (eg,  MEDLINE) from our previous review. We will additionally search grey literature and  scan the reference lists of the included studies. Randomised clinical trials of any  duration conducted at any time comparing cognitive enhancers alone or in any  combination against other cognitive enhancers, or placebo in adults with AD will be  eligible. The outcomes of interest are cognition according to the Mini-Mental State  Examination, and overall serious adverse events. For each outcome and treatment  comparison, we will perform a Bayesian hierarchical random-effects meta-analysis  combining the individual patient data (IPD) from each eligible study. If the  identified treatment comparisons form a connected network diagram, we will perform  an IPD network meta-analysis (NMA) to estimate subgroup effects for patients with  different characteristics, such as AD severity and sex. We will combine aggregated  data from studies that we will not be able to obtain IPD, with the IPD provided by  the original authors, in a single model. We will use the PRISMA-IPD and PRISMA-NMA  statements to report our findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings of this  study will be of interest to stakeholders, including decision makers, guideline  developers, clinicians, methodologists and patients, and they will help to improve  guidelines for the management of patients with AD.

The usefulness of pairwise meta-analysis is thus limited in  real-life medical practice, where many competing interventions may be available for  a certain condition and studies informing some of the pairwise comparisons may be  lacking. This commonly encountered scenario has led to the development of network  meta-analysis (NMA). In the last decade, several applications, methodological  developments, and empirical studies in NMA have been published, and the area is  thriving as its relevance to public health is increasingly recognized.

To further clarify the clinical position of SOX in  advanced gastric cancer (AGC), a meta-analysis including information from other  reported studies was conducted. METHODS: In addition to G-SOX, Japanese phase III  clinical trials including S-1 monotherapy were included in the analyses. Individual  patient data for SOX (318 patients) and CS (324 patients) from G-SOX, as well as  those for S-1 (160 patients) from the Randomized Phase III Study Comparing the  Efficacy and Safety of Irinotecan plus S-1 with S-1 Alone as First-line Treatment  for Advanced Gastric Cancer (GC0301/TOP-002), were available. Published clinical  information for S-1 from other studies (total 705 patients) was also collected. A  Weibull distribution was assumed for overall survival time, and parameters for SOX,  CS, and S-1 were estimated parametrically. Posterior HR distributions were obtained  with a Bayesian approach. RESULTS: The HR of SOX to S-1 was 0.817 (95 % credible  interval 0.704-0.939), and the probability of the HR <1.00 was 99.8 %. The HR of CS  to S-1 was 0.871 (95 % credible interval; 0.754-0.998), and the probability of the  HR <1.00 was 97.6 %.

In a randomized  head-to-head trial, liraglutide 1.8 mg q.d. led to greater reductions in HbA1c than  exenatide 10 μg b.i.d. There are no direct comparisons of liraglutide 1.2 mg q.d.  and exenatide b.i.d.; therefore, in the present study, an indirect comparison and  meta-analysis were undertaken. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed  for randomized controlled trials of liraglutide 1.2 mg q.d. or exenatide b.i.d. with  HbA1c as an outcome and ≥25 subjects. Key data were extracted and analyzed. A  random-effects model was used to incorporate heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS:  Three liraglutide 1.2 mg q.d. (n = 1060) and 10 exenatide b.i.d. (n = 2609)  placebo-controlled studies were identified, allowing indirect comparison with  placebo as the common arm. Baseline characteristics were mean age ~55 years, disease  duration ~7 years, HbA1c ~8%, and body mass index ~32 kg/m(2) . Compared with  exenatide b.i.d., liraglutide 1.2 mg was associated with significantly greater  reductions from baseline in HbA1c (-0.29%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.53,  -0.05) and fasting plasma glucose (-0.92 mmol/L; 95% CI -1.43, -0.41), with shorter  duration of nausea (3 vs 14 days; P = 0.002) and fewer withdrawals (odds ratio 0.34;  95% CI 0.22, 0.52). The incidence of adverse events (including nausea) and  withdrawals because of adverse events were similar between treatments. CONCLUSIONS:  Liraglutide 1.2 mg provided a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c than  exenatide 10 μg b.i.d. The significantly shorter duration of nausea with liraglutide  than exenatide may be appreciated by patients.","© 2016 The Authors.

Currently, there is a lack of high  quality evidence to support the tailoring of insulin regimens according to an  individual's needs. The aim of this study is to update our previous systematic  review and perform an individual patient data network meta-analysis (IPD-NMA) to  evaluate the comparative safety and effectiveness of long-acting versus  intermediate-acting insulin in different subgroups of patients with T1DM. METHODS  AND ANALYSIS: We will update our previous literature search from January 2013  onwards searching relevant electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE), as well as perform  grey literature search through relevant society/association websites, and conference  abstracts, and scan reference lists of the eligible studies. We will include  randomised clinical trials of any duration examining long-acting versus  intermediate-acting insulin preparations for adult patients with T1DM. We will focus  on A1C and severe hypoglycaemia outcomes. For each pairwise treatment comparison, we  will combine all IPD from all studies in a single multilevel model, where each study  is a different cluster. For a connected network of trials, we will perform an  IPD-NMA to identify potential effect modifiers, and estimate the most effective and  safe treatments for patients with different characteristics. If we are not  successful in obtaining IPD for at least one study, we will include aggregated data  (AD) abstracted from the included RCTs in our analysis, combining IPD and AD into a  single model. We will report our results using the PRISMA-IPD statement. ETHICS AND  DISSEMINATION: The results of this systematic review and IPD-NMA will be of interest  to stakeholders and will help in improving existing guideline recommendations.

METHODS: A systematic literature search for  phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing first-line chemotherapies  approved in Germany and recommended by guidelines at the time of study design was  conducted. Random-effects meta-analysis (MA) was used for direct and the Bucher  method for adjusted indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: One RCT comparing  melphalan and prednisone plus bortezomib (VMP) vs. melphalan and prednisone (MP) and  six RCTs comparing MP plus thalidomide (MPT) vs. MP were analysed. For MPT vs. MP,  an individual patient data (IPD) MA was used for sensitivity analyses. VMP and MPT  were superior to MP regarding efficacy endpoints (VMP vs. MP, overall survival (OS):  hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.86; progression-free  survival (PFS): HR 0.56, 0.39-0.79; complete response (CR), risk-ratio (RR) for  non-response: 0.70, 0.65-0.75; MPT vs. MP, OS: HR 0.83, 0.66-1.03; PFS: HR 0.67,  0.56-0.81; CR, RR for non-response 0.92, 0.88-0.95); but had a higher risk of  developing any grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) (VMP vs. MP: RR 1.13, 1.06-1.20; MPT  vs. MP: RR 2.06, 1.43-2.98). The indirect comparison of VMP vs. MPT via MP showed a  statistically not significant advantage for VMP regarding survival outcomes (OS: HR  0.85, 0.63-1.14; PFS: HR 0.83, 0.56-1.23) and a significant advantage regarding CR  (RR for non-response 0.76, 0.70-0.83) and AEs (RR 0.55, 0.38-0.80). Treatment  comparisons using results of IPD MA yielded similar effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: VMP  and MPT seem more effective than MP, VMP was superior to MPT regarding response  criteria and AEs.

METHODS: A systematic  search was conducted for monotherapy studies in patients with MDD with inadequate  response to first-line therapy. Treatments included SSRIs, SNRIs, and other  antidepressants. Identified studies underwent a three-stage screening/data  extraction process and critical appraisal. Adjusted indirect treatment comparisons  (ITCs) on systematic literature review outputs were made using Bucher's method,  comparing remission rates and withdrawal rates due to adverse events (AEs). RESULTS:  Of 27 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, a few studies were of high quality  according to the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence checklist. Three  studies contributed to an evidence network for quantitative assessment comparing  vortioxetine with agomelatine, sertraline, venlafaxine XR, and bupropion SR.  Vortioxetine had a statistically significantly higher remission rate than  agomelatine (risk difference [RD]: -11.0% [95% CI: -19.4; -2.6]), and numerically  higher remission rates than sertraline (RD: -14.4% [95% CI: -29.9; 1.1]),  venlafaxine (RD: -7.20% [95% CI: -24.3; 9.9]), and bupropion (RD: -10.70% [95% CI:  -27.8; 6.4]). Withdrawal rates due to AEs were statistically significantly lower for  vortioxetine than sertraline (RD: 12.1% [95% CI: 3.1; 21.1]), venlafaxine XR (RD:  12.3% [95% CI: 0.8; 23.8]), and bupropion SR (RD: 18.3% [95% CI: 6.4; 30.1]).  CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic literature review found a few high quality  switch studies assessing monotherapies in patients with MDD with inadequate response  to SSRI/SNRIs. ITCs indicated that switching to vortioxetine leads to numerically  higher remission rates compared with other antidepressants. Vortioxetine is a well  tolerated treatment, showing statistically lower withdrawal rates due to AEs  compared with other antidepressants. Vortioxetine is a relevant therapeutic  alternative in patients experiencing inadequate response to prior SSRI or SNRI  therapy.",NA,"Brignone, Mélanie Diamand, Françoise Painchault, Caroline Takyar, Shweta",Brignone M Diamand F Painchault C Takyar S,NA,"a a Lundbeck SAS , Paris , France. a a Lundbeck SAS , Paris , France. b b Keyrus Biopharma , Levallois Perret , France. c c Parexel International , Chandigarh , India.",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Systematic Review",NA,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,NOTNLM,Indirect treatment comparison Major depressive disorder Switch study Systematic literature review Vortioxetine,2015/12/05 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,2015/12/05 06:00,2015/12/05 06:00 [entrez] 2015/12/05 06:00 [pubmed] 2016/08/30 06:00 [medline],10.1185/03007995.2015.1128404 [doi],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2016;32(2):351-66. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2015.1128404.,32,2,351-66,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20160829,0 (Antidepressive Agents) 0 (Piperazines) 0 (Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors) 0 (Sulfides) 3O2K1S3WQV (Vortioxetine),"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy Humans Piperazines/*therapeutic use Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use Sulfides/*therapeutic use Vortioxetine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Individual patient data from the RECORD-1 (Renal Cell  Cancer Treatment With Oral RAD001 Given Daily) Phase III clinical trial provided  information for patients taking everolimus. Summary baseline clinical and  demographic characteristics and progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes were  available for patients taking axitinib who were included in the AXIS (axitinib  versus sorafenib) Phase III clinical trial. A Bayesian latent class mixture model  differentiating responders and nonresponders and with imbedded Weibull regression on  PFS was used to identify sex, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk score, and  time receiving prior sunitinib therapy as prognostic factors for PFS based on  posterior probability >95%. Patients taking everolimus were weighted up or down  based on their combination of prognostic variables. Weights were calculated by  dividing the proportion of patients observed in AXIS for a given characteristic by  the proportion observed in RECORD-1 and taking the product of the values derived for  all three weighting variables considered. Weighted PFS distributions were derived  with bootstrapped 95% CIs and compared with those reported for the AXIS trial.  FINDINGS: After weighting, distributions of the 3 key baseline characteristics were  more closely aligned between the 2 studies; however, some differences remained. A  slightly lower rate of poor-risk patients was evident in RECORD-1 (30%) versus AXIS  (36%), and a 9% lower proportion of males was observed in the everolimus group  compared with the axitinib group. Distributions of time receiving prior sunitinib  therapy were almost equivalent between the treatment arms. A median PFS of 4.7  months (95% CI, 3.5-10.6 months) was observed for patients in the weighted  everolimus group compared with 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.5-6.4 months) in the AXIS  trial. IMPLICATIONS: Similar median PFS point estimates and overlapping CIs suggest  that everolimus and axitinib have similar efficacy. Although these results do not  negate the need for direct comparison, this study may be used to inform clinical and  reimbursement decisions until such evidence is available.",Copyright © 2015.

We developed a Phase 2  trial which is a small n sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (snSMART)  design to test several treatments for a rare disease for which no standard therapy  exists. PURPOSE: This paper illustrates the design, sample size estimation and  operating characteristics of an snSMART. METHODS: We investigate the performance of  a class of weighted Z statistics via computer simulations. RESULTS: We demonstrate  the increase in power over traditional single stage designs, and indicate how the  power changes as a function of the weight given to each stage. CONCLUSION: The  snSMART design is promising in a rare disease setting where several alternative  treatments are under consideration and small sample sizes are necessary.",Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Effective treatment is a significant  economic burden on the Italian healthcare system. Economic models in RA are commonly  based on indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: This study assessed the  cost-effectiveness of abatacept relative to adalimumab for RA in Italy based on a  head-to-head trial by means of a cost-consequence analysis. RESULTS: Health benefits  based on the most stringent efficacy criteria were in favor of abatacept compared to  adalimumab. Rates for more costly adverse events were higher for adalimumab compared  to abatacept, which was reflected in the lower costs for abatacept (-€237,246 or  -€237per patient). CONCLUSION: The health economic value of abatacept compared with  adalimumab from the perspective of the Italian NHS depends on the choice of health  outcome.

METHODS: A previously developed and validated  Markov model was adapted to evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic impact of  apixaban 5 mg BID versus edoxaban (high and low dose) in patients with nonvalvular  atrial fibrillation. A pairwise indirect treatment comparison was conducted for  clinical end points, and price parity was assumed between apixaban and edoxaban.  Costs in 2012 British pounds, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)  gained, discounted at 3.5% per annum, were estimated. FINDINGS: Apixaban was  predicted to increase life expectancy and QALYs versus low- and high-dose edoxaban.  These gains were achieved at cost-savings versus low-dose edoxaban, thus being  dominant and nominal increases in costs versus high-dose edoxaban. The incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio of apixaban versus high-dose edoxaban was £6763 per QALY  gained. IMPLICATIONS: Apixaban was deemed to be dominant (less costly and more  effective) versus low-dose edoxaban and a cost-effective alternative to high-dose  edoxaban.",Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

The use  of matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) in this situation has been  suggested. We present the results of a MAIC used to evaluate the incremental benefit  offered by adding simeprevir (SMV) to standard therapy in the treatment of patients  infected with genotype 4 hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: Individual patient data  for a single arm study evaluating the use of SMV with peginterferon alfa  2a + ribavirin (PR) in genotype 4 HCV were available (RESTORE study). A systematic  literature review was used to identify studies of PR alone used in the same patient  group. By applying the inclusion criteria for each study in turn to the RESTORE  dataset and then applying the published MAIC covariate matching algorithm, a series  of pseudosamples from RESTORE were generated. After assessment of the matching  outcomes, the best matched comparisons were used to derive estimates of efficacy for  SMV + PR in patients equivalent to those participating in the PR trial. RESULTS:  Five potential comparator studies were identified. After applying the matching  process, two emerged as offering the greatest equivalence with the generated RESTORE  pseudosamples and were used to estimate SMV + PR efficacy, expressed as the  percentage of patients achieving sustained viral response (SVR). In one comparison,  SVR in the SMV + PR group was 85% versus 63% for PR alone. In the second comparison,  the corresponding SVRs were 77% and 44% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After matching  for varying baseline characteristics, both comparisons of RESTORE versus studies of  PR alone yielded a benefit for SMV + PR vs PR alone in genotype 4 HCV-infected  patients. The incremental gain in SVR associated with use of SMV ranged from 22% to  33%. In the absence of direct comparative studies, the MAIC gives a better  perspective than simple comparison of absolute SVR from individual studies.",NA,"Van Sanden, Suzy Pisini, Marta Duchesne, Inge Mehnert, Angelika Belsey, Jonathan",Van Sanden S Pisini M Duchesne I Mehnert A Belsey J,NA,"a a Janssen Pharmaceutica NV , Beerse , Belgium. a a Janssen Pharmaceutica NV , Beerse , Belgium. a a Janssen Pharmaceutica NV , Beerse , Belgium. b b Janssen-Cilag GmbH , Neuss , Germany. c c JB Medical Ltd , Sudbury , UK.",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20151029,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,NOTNLM,Genotype 4 hepatitis C virus HCV infection MAIC Matching adjusted indirect comparison Peginterferon alpha 2a + ribavirin Simeprevir,2015/10/13 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,2015/10/13 06:00,2015/10/13 06:00 [entrez] 2015/10/13 06:00 [pubmed] 2016/09/10 06:00 [medline],10.1185/03007995.2015.1106934 [doi],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2016;32(1):147-54. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2015.1106934.

In the dossier on vortioxetine for the  assessment of the acute treatment of patients with moderate and severe major  depressive episodes, the pharmaceutical company (hereinafter referred as “the  company”) had presented an adjusted indirect comparison in comparison with the  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram using a common comparator  placebo. The dossier assessment on vortioxetine showed that the results presented by  the company were unsuitable for the assessment of the added benefit of vortioxetine.  This was largely due to the fact that the company made an inadequate limitation of  the study pool for the meta-analyses of the indirect comparison and did not consider  the available evidence completely. In its comment, the company submitted  supplementary analyses on the indirect comparison, which went beyond the information  provided in the dossier. Moreover, the company in its comments referred to a study  of direct comparison of vortioxetine versus the SSRI escitalopram (study 318), which  the company had not included in the dossier for the assessment of the added benefit.  The G-BA commissioned IQWiG with the assessment of the additional data on the  indirect comparison and of study 318.

They differ with  respect to several factors including estradiol concentration and surface  application, and cannot be compared solely on the basis of their estradiol dose. No  randomized clinical trials have compared them head to head, but both have been  compared with placebo. Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct a  systematic review and network meta-analysis of the two estradiol gels. METHODS: We  performed a comprehensive systematic literature review. One publication reporting on  one Divigel trial, three publications reporting on two Estrogel trials, and five  publications reporting on other estradiol transdermal preparations were identified.  Efficacy outcomes were change from baseline in daily hot flush frequency and change  from baseline in daily hot flush severity. Safety outcomes were frequency of  treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and frequency of treatment-emergent AEs  leading to discontinuation. Bayesian indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis of  trial-level data was performed in accordance with the International Society for  Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, National  Pharmaceutical Council (ISPOR-AMCP-NPC) Good Practice Questionnaire. All outcomes  were compared with respect to doses of the considered preparations. RESULTS: For hot  flush frequency, Divigel 0.25 mg was similar to Divigel 0.5 mg and to Estrogel  0.75 mg, and was statistically significantly superior to Estrogel 1.5 mg. The  largest effect was observed with Divigel 1.0 mg (mean difference of 3.91 hot  flushes/wk vs placebo), and was statistically significantly superior to all other  interventions. The 1.5 mg Estrogel dose was associated with the smallest estimate of  efficacy. For hot flush severity, Divigel 0.25 mg was similar to the efficacy of  Divigel 0.5 mg, and for 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg of other estradiol gels, but was  statistically inferior to Divigel 1.0 mg, Estrogel 0.75 mg, Estrogel 1.5 mg, and the  1.0 and 1.5 mg doses of all other estradiol gels. The estimated efficacy of Divigel  0.5 mg was similar to that of Estrogel 0.75 mg, Estrogel 1.5 mg, and the 0.25 and  0.5 mg doses of other transdermal estradiol preparations. Risks of treatment-related  AEs for Divigel 0.25 mg, Divigel 0.5 mg, Estrogel 0.75 mg, and Estrogel 1.5 mg were  similar and all were of a slightly higher risk than placebo. Among these, Divigel  1.0 mg, Estrogel 1.5 mg, and other gels 0.5 mg were statistically significantly less  safe than placebo. However, for treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation,  none of the gels were associated with statistically significantly higher relative  risks compared with placebo. In this study, statistically significant refers to the  95% credible intervals used in the Bayesian Network Analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Using  network meta-analysis for indirect treatment comparison, we have shown that the  efficacy of Divigel 0.25 mg, as measured by reduced hot flush frequency and  severity, was similar to that of Divigel 0.5 mg and of Estrogel 0.75 and 1.5 mg.  Overall, our analysis showed that Divigel 1.0 mg provided the best efficacy profile,  but that this treatment was also associated with a higher risk of AEs. The network  meta-analysis also showed that treatment with Estrogel 1.5 mg was associated with  the smallest estimate of reduction in frequency of hot flushes.",NA,"Derzko, Christine Sergerie, Martin Siliman, Gaye Alberton, Mark Thorlund, Kristian",Derzko C Sergerie M Siliman G Alberton M Thorlund K,NA,"1Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Division of Endocrinology, Department of  Medicine, St Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario 2Teva  Canada Innovation, Montreal, Quebec 3Redwood Outcomes Inc, Vancouver, British  Columbia 4Department of Clinical Epidemiology & Biostatistics, McMaster University,  Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Meta-Analysis Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Systematic Review",NA,United States,Menopause,"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",9433353,IM,NA,NA,2015/09/19 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00 [entrez] 2015/09/19 06:00 [pubmed] 2016/12/15 06:00 [medline],10.1097/GME.0000000000000552 [doi],ppublish,Menopause. 2016 Mar;23(3):294-303. doi: 10.1097/GME.0000000000000552.,23,3,294-303,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20161213,0 (Gels) 4TI98Z838E (Estradiol),"Administration, Cutaneous Estradiol/pharmacology/*therapeutic use Female Gels Hot Flashes Humans Postmenopause/*drug effects Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Vasomotor System/*drug effects/physiopathology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One important application is an indirect comparison of a  new treatment with a placebo control on the basis of two separate randomized  clinical trials: a non-inferiority trial comparing the new treatment with an active  control and a historical trial comparing the active control with placebo. The  available methods for treatment effect calibration include an outcome regression  (OR) method based on a regression model for the outcome and a weighting method based  on a propensity score (PS) model. This article proposes new methods for treatment  effect calibration: one based on a conditional effect (CE) model and two doubly  robust (DR) methods. The first DR method involves a PS model and an OR model, is  asymptotically valid if either model is correct, and attains the semiparametric  information bound if both models are correct. The second DR method involves a PS  model, a CE model, and possibly an OR model, is asymptotically valid under the union  of the PS and CE models, and attains the semiparametric information bound if all  three models are correct. The various methods are compared in a simulation study and  applied to recent clinical trials for treating human immunodeficiency virus  infection.","© 2015, The International Biometric Society.","Zhang, Zhiwei Nie, Lei Soon, Guoxing Hu, Zonghui",Zhang Z Nie L Soon G Hu Z,NA,"Division of Biostatistics, Office of Surveillance and Biometrics, Center for Devices  and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland,  U.S.A.

We performed a network meta-analysis to assess the impact of different  combinations of B vitamins on risk of stroke. METHODS: A total of 17 trials (86 393  patients) comparing 7 treatment strategies and placebo were included. A network  meta-analysis combined all available direct and indirect treatment comparisons to  evaluate the efficacy of B vitamin supplementation for all interventions. RESULTS: B  vitamin supplementation was associated with reduced risk of stroke and cerebral  hemorrhage. The risk of stroke was lower with folic acid plus vitamin B6 as compared  with folic acid plus vitamin B12 and was lower with folic acid plus vitamin B6 plus  vitamin B12 as compared with placebo or folic acid plus vitamin B12. The treatments  ranked in order of efficacy for stroke, from higher to lower, were folic acid plus  vitamin B6 > folic acid > folic acid plus vitamin B6 plus vitamin B12 > vitamin B6  plus vitamin B12 > niacin > vitamin B6 > placebo > folic acid plus vitamin B12.  CONCLUSIONS: B vitamin supplementation was associated with reduced risk of stroke;  different B vitamins and their combined treatments had different efficacy on stroke  prevention.

We  estimated the comparative efficacy of antiviral drugs for prevention of vertical  transmission of HBV, through a network meta-analysis of clinical trials. METHODS: We  conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and published proceedings from  major liver meetings from January 1980 to November 2014. We conducted pair-wise  meta-analyses and Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods,  combining direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. RESULTS:  Seventeen clinical trials involving 2764 newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen  seropositive mothers were eligible for analysis. There were no clinical trials  involving tenofovir or entecavir. On pair-wise meta-analyses, telbivudine (hazard  ratio, HR 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.37; I(2)  = 0%), and Lamivudine  (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24-0.65; I(2)  = 0%), were more effective than placebo in  reducing vertical transmission of HBV in high viremic hepatitis B e antigen  (HBeAg)-positive chronic Hepatitis B Chinese patients. Sensitivity analyses limited  to studies with HBeAg seropositive mothers revealed similar results. CONCLUSIONS:  Based on a Bayesian network meta-analysis of clinical trials, combining direct and  indirect treatment comparisons, telbivudine appears to be more effective than  Lamivudine for preventing vertical transmission of HBV infection.

However, the efficiency of  postoperative chemotherapy without radiotherapy is unclear, especially in early  stage (stages I and II). We aimed to assess the effect of postoperative chemotherapy  without radiotherapy in early stage patients. METHODS: Databases and manual searches  were adopted to identify eligible randomized control trials. Hazard ratio (HR) was  used to assess the advantage of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival  (OS) by fixed or random-effects models. RESULTS: Fourteen trials with 3,923 patients  were included based on inclusion criteria. Compared with surgery alone,  postoperative chemotherapy significantly improved DFS and OS with HR of 0.71  (P=0.005) and 0.74 (P<0.00001), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed both  cisplatin-based (HR: 0.75, P<0.0001) and single tegafur-uracil (UFT) chemotherapy  (HR: 0.72, P=0.002) yielded significant survival benefits, but the latter did not  improve DFS (HR: 1.04, P=0.81). Indirect treatment comparison showed cisplatin-based  chemotherapy was superior to single UFT in DFS, but comparable in OS. The benefits  of postoperative chemotherapy were maintained in patients in stage I (HR: 0.74,  P<0.00001) and IB (HR: 0.74, P=0.0003), but not in stage IA, although the trend  supported chemotherapy (HR: 0.76, P=0.43). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis  demonstrates that postoperative chemotherapy without radiotherapy improves survival  of stage I-II, I, and IB non-small cell lung cancer patients, but not for IA.  Meanwhile, efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is comparable to single UFT in  OS, but better in DFS, which should be paid more attention in future clinical  practice.",NA,"Chen, Yuan-Yuan Wang, Lin-Wei Wang, Shu-Yi Wu, Bi-Bo Wang, Zhen-Meng Chen, Fang-Fang Xiong, Bin",Chen YY Wang LW Wang SY Wu BB Wang ZM Chen FF Xiong B,NA,"Department of Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Hubei Key Laboratory  of Tumor Biological Behaviors and Hubei Cancer Clinical Study Center, Wuhan, Hubei,  People's Republic of China.

Primary efficacy  outcomes were objective response rate, progression-free survival and overall  survival. Safety endpoints were grade 3/4 toxicities, serious adverse events and  withdrawals or deaths due to toxicity. Studies were selected if they were randomized  controlled trials reporting on the efficacy or safety of treatments for relapsed or  refractory follicular lymphoma, and if outcomes were reported separately from trials  that included other lymphoid neoplasms. We used the Bucher method for conducting  adjusted indirect comparisons within a meta-analysis. We identified 10 randomized  controlled trials of treatments for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. The  most prominent drug investigated (alone or in combination) was rituximab. Most  trials did not report median overall survival. Two trials reported median event-free  survival (range, 1.2-23.2 months). Six of ten trials reported objective response  rate (range, 9-93%). Meta-analysis showed only one statistically significant result:  rituximab + bortezomib yielded a significantly higher objective response rate than  rituximab monotherapy (relative risk, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.47).  Otherwise, there were no discernable differences in overall survival or  progression-free survival, partly due to insufficient reporting of results in the  clinical trials. The relatively small number of randomized controlled trials, few  overlapping treatment arms, and variability in the randomized controlled trial  features and in the endpoints studied complicate the formal comparison of therapies  for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma.

We generated hypothetical case studies for each category,  including questions about whether each might be allowable under Section 114. The  case studies were developed around the following categories: 1) costing out on-label  clinical end points; 2) promotion of a costing exercise to physicians working in an  accountable care organization setting; 3) burden-of-illness claims; 4) economic  analysis of a formulary restriction policy; 5) extrapolations to doses, populations,  or settings not covered in trials; 6) adherence claims; 7) ""utilization of care"" as  a secondary end point in randomized clinical trials; 8) costing out a competitor  drug's adverse event; 9) economic analysis of comparative effectiveness claims using  an indirect treatment comparison; and 10) extrapolating from surrogate to long-term  outcomes in an economic model. DISCUSSION: Most cases seem to fall into a gray zone  given haziness around what constitutes ""competent and reliable evidence"" and  ""directly relate[d]"" to an approved indication. In practice, it is difficult to know  what the section allows given the imprecision of the statute and lack of guidance  about its scope. CONCLUSION: Ideally, future guidance will provide clarity and  flexibility.",Copyright © 2015 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  (ISPOR). Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, to date no randomized  controlled trial (RCT) has directly compared intranasal midazolam with buccal  midazolam. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to indirectly compare intranasal  midazolam with buccal midazolam in the treatment of early SE using common  reference-based indirect comparison meta-analyses. METHODS: RCTs comparing  intranasal or buccal midazolam versus either intravenous or rectal diazepam for  early SE were systematically searched. Random-effects Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses  were performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for the efficacy and safety of intranasal  or buccal midazolam versus either intravenous or rectal diazepam. Adjusted indirect  comparisons were then made between intranasal and buccal midazolam using the  obtained results. RESULTS: Fifteen studies, with a total of 1662 seizures in 1331  patients (some studies included patients with more than one episode of SE) were  included; 1303 patients were younger than 16 years. Indirect comparisons showed no  difference between intranasal and buccal midazolam for seizure cessation (OR 0.98,  95% CI 0.32-3.01, comparator: intravenous diazepam; OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.46-1.64,  comparator: rectal diazepam). For serious adverse effects, we found a large width  and asymmetrical distribution of confidence intervals around the obtained OR of 2.81  (95% CI 0.39-20.12; comparator: rectal diazepam). No data were available for OR  using intravenous diazepam as the comparator. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons  suggest that intranasal and buccal midazolam share similar efficacy in the treatment  of early SE in children. Intranasal midazolam should be used with caution and under  clinical monitoring of vital functions. RCTs directly comparing intranasal midazolam  with buccal midazolam are required to confirm these findings.",NA,"Brigo, Francesco Nardone, Raffaele Tezzon, Frediano Trinka, Eugen",Brigo F Nardone R Tezzon F Trinka E,NA,"Section of Clinical Neurology, Department of Neurological and Movement Sciences,  University of Verona, Piazzale L.A.

However, it is  unclear whether statins as class or type (lipophilic or hydrophilic) improve  outcomes of established HF. AIMS: The current meta-analysis was performed to compare  the treatment effects of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins on inflammation and  cardiac function in HF. Outcomes were indicators of cardiac function [changes in  left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)] and  inflammation [changes in highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and  interluekin-6 (IL-6)]. METHOD: We conducted a search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the  Cochrane databases until December 31, 2014 for randomized control trials (RCTs) of  statin versus placebo in patients with HF. RCTs with their respective extracted  information were dichotomized into statin type evaluated and analyzed separately.  Outcomes were pooled with random effect approach, producing standardized mean  differences (SMD) for each statin type. Using these pooled estimates, we performed  adjusted indirect comparisons for each outcome. RESULTS: Data from 6214 patients  from 19 trials were analyzed. Lipophilic statin was superior to hydrophilic statin  treatment regarding follow-up LVEF (SMD, 4.54; 95% CI, 4.16-4.91; P < 0.001), BNP  (SMD, -1.60; 95% CI, -2.56 to -0.65; P < 0.001), hsCRP (SMD, -1.13; 95% CI, -1.54 to  -0.72; P < 0.001), and IL-6 (SMD, -3.75; 95% CI, -4.77 to -0.72; P < 0.001) in HF.  CONCLUSIONS: Lipophilic statin produces greater treatment effects on cardiac  function and inflammation compared with hydrophilic statin in patients with HF.  Until data from adequately powered head-to-head trial of the statin types are  available, our meta-analysis brings clinicians and researchers a step closer to the  quest on which statin--lipophilic or hydrophilic--is associated with better outcomes  in HF.",© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"Bonsu, Kwadwo Osei Reidpath, Daniel Diamond Kadirvelu, Amudha",Bonsu KO Reidpath DD Kadirvelu A,NA,"School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University, Bandar Sunway, Selangor  DE, Malaysia.

Through systematic  literature review, we identified nine randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) including  964 patients with biopsy-proven NASH, comparing vitamin E, thiazolidinediones  (TZDs), pentoxifylline, or obeticholic acid to one another or placebo. The primary  outcome was improvement in fibrosis stage; secondary outcomes were improvement in  ballooning degeneration, lobular inflammation, and steatosis. We reported relative  risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from direct meta-analysis and 95%  credible intervals (CrIs) from Bayesian network meta-analysis, and used Grading of  Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise  quality of evidence. Moderate-quality evidence supports the use of pentoxifylline  (RR, 0.26; 95% CrI: 0.05-1.00) and obeticholic acid (RR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70-0.95)  over placebo in improving fibrosis. High-quality evidence supports the effect of  vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic acid over placebo in improving ballooning  degeneration. All four interventions seemed to have at least moderate-quality  evidence over placebo to improve steatosis. Moderate-quality evidence supports that  TZDs, pentoxifylline, and obeticholic acid decrease lobular inflammation. All the  head-to-head comparisons were supported by very-low-quality evidence except for  superiority of TZDs over vitamin E on improving steatosis and lobular inflammation,  which had moderate-quality evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Based on direct and network  meta-analysis, pentoxifylline and obeticholic acid improve fibrosis, and vitamin E,  TZDs, and obeticholic acid improve ballooning degeneration in patients with NASH.

This study evaluatedthe  cost-utility of certolizumab pegol versusTNF-inhibitors plus methotrexate in the  treatment of moderate-to-severe RA in Spain. METHODS: A Markov cohort health state  transition model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility (costs and  quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of certolizumab pegol versus other  TNF-inhibitors licensed in Spain in 2009. Efficacy was measured using the American  College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses at 6 months, based on adjusted indirect  comparisons from published clinical trials. Utilities were derived from EQ-5D data  from certolizumab pegol RA clinical trials. Clinical history and resource use data  came from published literature. Unit costs were taken from Spanish databases or  published data (cost year 2009). Base case analyses were conducted from the payer  perspective, with a lifetime horizon, 3.5 % annual discounting rates for costs and  outcomes, and 3 % inflation rate for 2009 onwards. One-way sensitivity analyses were  conducted. RESULTS: The average lifetime costs for certolizumab pegol, etanercept,  adalimumab (every 2 weeks and weekly) and infliximab (3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) in  combination with methotrexate were €140,971, €141,197, €139,148, €164,741, €136,961  and €152,561, respectively. The QALYs gained were 6.578, 6.462, 6.430 (for both  adalimumab doses), 6.430, and 6.318 (for both infliximab doses), respectively. At a  €30,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, certolizumab pegol plus methotrexate  dominated adalimumab weekly, etanercept, and infliximab 5 mg/kg, and was  cost-effective versus adalimumab every 2 weeks and infliximab 3 mg/kg (all with  methotrexate), with estimated ICERs of €12,346/QALY and €15,414/QALY, respectively.  Certolizumab pegol monotherapy was more cost-effective versus adalimumab, and less  expensive with similar health gains versus etanercept (6.416 QALYs vs 6.492).  Univariate analysis showed ICERs to be sensitive to changes in time horizon, ACR  response time point, baseline Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, and rate  of HAQ-disability index deterioration after discontinuing treatment.

In  previous work with generic tuberculosis medicines prequalified by the WHO, it was  observed that although indirect comparisons are an effective approach for confirming  the interchangeability of generics, the approach is subject to less precision than  direct comparisons. The objective of this investigation was to explore this by  examining the influence of point estimates and power of bioequivalence studies  versus the reference on the ability to show equivalence in indirect comparisons.  METHODS: Power was considered as a determining factor instead of variability and  sample size, because sample size is calculated based on variability and desired  power. Scenarios were computed combining a range of point estimate differences (0-14  %) and statistical power of the studies (50-99.99 %). RESULTS: The indirect  comparisons could conclude equivalence between generics only when (a) point estimate  differences between generics were low (≤ 5.5 %) for any sufficiently powered study  (> 80 %), or (b) the differences were large (but less than 14 %) and both  bioequivalence studies were overpowered (e.g., 10 % difference and power ≥ 95 %).  CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the ability to demonstrate interchangeability between  generics is dependent not only on the real differences between the products but also  on the design of the original generic vs. reference bioequivalence studies being  combined, as earmarked by their respective power.",NA,"Gwaza, Luther Gordon, John Potthast, Henrike Welink, Jan Leufkens, Hubert Stahl, Matthias García-Arieta, Alfredo",Gwaza L Gordon J Potthast H Welink J Leufkens H Stahl M García-Arieta A,NA,"Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Utrecht, The Netherlands.",eng,NA,Comparative Study Journal Article,20150624,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,IM,NA,NA,2015/06/25 06:00,2016/05/18 06:00,2015/06/25 06:00,2014/12/22 00:00 [received] 2015/06/09 00:00 [accepted] 2015/06/25 06:00 [entrez] 2015/06/25 06:00 [pubmed] 2016/05/18 06:00 [medline],10.1007/s00228-015-1889-9 [doi],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2015 Sep;71(9):1083-9. doi: 10.1007/s00228-015-1889-9.

Joint  synthesis can improve efficiency over separate univariate syntheses, may reduce  selective outcome reporting biases, and enables joint inferences across the  outcomes. A common issue is that within-study correlations needed to fit the  multivariate model are unknown from published reports. However, provision of  individual participant data (IPD) allows them to be calculated directly. Here, we  illustrate how to use IPD to estimate within-study correlations, using a joint  linear regression for multiple continuous outcomes and bootstrapping methods for  binary, survival and mixed outcomes. In a meta-analysis of 10 hypertension trials,  we then show how these methods enable multivariate meta-analysis to address novel  clinical questions about continuous, survival and binary outcomes;  treatment-covariate interactions; adjusted risk/prognostic factor effects;  longitudinal data; prognostic and multiparameter models; and multiple treatment  comparisons. Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches are applied, with example  software code provided to derive within-study correlations and to fit the models.","© 2014 The Authors.

We assessed  the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for severe AH,  through a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons.  METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review, through February 2015, for  randomized controlled trials of adults with severe AH (discriminant function ≥32  and/or hepatic encephalopathy) that compared the efficacy of active pharmacologic  interventions (corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, and N-acetylcysteine [NAC], alone or  in combination) with each other or placebo, in reducing short-term mortality  (primary outcome) and medium-term mortality, acute kidney injury, and/or infections  (secondary outcomes). We performed direct and Bayesian network meta-analysis for all  treatments, and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and  Evaluation criteria to appraise quality of evidence. RESULTS: We included 22  randomized controlled trials (2621 patients) comparing 5 different interventions. In  a direct meta-analysis, only corticosteroids decreased risk of short-term mortality.  In a network meta-analysis, moderate quality evidence supported the use of  corticosteroids alone (relative risk [RR], 0.54; 95% credible interval [CrI],  0.39-0.73) or in combination with pentoxifylline (RR, 0.53; 95% CrI, 0.36-0.78) or  NAC (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.39), to reduce short-term mortality; low quality  evidence showed that pentoxifylline also decreased short-term mortality (RR, 0.70;  95% CrI, 0.50-0.97). The addition of NAC, but not pentoxifylline, to corticosteroids  may be superior to corticosteroids alone for reducing short-term mortality. No  treatment was effective in reducing medium-term mortality. Imprecise estimates and  the small number of direct trials lowered the confidence in several comparisons.  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe AH, pentoxifylline and corticosteroids (alone  and in combination with pentoxifylline or NAC) can reduce short-term mortality. No  treatment decreases risk of medium-term mortality.",Copyright © 2015 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to investigate  generic-generic drug interchangeability in a large subset of generic formulations in  order to cover a broad spectrum of drugs. METHODS: Orally administered drugs for  investigation in this study were selected using strict, predefined criteria, with  the purpose to avoid bias. This selection procedure yielded atorvastatin,  bicalutamide, naratriptan, olanzapine, perindopril, and venlafaxine. Further,  ciclosporin, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil were investigated as test  immunosuppressants. Adjusted indirect comparisons were conducted between generic  drugs containing the same active substance, and the 90% confidence interval (CI) for  AUC and Cmax was calculated. RESULTS: In total, 120 bioequivalence studies were  identified in the Dutch medicine regulatory agency's database, allowing 292 indirect  comparisons between generic drugs. The indirect comparison results indicated that in  the vast majority of cases, i.e., 80.5%, the 90% CIs for both AUCt and Cmax fell  within the bioequivalence criteria (in 90.1 and 87.0% for AUCt and Cmax,  respectively). In 1% of the 292 indirect comparison for AUCt and 3% for Cmax, a  wider range of 75-133% (or 80-125%) was exceeded.

Lurasidone and quetiapine extended-release (XR) are atypical antipsychotic agents  indicated for monotherapy treatment of bipolar depression. Lurasidone is also  indicated as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for depressive episodes  associated with bipolar disorder. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the  cost-effectiveness of lurasidone and quetiapine XR in patients with bipolar  depression. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare lurasidone  to quetiapine XR. The model was based on a US third-party payer perspective over a  3-month time horizon. The effectiveness measure in the model was the percentage of  patients achieving remission (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]  total score ≤12 by weeks 6-8). The comparison of remission rates was made through an  adjusted indirect treatment comparison of lurasidone and quetiapine XR pivotal  trials using placebo as the common comparator. Resource utilization for remission vs  no remission was estimated from published expert panel data, and resource costs were  obtained from a retrospective database study of bipolar I depression patients. Drug  costs were estimated using the mean dose from clinical trials and wholesale  acquisition costs. RESULTS: Over the 3-month model time period, lurasidone and  quetiapine XR patients, respectively, had similar mean numbers of emergency  department visits (0.48 vs 0.50), inpatient days (2.1 vs 2.2), and office visits  (9.3 vs 9.6). More lurasidone than quetiapine XR patients achieved remission (52.0%  vs 43.2%) with slightly higher total costs ($4982 vs $4676), resulting in an  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3474 per remission.

However, little information exists  comparing it with acarbose which is also commonly used in China. This study expanded  knowledge by combining direct and indirect evidence to ascertain the glucose  lowering effects of both drugs. METHODS: PubMed (1980- December 2013) and China  National Knowledge Infrastructure databases (1994-January 2014) were systematically  searched for eligible randomized controlled trials from Chinese and English  literatures. Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the glucose lowering effects of  metformin vs. acarbose, or either of them vs. common comparators (placebo or  sulphonylureas), using random- and fixed-effect models. Bucher method with indirect  treatment comparison calculator was applied to convert the summary estimates from  the meta-analyses into weighted-mean-difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals  (CIs) to represent the comparative efficacy between metformin and acarbose. RESULTS:  A total of 75 studies were included in the analysis. In direct comparison (8  trials), metformin reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.06% more than  acarbose, with no significant difference (WMD,-0.06%; 95% CI, -0.32% to 0.20%). In  indirect comparisons (67 trials), by using placebo and sulphonylureas as common  comparators, metformin achieved significant HbA1c reduction than acarbose, by -0.38%  (WMD,-0.38%, 95% CI, -0.736% to -0.024%) and -0.34% (WMD, -0.34%, 95% CI, -0.651% to  -0.029%) respectively. CONCLUSION: The glucose lowering effects of metformin  monotherapy and acarbose monotherapy are the same by direct comparison, while  metformin is a little better by indirect comparison. This implies that the effect of  metformin is at least as good as acarbose's.",NA,"Gu, Shuyan Shi, Jihao Tang, Zhiliu Sawhney, Monika Hu, Huimei Shi, Lizheng Fonseca, Vivian Dong, Hengjin",Gu S Shi J Tang Z Sawhney M Hu H Shi L Fonseca V Dong H,NA,"Center for Health Policy Studies, School of Public Health, Zhejiang University  School of Medicine, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China.

Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows for the comparison of multiple treatments in a  comprehensive analysis and the determination of the best treatment among several  competing treatments, including those that have never been compared in a  head-to-head study. Including IPD in NMA may enable the prevention of misleading  inferences due to several biases, such as aggregation bias. Application of IPD-NMA  methods in healthcare have begun to appear in medical journals. Our objective is to  conduct a scoping review of existing IPD-NMA methods, and summarise their  properties. We also aim to describe the characteristics of empirical IPD-NMAs, and  examine how their results are reported. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search  relevant electronic databases from inception until October 2014 (eg, MEDLINE), grey  literature, and Google. The scoping review will consider published and unpublished  papers that report completion of an IPD-NMA, describe a method, or report the  methodological quality of IPD-NMA. We will include IPD-NMA of any quantitative study  (eg, experimental, quasiexperimental, observational studies). Two reviewers will  independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles, and will complete  data abstraction. The anticipated outcome will be a collection of all the IPD-NMAs  completed to date, and a description of their methods and reporting of results. We  will create summary tables providing the characteristics of the included studies,  and the various methods. Quantitative data (eg, number of patients) will be  summarised by medians and IQRs, and categorical data (eg, type of effect size) by  frequencies and percentages. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not  required as our study will not include confidential participant data and  interventions.

In this paper, we  propose a Bayesian IPD NMA modeling framework for multiple continuous outcomes under  both contrast-based and arm-based parameterizations.

The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation  Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence  Review Group (ERG). This article summarizes the ERG's review of the evidence  submitted by the company and provides a summary of the Appraisal Committee's (AC)  final decision in October 2014. The clinical evidence for dabrafenib was derived  from an ongoing phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,  international, multicentre clinical trial (BREAK-3) involving 230 patients  randomized 2:1 to receive either dabrafenib or dacarbazine. A significant  improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS)  was reported in the dabrafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. Vemurafenib is  considered a more appropriate comparator than is dacarbazine. The clinical evidence  for vemurafenib was derived from a completed phase III, randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BRIM-3) involving 675  patients randomized 1:1 to receive either vemurafenib or dacarbazine. A significant  improvement in median PFS and OS was reported in the vemurafenib arm compared with  dacarbazine. As there is no direct evidence comparing dabrafenib versus vemurafenib,  the company presented an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) that demonstrated no  statistical differences between dabrafenib and vemurafenib for PFS or OS. The ERG  expressed concerns with the ITC, mainly in relation to the validity of the  assumptions underpinning the methodology; the ERG concluded this resulted in  findings that are unlikely to be robust or reliable. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are  both available to patients treated by the National Health Service (NHS) in England  via a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) in which the costs of the drugs are discounted.  Using these discounted costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs)  generated by the company were £60,980 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for  dabrafenib versus dacarbazine and £11,046 per QALY gained for dabrafenib versus  vemurafenib. The ERG considered the economic model structure developed by the  company to derive the ICERs to be overly complex and based on unsubstantiated  assumptions, most importantly in relation to the projection of OS. Applying the  latest OS data from BREAK-3 to a less complex model structure increased the  estimated ICER for dabrafenib compared with dacarbazine from £60,980 to £112,727 per  QALY gained. Since the results from the ITC were considered by the ERG to be neither  reliable nor robust, the ERG also considered a cost-effectiveness comparison to be  inappropriate due to a lack of meaningful or reliable data. In spite of limitations  in the data, the AC took the view that dabrafenib and vemurafenib were ""likely"" of  similar clinical effectiveness. Since the overall costs of these two drugs were  similar, the AC recommended the use of dabrafenib in patients with unresectable,  advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.",NA,"Fleeman, Nigel Bagust, Adrian Beale, Sophie Boland, Angela Dickson, Rumona Dwan, Kerry Richardson, Marty Dundar, Yenal Davis, Helen Banks, Lindsay",Fleeman N Bagust A Beale S Boland A Dickson R Dwan K Richardson M Dundar Y Davis H Banks L,NA,"Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group, University of Liverpool, Whelan  Building, Liverpool, L69 3GB, UK, Nigel.Fleeman@liverpool.ac.uk.",eng,NA,"Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review",NA,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,NA,NA,NA,2015/04/24 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00 [entrez] 2015/04/24 06:00 [pubmed] 2016/12/15 06:00 [medline],10.1007/s40273-015-0276-9 [doi],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2015 Sep;33(9):893-904. doi: 10.1007/s40273-015-0276-9.,33,9,893-904,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20161213,"0 (Antineoplastic Agents) 0 (Imidazoles) 0 (Oximes) EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human) EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf) QGP4HA4G1B (dabrafenib)","Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*economics/therapeutic use Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic Cost-Benefit Analysis Disease-Free Survival Humans Imidazoles/administration & dosage/*economics/therapeutic use Melanoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*secondary *Models, Economic Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Metastasis Oximes/administration & dosage/*economics/therapeutic use Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is sometimes not possible to  perform treatment comparisons as evidence networks restricted to randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) may be disconnected. We propose a Bayesian NMA model that  allows to include single-arm, before-and-after, observational studies to complete  these disconnected networks. We illustrate the method with an indirect comparison of  treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). METHODS: Our method uses a  random effects model for placebo improvements to include single-arm observational  studies into a general NMA. Building on recent research for binary outcomes, we  develop a covariate-adjusted continuous-outcome NMA model that combines individual  patient data (IPD) and aggregate data from two-arm RCTs with the single-arm  observational studies. We apply this model to a complex comparison of therapies for  PAH combining IPD from a phase-III RCT of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH and  aggregate data from RCTs and single-arm observational studies, both identified by a  systematic review. RESULTS: Through the inclusion of observational studies, our  method allowed the comparison of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH with other  treatments. This comparison had not been previously possible due to the limited RCT  evidence available. However, the credible intervals of our posterior estimates were  wide so the overall results were inconclusive. The comparison should be treated as  exploratory and should not be used to guide clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Our  method for the inclusion of single-arm observational studies allows the performance  of indirect comparisons that had previously not been possible due to incomplete  networks composed solely of available RCTs. We also built on many recent innovations  to enable researchers to use both aggregate data and IPD. This method could be used  in similar situations where treatment comparisons have not been possible due to  restrictions to RCT evidence and where a mixture of aggregate data and IPD are  available.",NA,"Thom, Howard H Z Capkun, Gorana Cerulli, Annamaria Nixon, Richard M Howard, Luke S",Thom HH Capkun G Cerulli A Nixon RM Howard LS,NA,"School of Social and Community Medicine, Bristol, UK. howard.thom@bristol.ac.uk.

METHODS: An exhaustive  search was performed until October 2013. Databases consulted were MEDLINE, EMBASE,  the Cochrane Library, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Web of  Science. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of infliximab,  adalimumab or golimumab versus placebo, in terms of clinical remission, clinical  response and mucosal healing, were included. In the case that more than one RCT  fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the same drug, a metanalysis was undertaken  using a fixed effects model. ITCs were carried out using the method proposed by  Bucher et al. RESULTS: 6 RCTs published in 5 papers were included: 2 for infliximab  (ACT 1 and ACT 2), 2 for adalimumab (ULTRA 1 y ULTRA 2) and 2 for golimumab  (PURSUIT-SC y PURSUIT-M).In these RTCs, each biological agent was superior in  efficacy to placebo. The results of the adjusted ITC are the following. In relation  to the clinical remission, in the induction and maintenance period, there are no  statistically significant differences between the three anti-TNF drugs. In relation  to the clinical response and mucosal healing, in the induction period, there are  statistically significant differences between infliximab and adalimumab. CONCLUSION:  In view of the results obtained, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab appear to be  similarly effective therapeutic alternatives. Therefore, other considerations such  as safety, tolerance and cost-effectiveness should be taken into account in order to  select the most appropriate treatment.",Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

These effects must therefore be derived from indirect  comparisons of results from different studies. The feasibility of comparisons relies  on the network linking treatments through common comparators; the reliability of  these may also be impacted when the studies are heterogeneous or when multiple  intermediate comparisons are needed to link two specific treatments of interest.  Simulated treatment comparison and matching-adjusted indirect comparison have been  developed to address these challenges. These focus on comparisons of outcomes for  two specific treatments of interest by using patient-level data for one treatment  (the index) and published results for the other treatment (the comparator) from  compatible studies, taking into account possible confounding due to population  differences.

METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to  identify the relevant NMAs using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Database of  Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Health Technology Assessment. The synthesis  studies were evaluated using the ""Questionnaire to assess the relevance and  credibility of the NMA."" RESULTS: Eleven NMAs evaluating NOACs among adults with  nonvalvular AF were identified. Most NMAs included three large phase III randomized  controlled trials, comparing NOACs to adjusted-dose warfarin (Randomized Evaluation  of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy [RE-LY], Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct  Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and  Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation [ROCKET-AF], and Apixaban for Reduction of  Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE]). The main  differences identified related to potential treatment effect modifiers regarding the  mean time spent in therapeutic range (TTR) in the warfarin arm, the risk of stroke  or systemic embolism across the trials (mean CHADS2 score: C = congestive heart  failure, H = hypertension, A = older than age 75 years, D = diabetes mellitus, S2 =  prior stroke or history of transient ischemic attack) or primary versus secondary  prevention, and type of populations used in the analysis.

Meta-regressions are not expected to minimize confounding bias given  limited data, whereas subgroup analyses had some impact on the point estimates for  the treatment comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the synthesis studies were  generally comparable and suggested that the NOACs had similar efficacy, although  some differences were identified depending on the outcome.

The purpose of this study was to conduct an integrated  database analysis of patient level data to compare the effects of duloxetine with  those of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at the doses approved in  Japan. METHODS: Pooled data were analyzed from four randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled studies that compared duloxetine at the dose range approved in  Japan (40-60 mg/day) with other SSRIs (paroxetine 20 mg/day or escitalopram 10  mg/day) and placebo in patients with major depressive disorder. In total, 1,694  patients were included in the analysis (duloxetine, n=688; selective serotonin  reuptake inhibitors, n=690; placebo, n=316). The primary outcome measure was the  mean change from baseline at week 8 in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression  (HAMD17) total and subscale scores. RESULTS: Duloxetine and both selective serotonin  reuptake inhibitors were superior to placebo in HAMD17 total score at week 8 in both  the all-randomized group and the more severe subgroup (HAMD17 total scores ≥19).  Duloxetine was superior to SSRIs in improving the HAMD17 Retardation subscale score  (least squares mean difference [95% confidence interval]): all-randomized group,  -0.33 [-0.60, -0.07], P=0.015; severe subgroup, -0.45 [-0.83, -0.07], P=0.020).  CONCLUSION: Within the dose range approved in Japan for patients with major  depressive disorder, duloxetine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  demonstrated comparable overall efficacy, with a possible advantage for duloxetine  in improving loss of energy and interest. To the best of our knowledge, this  analysis is unique not only in evaluating dosages specific to Japan, but also in  using individual patient data and the same endpoint across studies to allow for  strictly direct head-to-head data comparisons as opposed to pooling direct and  indirect comparisons.",NA,"Harada, Eiji Schacht, Alexander Koyama, Tsukasa Marangell, Lauren B Tsuji, Toshinaga Escobar, Rodrigo",Harada E Schacht A Koyama T Marangell LB Tsuji T Escobar R,NA,"Medical Science, Eli Lilly Japan K.K, Kobe, Japan.

Novel  tools have been developed building upon the historical approach of reviewing the  literature focusing on a specific topic. Stemming from qualitative reviews,  systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials, typically encompassing statistical  pooling with pairwise meta-analysis, have been devised and are now considered one of  the uppermost ladders in the hierarchy of clinical evidence. In the last decade, the  exponential growth in randomized trials and the introduction of original  computational methods have created the novel opportunity to compare indirectly  competing treatments, as well as combining effect estimates stemming from  head-to-head trials with those obtained by indirect comparisons. These methods  include adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, and mixed  treatment comparison. While still the focus of intense research and debate, they  represent a powerful tool for evidence synthesis and comparative effectiveness in  cardiovascular research, and thus are likely to become increasingly popular and  impactful in shaping research agenda and clinical practice.

Well-established drug class efficacies have become commonplace in many disease  areas. Thus, for reasons of ethics and equipoise, it is not practical to randomize  patients to placebo or older drug classes. Unique randomized clinical trial designs  are an attempt to navigate these obstacles. These alternative designs, however, pose  challenges when attempting to incorporate data into NMAs. Using ulcerative colitis  as an example, we illustrate an example of a method where data provided by these  trials are used to populate treatment networks. METHODS: We present the methods used  to convert data from the PURSUIT trial into a typical parallel design for inclusion  in our NMA. Data were required for three arms: golimumab 100 mg; golimumab 50 mg;  and placebo. Golimumab 100 mg induction data were available; however, data regarding  those individuals who were nonresponders at induction and those who were responders  at maintenance were not reported, and as such, had to be imputed using data from the  rerandomization phase. Golimumab 50 mg data regarding responses at week 6 were not  available. Existing relationships between the available components were used to  impute the expected proportions in this missing subpopulation. Data for placebo  maintenance response were incomplete, as all induction nonresponders were assigned  to golimumab 100 mg. Data from the PURSUIT trial were combined with ACT-1 and  ULTRA-2 trial data to impute missing information. DISCUSSION: We have demonstrated  methods for converting results from alternative study designs to more conventional  parallel randomized clinical trials. These conversions allow for indirect treatment  comparisons that are informed by a wider array of evidence, adding to the precision  of estimates.",NA,"Thorlund, Kristian Druyts, Eric Toor, Kabirraaj Jansen, Jeroen P Mills, Edward J",Thorlund K Druyts E Toor K Jansen JP Mills EJ,NA,"Redwood Outcomes, Vancouver, BC, Canada ; Department of Clinical Epidemiology and  Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada ; Stanford Prevention  Research Center, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.

In phase II/III randomized  controlled trials (RCT) conducted in Japan, SMV, in combination with peginterferon-α  and ribavirin (PEG IFN/RBV), demonstrated potent efficacy in HCV genotype 1-infected  patients relative to PEG IFN/RBV and was generally well tolerated. Telaprevir (TVR)  in combination with PEG IFN/RBV is licensed for the treatment of HCV in Japan. In  the absence of head-to-head comparisons of TVR and SMV in a Japanese population, we  undertook a network meta-analysis (NMA) to examine the relative efficacy and safety  of SMV and TVR in combination with PEG IFN/RBV. METHODS: A systematic review  identified SMV and TVR RCT in Japanese treatment-naïve patients. Bayesian NMA was  performed assuming fixed study effects. RESULTS: Three studies met our inclusion  criteria: two SMV and one TVR. SMV showed a higher mean odds ratio (OR) of achieving  SVR versus TVR (OR, 1.68 (95% credible interval 0.66-4.26)). SMV showed a lower mean  OR of discontinuation: overall, 0.35 (0.12-1.00); and due to AE, 0.87 (0.23-3.34)  versus TVR. SMV showed a lower mean OR of experiencing anemia 0.20 (0.07-0.56) and  rash 0.41 (0.17-0.99) but a higher mean OR of experiencing pruritus 1.26 (0.46-3.47)  versus TVR.

METHODS:  Direct and adjusted indirect comparisons of all the recent randomized control trials  (RCTs) were performed to evaluate the safety of short-term versus long-term DAPT  following DES. RESULTS: 8 RCTs were identified and 7 (16,318 subjects) were  included. 4 groups of 3 vs 12 months, 6 vs 12 months, 6 vs 24 months and 12 vs 24  months of DAPT were used for direct comparison. There was no significant difference  in stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and revascularization,  cardiovascular and all-cause mortality between the different durations in all 4  groups. Pooling trials of 3-6 months of DAPT against 12 months, we found a  significant reduction in the risk of total bleeding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.87).  Adjusted indirect comparison between 3 vs 6 months, 3 vs 24 months and 6 vs 24 month  duration of DAPT showed no significant differences in risk of death or MI, or  revascularization between 3 or 6 months and 24 months. However, 24months of DAPT was  associated with significantly more bleeding than 3 or 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: 3 to 6  months of DAPT following second generation DES and above is safe with no increased  risk of thrombotic complications and mortality, and lower bleeding risk. However a  tailored approach may be more appropriate for high-risk patients.",Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this systematic review  is to answer the clinical question, whether conventional high-viscosity  glass-ionomer restorations, in patients with single and/or multi-surface cavities in  posterior permanent teeth, have indeed a higher failure rate than direct hybrid  resin composite restorations. METHODS: Eight databases were searched until December  02, 2013. Trials were assessed for bias risks, in-between datasets heterogeneity and  statistical sample size power. Effects sizes were computed and statistically  compared. A total of 55 citations were identified through systematic literature  search. From these, 46 were excluded. No trials related to high-viscosity  glass-ionomers versus resin composite restorations for direct head-to-head  comparison were found. Three trials related to high-viscosity glass-ionomers versus  amalgam and three trials related to resin composite versus amalgam restorations  could be included for adjusted indirect comparison, only. RESULTS: The available  evidence suggests no difference in the failure rates between both types of  restoration beyond the play of chance, is limited by lack of head-to-head  comparisons and an insufficient number of trials, as well as by high bias and  in-between-dataset heterogeneity risk. The current clinical evidence needs to be  regarded as too poor in order to justify superiority claims regarding the failure  rates of both restoration types. Sufficiently large-sized, parallel-group,  randomised control trials with high internal validity are needed, in order to  justify any clinically meaningful judgment to this topic.",NA,"Mickenautsch, Steffen Yengopal, Veerasamy",Mickenautsch S Yengopal V,NA,"SYSTEM Initiative/Department of Community Dentistry, Faculty of Health Sciences,  University of the Witwatersrand - 7 York Rd., Parktown/Johannesburg 2193, South  Africa.

There are as many as 20 million cases of sepsis annually  worldwide, with a mortality rate of around 35%. It has been reported that the  dysregulation of haemostatic system due to the interaction between coagulation  system and inflammatory response is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with  severe sepsis. In this context, several anticoagulants have been evaluated in recent  years. However, the results of these studies were inconsistent and even  contradictory. In addition, there is insufficient evidence comparing the efficacy  and safety of different anticoagulants. The purpose of our study is to carry out a  systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of  different anticoagulants for severe sepsis based on existing randomised controlled  trials (RCTs) and ranking these anticoagulants for practical consideration. METHODS  AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases will be systematically  searched for eligible studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) on anticoagulant  therapy for severe sepsis with multiple outcome measures will be included. The  Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool will be used to assess the quality of included studies.  The primary outcomes are mortality and bleeding events. The secondary outcomes  include the length of intensive care stay, the length of hospital stay and duration  of mechanical ventilation. Direct pairwise meta-analysis (DMA), indirect treatment  comparison meta-analysis (ITC) and network meta-analysis (NMA) will be conducted to  compare different anticoagulants. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not  required given that this is a protocol for a systematic review. The protocol of this  systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at a  relevant conference.

METHODS:  We built a new score named total incremental net benefit (TINB), with inverse  variance weighting of incremental net benefits (INB). This permits determination of  whether an alternative is cost-effective, given a specific threshold (TINB > 0  test). Before validation of the model, the structure of dependence between costs and  quality-adjusted life years (QoL) was analysed using copula distributions. The  goodness-of-fit of a Spanish prospective observational study (n = 498) was analysed  using the Independent, Gaussian, T, Gumbel, Clayton, Frank and Placket copulas.  Validation was carried out by simulating a copula distribution with log-normal  distribution for costs and gamma distribution for disutilities. Hypothetical cohorts  were created by varying the sample size (n: 15-500) and assuming three scenarios  (1-cost-effective; 2-non-cost-effective; 3-dominant). The COMER result was compared  to the theoretical result according to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio  (ICER) and the INB, assuming a margin of error of 2,000 and 500 monetary units,  respectively. RESULTS: The Frank copula with positive dependence (-0.4279) showed a  goodness-of-fit sufficient to represent costs and QoL (p-values 0.524 and 0.808).  The theoretical INB was within the 95% confidence interval of the TINB, based on 15  individuals with a probability > 80% for scenarios 1 and 2, and > 90% for scenario  3. The TINB > 0 test with 15 individuals showed p-values of 0.0105 (SD: 0.0411) for  scenario 1, 0.613 (SD: 0.265) for scenario 2 and < 0.0001 for scenario 3.

Paracetamol is often the first  line analgesic recommended, without consensus about which is the better analgesic.  METHODS: An overview review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses directly  compares ibuprofen and paracetamol at standard doses in particular painful  conditions, or uses indirect comparisons against placebo. Electronic searches for  systematic reviews were sought published since 1995 using outcomes approximating to  ≥50% pain intensity reduction. Painful conditions were acute post-operative pain,  dysmenorrhoea, tension-type headache (TTH), migraine, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid  arthritis, back pain, cancer and paediatric pain. There was no systematic assessment  of harm. RESULTS: Sixteen systematic reviews and four individual patient data  meta-analyses were included. Ibuprofen was consistently superior to paracetamol at  conventional doses in a range of painful conditions. Two direct comparisons favoured  ibuprofen (acute pain, osteoarthritis). Three of four indirect comparisons favoured  ibuprofen (acute pain, migraine, osteoarthritis); one showed no difference (TTH),  although there were methodological problems. In five pain conditions (dysmenorrhoea,  paediatric pain, cancer pain, back pain and rheumatoid arthritis), there were  limited data on paracetamol and ibuprofen. CONCLUSIONS: At standard doses in  different painful conditions, ibuprofen was usually superior producing more patients  with the degree of pain relief that patients feel worthwhile. Neither of the drugs  will be effective for everyone, and both are needed. This overview questions the  practice of routinely using paracetamol as a first line analgesic because there is  no good evidence for efficacy of paracetamol in many pain conditions.",© 2014 The Authors.

In this study, a systematic literature search was  performed to capture survival and postoperative morbidity and mortality data in  randomised clinical studies comparing preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy or  chemotherapy versus surgery alone, or preoperative chemoradiotherapy versus  chemotherapy for gastric and/or gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) cancer. Hazard  ratios (HRs) for overall mortality were extracted from the original studies,  individual patient data provided from the principal investigators of eligible  studies or the earlier published meta-analysis. The incidences of postoperative  morbidities and mortalities were also analysed. In total 18 studies were eligible  and data were available from 14 of these. The meta-analysis on overall survival  yielded HRs of 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.86, P < 0.001) for preoperative  (chemo)radiotherapy and 0.83 (95% CI 0.67-1.01, P = 0.065) for preoperative  chemotherapy when compared to surgery alone. Direct comparison between preoperative  chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy resulted in an HR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.45-1.12, P =  0.146). Combination of direct and adjusted indirect comparisons yielded an HR of  0.86 (95% CI 0.69-1.07, P = 0.171). No statistically significant differences were  seen in the risk for postoperative morbidity or mortality between preoperative  treatments and surgery alone, or preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and chemotherapy.  Preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy for gastric and GOJ cancer showed significant  survival benefit over surgery alone. In comparisons between preoperative  chemotherapy and (chemo)radiotherapy, there is a trend towards improved survival  when adding radiotherapy, without increased postoperative morbidity or mortality.",Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We  investigated whether using individual patient data (IPD) can adjust for this form of  bias. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We included IPD of 3 ovarian reserve tests from 32  studies. Inconsistency was defined as a statistically significant difference in  relative accuracy or different comparative results between the direct and indirect  evidence. We adjusted for the effect of threshold and reference standard, as well as  for patient-specific variables. RESULTS: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle  stimulation hormone (FSH) differed significantly in sensitivity (-0.1563, P = 0.04).  AMH and antral follicle count (AFC) differed significantly in sensitivity (0.1465, P  < 0.01). AMH and AFC differed significantly in specificity (-0.0607, P = 0.02). The  area under the curve (AUC) differed significantly between AFC and FSH (0.0948, P <  0.01) in the direct comparison but not (0.0678, P = 0.09) in the indirect  comparison. The AUCs of AFC and AMH differed significantly (-0.0830, P < 0.01) in  the indirect comparison but not (-0.0176, P = 0.29) in the direct comparison. These  differences remained after adjusting for indirectness. CONCLUSION: Estimates of  comparative accuracy obtained through indirect comparisons are not always consistent  with those obtained through direct comparisons.

We systematically searched databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and  Embase; 1997 to August 2, 2012), conference abstracts, bibliographic reference  lists, recent reviews, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Primary efficacy outcomes were  objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Safety end  points were Grade 3/4 toxicities, serious adverse events, withdrawals because of  toxicity, and deaths due to toxicity. Studies were selected if they were randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of relapsed or  refractory CLL and if outcomes for CLL were reported separately from trials that  included other lymphoid neoplasms. We used the Bucher method for conducting adjusted  indirect comparisons within a meta-analysis. We identified 6 RCTs of pharmacologic  treatment for relapsed/refractory CLL. The most common drugs investigated (alone or  in combination) were fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. When reported, median overall  survival ranged from 27.3 to 52.9 months, and overall response rate from 58% to 82%.  Although meta-analysis of efficacy results was considered, details are not presented  because only 3 studies qualified and the common comparator treatment was not  clinically relevant. The relatively small number of RCTs, few overlapping treatment  arms, and variability in end points studied make it difficult to formally compare  therapies for relapsed/refractory CLL. Significant variability in RCT features  presents a further challenge to meaningful comparisons. Additional well-designed  RCTs are needed to fully understand the relative efficacy and safety of older and  more recently developed therapies.",Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study examines the relative  cost-effectiveness of dabigatran (BID dosing of 150 mg or 110 mg based on patient  age), rivaroxaban, and apixaban from a UK payer perspective. METHODS: A previously  published model that follows up patients through treatment of atrial fibrillation  during a lifetime was adapted to allow comparison of the 3 NOACs and warfarin. Acute  thromboembolic and bleeding events, as well as long-term consequences of stroke,  intracranial hemorrhage, and acute myocardial infarction, were tracked. Relative  efficacy was calculated from a formal indirect treatment comparison using data from  the 3 key trials (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy,  Rivaroxaban Once-daily oral direct factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K  antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation, and  Apixaban for the Prevention of Stroke in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation) of the  NOACs. Data from the rivaroxaban trial were adjusted for the difference in  international normalized ratio control among warfarin patients versus the other 2  trials. Model outputs included total costs, event rates, and quality-adjusted  life-years. FINDINGS: Among the patients taking NOACs, those taking dabigatran had  the highest total QALYs (7.68 QALYs), followed by apixaban (7.63 QALYs) and  rivaroxaban (7.47 QALYs). Patients taking dabigatran had the lowest total lifetime  costs (£23,342), followed by apixaban (£24,014) and rivaroxaban (£25,220). The  differences between dabigatran and apixaban were modest but consistent in  sensitivity analyses, with the directionality only changing at the limits of the CIs  for the relative risks of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage or when  assuming that both treatment discontinuation and post-event disability rates differ  by drug. IMPLICATIONS: Dabigatran was found to be economically dominant over  rivaroxaban and apixaban in the UK setting. These economic findings are based on  relative clinical efficacy from an indirect treatment comparison and would benefit  from any data of direct comparisons of the NOACs in the future.",Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

Statistical modeling approaches, which control for differences in patient  characteristics, can improve indirect comparisons of the efficacy of these  therapies. METHODS: No evidence of disease activity (NEDA) was evaluated as the  proportion of patients free from relapses and 3-month confirmed disability  progression (clinical composite), free from gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions and new  or newly enlarged T2 lesions (magnetic resonance imaging composite), or free from  all disease measures (overall composite). For each measure, the efficacy of  fingolimod was estimated by analyzing individual patient data from fingolimod phase  3 trials using methodologies from studies of other oral therapies. These data were  then used to build binomial regression models, which adjusted for differences in  baseline characteristics between the studies. Models predicted the indirect relative  risk of achieving NEDA status for fingolimod versus dimethyl fumarate or  teriflunomide in an average patient from their respective phase 3 trials. RESULTS:  The estimated relative risks of achieving NEDA status for fingolimod versus placebo  in a pooled fingolimod trial population were numerically greater (i.e., fingolimod  more efficacious) than the estimated relative risks for dimethyl fumarate or  teriflunomide versus placebo in each respective trial population. In indirect  comparisons, the predicted relative risks for all composite measures were better for  fingolimod than comparator when tested against the trial populations of those  treated with dimethyl fumarate (relative risk, clinical: 1.21 [95% confidence  interval 1.06-1.39]; overall: 1.67 [1.08-2.57]), teriflunomide 7 mg (clinical: 1.22  [1.02-1.46]; overall: 2.01 [1.38-2.93]) and teriflunomide 14 mg (clinical: 1.14  [0.96-1.36]; overall: 1.61 [1.12-2.31]). CONCLUSION: Our modeling approach suggests  that fingolimod therapy results in a higher probability of NEDA than dimethyl  fumarate and teriflunomide therapy when phase 3 trial data are indirectly compared  and differences between trials are adjusted for.",NA,"Nixon, Richard Bergvall, Niklas Tomic, Davorka Sfikas, Nikolaos Cutter, Gary Giovannoni, Gavin",Nixon R Bergvall N Tomic D Sfikas N Cutter G Giovannoni G,NA,"Novartis Pharma AG, Postfach, 4002, Basel, Switzerland, richard.nixon@novartis.com.",eng,NA,"Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20141121,NA,Adv Ther,Advances in therapy,8611864,NA,NA,NA,2014/11/22 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,2014/11/22 06:00,2014/08/15 00:00 [received] 2014/11/22 06:00 [entrez] 2014/11/22 06:00 [pubmed] 2016/03/24 06:00 [medline],167 [pii] 10.1007/s12325-014-0167-z [doi],ppublish,Adv Ther. 2014 Nov;31(11):1134-54. doi: 10.1007/s12325-014-0167-z.

The primary aims of  psychological interventions targeting chronic pain disorders are to reduce patients'  pain-related disability and to improve their quality of life. Cognitive behavioral  therapy (CBT) is the prevailing treatment for chronic pain, however  mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has displayed promise as an alternative  treatment option. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to  compare MBSR to CBT in their relative ability to reduce pain-related disability and  intensity, to alleviate emotional distress, and to improve global functioning in  chronic pain patients. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review with  meta-analyses to compare MBSR to CBT in the treatment of chronic pain disorders in  adults. We will report our review according to the recommendations provided by the  PRISMA statement. Randomized studies will be included and the literature search will  comprise Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations,  Embase Classic+Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library on Wiley, including CENTRAL,  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, and HTA. Study selection and data  extraction will be conducted by independent investigators and in duplicate. Outcomes  of interest will include pain interference, pain intensity, emotional functioning,  and patient global impression of change. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used  to assess risk of bias of included studies. As we anticipate that scales used to  measure participant responses will be related but varied from study to study,  standardized mean differences will be used to compare effect sizes between treatment  modalities. Given the possibility of little or no head-to-head evidence comparing  MBSR with CBT, we will use indirect treatment comparison methodology to assess the  relative effectiveness of these interventions. DISCUSSION: The findings from this  study will assist patients and treatment providers to make informed decisions  regarding evidence-based treatment selection for chronic pain disorders.

Recognize the high risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) in  patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. 2. Distinguish the different  pharmacological mechanisms of VTE prophylaxis drugs. 3. Delineate the advantages and  disadvantages of each VTE prophylaxis drug. 4. Recognize that rivaroxaban is as  efficacious as apixaban but can increase the risk of hemorrhage. Patients undergoing  major orthopedic surgery are at high risk for developing postoperative venous  thromboembolism (VTE). The authors analyzed the available evidence on the efficacy  and safety of dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban vs low-molecular-weight heparins  (LMWHs) as VTE prophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery. Outcomes evaluated included  total VTE, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), death, and major  bleeding. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are more efficacious than dabigatran and are as  safe as dabigatran. Rivaroxaban is as efficacious as apixaban but can increase the  risk of hemorrhage.","Copyright 2014, SLACK Incorporated.","Cui, Juncheng Wu, Bei Liu, Congwei Li, Zhihong",Cui J Wu B Liu C Li Z,NA,NA,eng,NA,Journal Article Review Systematic Review,NA,United States,Orthopedics,Orthopedics,7806107,IM,NA,NA,2014/11/02 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,2014/11/01 06:00,2013/07/29 00:00 [received] 2014/01/13 00:00 [accepted] 2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez] 2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed] 2015/10/08 06:00 [medline],10.3928/01477447-20141023-07 [doi],ppublish,Orthopedics. 2014 Nov;37(11):763-71. doi: 10.3928/01477447-20141023-07.,37,11,763-71,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20151007,"0 (Anticoagulants) 0 (Benzimidazoles) 0 (Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight) 0 (Morpholines) 0 (Pyrazoles) 0 (Pyridones) 0 (Thiophenes) 11P2JDE17B (beta-Alanine) 3Z9Y7UWC1J (apixaban) 9NDF7JZ4M3 (Rivaroxaban) I0VM4M70GC (Dabigatran)","Anticoagulants/*therapeutic use Benzimidazoles/therapeutic use Dabigatran Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/*therapeutic use Humans Morpholines/therapeutic use *Orthopedic Procedures Postoperative Complications/*prevention & control Pyrazoles/therapeutic use Pyridones/therapeutic use Rivaroxaban Thiophenes/therapeutic use Venous Thromboembolism/*prevention & control beta-Alanine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study indirectly compares MR in patients  taking nilotinib 300 mg bid with that in those taking dasatinib 100 mg qd by 12  months and through 48 months. METHODS: Patients in ENESTnd were re-weighted to match  published baseline characteristics reported for DASISION using a propensity score  model. After matching, differences in rates of major MR (MMR, measured as a 3 log  reduction on the International Scale [IS]), MR(4.0) (4 log reduction on IS), and  MR(4.5) (4.5 log reduction on IS) relative to imatinib were indirectly compared  between nilotinib and dasatinib. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to indirectly compare  MR outcomes between nilotinib and dasatinib through 48 months of follow-up, while  rate differences were used to compare progression to AP/BC between nilotinib and  dasatinib by 48 months. RESULTS: After matching, rates of MR by 12 months were  higher with nilotinib vs dasatinib by 11.7% for MMR (p = 0.045), 8.2% for MR(4.0)  (p = 0.029), and 8.5% for MR(4.5) (p < 0.001). Higher rates of MMR (HR = 1.44,  p = 0.018) and MR(4.0) (HR = 1.58, p = 0.013) achievement were maintained with  nilotinib compared to dasatinib through 48 months of follow-up. No statistically  significant differences were observed for MR(4.5) through 48 months or progression  to AP/BC by 48 months. LIMITATIONS: LIMITATIONS include comparisons based solely on  indirect evidence and HRs for MR(4.0) and MR(4.5) from the DASISION trial being  extracted from cumulative incidence curves. CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison  suggests that nilotinib is associated with higher rates of achieving MMR, MR(4.0),  and MR(4.5) by 12 months compared to dasatinib for the treatment of newly diagnosed  CML-CP. In addition, higher rates of MR achievement with nilotinib were also  maintained through 48 months of follow-up.",NA,"Signorovitch, James E Betts, Keith A Reichmann, William M Thomason, Darren Galebach, Phil Wu, Eric Q Chen, Lei DeAngelo, Daniel J",Signorovitch JE Betts KA Reichmann WM Thomason D Galebach P Wu EQ Chen L DeAngelo DJ,NA,"Analysis Group Inc. , Boston, MA , USA.",eng,NA,"Journal Article Randomized Controlled Trial Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20141107,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,NOTNLM,Chronic myeloid leukemia Dasatinib Indirect comparison Long-term molecular response Nilotinib,2014/10/31 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,2014/10/31 06:00,2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez] 2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed] 2015/07/30 06:00 [medline],10.1185/03007995.2014.977992 [doi],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2015 Feb;31(2):315-22. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2014.977992.

Hence, the current analysis indirectly compared  available evidence on the risk of hypoglycaemia and weight change between  lixisenatide and NPH-insulin based on randomized controlled trial (RCT) data with  exenatide, insulin glargine and placebo as common references. METHODS: A systematic  search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane database and clinical registries identified  English- and German-language articles published from January 1980 to October 2012  reporting data from RCTs. Only publications of trials that reported outcomes from 24  to 30 weeks comparing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or basal insulin  versus another antidiabetic agent or placebo were included. Hypoglycaemia, patients  at glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) target and discontinuations due to adverse events  (AEs) were treated as binary variables, with risk ratios and odds ratios (ORs)  calculated. HbA1c and body weight were treated as continuous variables with  difference in mean change from baseline (MD) calculated. Meta-analyses were  performed with random effects models and indirect comparisons were performed  according to Bucher's method. RESULTS: Seven RCTs (n=3,301 patients) comparing the  efficacy and safety of lixisenatide, exenatide, insulin glargine and NPH-insulin  with different antidiabetic treatments in adult patients with T2DM were included in  the final analysis. In the adjusted indirect comparison, there was a significant  difference in symptomatic hypoglycaemia (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = [0.17, 0.85]) and in  confirmed hypoglycaemia (OR = 0.46; 95% CI = [0.22, 0.96]) favouring lixisenatide  over NPH-insulin and comparable changes in HbA1c from baseline (MD = 0.07%; 95% CI =  [-0.26%, 0.41%]). In contrast to NPH-insulin, there was a significant reduction in  body weight with lixisenatide (MD = -3.62 kg; 95% CI = [-5.86 kg, -1.38 kg]) at  study completion. The number of discontinuations due to AEs numerically favoured  NPH-insulin over lixisenatide (OR = 2.64; 95% CI = [0.25, 27.96]), with a broad  confidence interval. CONCLUSIONS: Lixisenatide treatment was associated with a lower  risk of hypoglycaemia and a greater weight loss compared with NPH-insulin. Glycaemic  control with lixisenatide treatment was comparable with NPH-insulin. These data  suggest that lixisenatide is a beneficial treatment option for T2DM patients with  inadequate glycaemic control on OADs, and is associated with reduced risk of  hypoglycaemia and weight gain.",NA,"Fournier, Marie Germe, Maeva Theobald, Karlheinz Scholz, Gerhard H Lehmacher, Walter",Fournier M Germe M Theobald K Scholz GH Lehmacher W,NA,"Sanofi, Paris, France.

Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a recent tool for evidence-based medicine  that draws strength from direct and indirect evidence generated from randomized  control trials. It facilitates comparisons across multiple treatment options, direct  comparisons of which have not been attempted till date due to multitude of reasons.  These indirect treatment comparisons of randomized controlled trials are based on  similarity and consistency assumptions that follow Bayesian or frequentist  statistics. Most NMAuntil date use Microsoft Windows WinBUGs Software for analysis  which relies on Bayesian statistics. Methodology of NMA is expected to undergo  further refinements and become robust with usage.

We estimated the comparative efficacy of different pharmacologic  interventions for postoperative prophylaxis of CD, through a network meta-analysis  of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the  literature through March 2014. We identified randomized controlled trials that  compared the abilities of mesalamine, antibiotics, budesonide, immunomodulators,  anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF) (started within 3 months of surgery), and/or  placebo or no intervention to prevent clinical and/or endoscopic relapse of CD in  adults after surgical resection. We used Bayesian network meta-analysis to combine  direct and indirect evidence and estimate the relative effects of treatment.  RESULTS: We identified 21 trials comprising 2006 participants comparing 7 treatment  strategies. In a network meta-analysis, compared with placebo, mesalamine (relative  risk [RR], 0.60; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.37-0.88), antibiotics (RR, 0.26; 95%  CrI, 0.08-0.61), immunomodulator monotherapy (RR, 0.36; 95% CrI, 0.17-0.63),  immunomodulator with antibiotics (RR, 0.11; 95% CrI, 0.02-0.51), and anti-TNF  monotherapy (RR, 0.04; 95% CrI, 0.00-0.14), but not budesonide (RR, 0.93; 95% CrI,  0.40-1.84), reduced the risk of clinical relapse. Likewise, compared with placebo,  antibiotics (RR, 0.41; 95% CrI, 0.15-0.92), immunomodulator monotherapy (RR, 0.33;  95% CrI, 0.13-0.68), immunomodulator with antibiotics (RR, 0.16; 95% CrI,  0.04-0.48), and anti-TNF monotherapy (RR, 0.01; 95% CrI, 0.00-0.05), but neither  mesalamine (RR, 0.67; 95% CrI, 0.39-1.08) nor budesonide (RR, 0.86; 95% CrI,  0.61-1.22), reduced the risk of endoscopic relapse. Anti-TNF monotherapy was the  most effective pharmacologic intervention for postoperative prophylaxis, with large  effect sizes relative to all other strategies (clinical relapse: RR, 0.02-0.20;  endoscopic relapse: RR, 0.005-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Based on Bayesian network  meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons, anti-TNF  monotherapy appears to be the most effective strategy for postoperative prophylaxis  for CD.",Copyright © 2015.

New oral anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran) are  recommended for antithrombotic therapy in patients with non-valvular atrial  fibrillation (NVAF) with moderate and high risk of stroke. OBJECTIVES: The objective  of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness ratio of apixaban compared to  dabigatran and rivaroxaban in patients with NVAF from the Russian Federation  national health care system perspective. METHODS: This analysis used a Markov model  that allowed estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for  apixaban compared to rivaroxaban and dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg over lifetime  horizon for patients with NVAF. The model enclosed cardiovascular event rates based  on the results of the indirect treatment comparison that combined data from the  randomized clinical trials comparing clinical effectiveness and safety of apixaban,  rivaroxaban and dabigatran with warfarin (ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, RE-LY). The  following cardiovascular events were considered: ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke,  systemic embolism, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant  non-major bleeds and myocardial infarction. Direct medical costs were determined  based on the rates of the compulsory national medical insurance system. The price of  the new oral anticoagulants was taken as a weighted average tender price for the  year 2013. In the model both costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life years and  life-years) were discounted at 3.5%. Cost-effectiveness threshold was set at 1.4  million rubles per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and corresponded to the  three times GDP per capita in 2013 in the Russian Federation. RESULTS: In the base  case analysis it was demonstrated that apixaban compared to dabigatran 110 mg and  150 mg and rivaroxaban provided additional 0.101, 0.060 and 0.072 life years as well  as additional 0.063; 0.038 and 0.041 QALYs respectively. Over lifetime horizon  apixaban compared to dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg and rivaroxaban required  additional treatment costs equal to 22.78; 31.18 and 6.70 thousands rubles,  respectively. With that estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for apixaban  compared to dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg and rivaroxaban was 362.60, 805.54 and  162.45 thousands rubles per QALY correspondingly. CONCLUSION: Apixaban provided  increased life expectancy compared to other new anticoagulants and may be considered  as a cost-effective alternative to dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg and rivaroxaban from  the Russian Federation national health care system perspective.",NA,"Rudakova, A V Tatarskiĭ, B A",Rudakova AV Tatarskiĭ BA,NA,NA,rus,NA,Comparative Study English Abstract Journal Article,NA,Russia (Federation),Kardiologiia,Kardiologiia,0376351,IM,NA,NA,2014/09/02 06:00,2014/10/17 06:00,2014/09/02 06:00,2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez] 2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed] 2014/10/17 06:00 [medline],10.18565/cardio.2014.7.43-52 [doi],ppublish,Kardiologiia. 2014;54(7):43-52. doi: 10.18565/cardio.2014.7.43-52.,54,7,43-52,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20141016,0 (Anticoagulants) 0 (Benzimidazoles) 0 (Morpholines) 0 (Pyrazoles) 0 (Pyridones) 0 (Thiophenes) 11P2JDE17B (beta-Alanine) 3Z9Y7UWC1J (apixaban) 5Q7ZVV76EI (Warfarin) 9NDF7JZ4M3 (Rivaroxaban) I0VM4M70GC (Dabigatran),"Administration, Oral *Anticoagulants/economics/pharmacology *Atrial Fibrillation/blood/complications/drug therapy/economics/epidemiology Benzimidazoles/economics/pharmacology Blood Coagulation/*drug effects Cost-Benefit Analysis/*statistics & numerical data Dabigatran Drug Monitoring Hemorrhage/chemically induced/prevention & control Humans Models, Statistical Morpholines/economics/pharmacology *Myocardial Infarction/blood/etiology/mortality/prevention & control Prognosis Pyrazoles/economics/pharmacology Pyridones/economics/pharmacology Risk Factors Rivaroxaban Russia/epidemiology *Stroke/blood/etiology/mortality/prevention & control Thiophenes/economics/pharmacology Warfarin/economics/pharmacology beta-Alanine/analogs & derivatives/economics/pharmacology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
638,25275206,NA,Publisher,NA,NA,2014 Sep,NA,NA,"OBJECTIVE: Core needle biopsy and open surgical biopsy are the most frequently used  procedures for diagnosis of suspicious breast lesions. An AHRQ evidence report on  the comparative effectiveness and adverse events of breast biopsy methods was  completed in 2009. The availability of additional studies and the uncertainties  surrounding newer biopsy techniques prompted an update of that report. STUDY  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We searched nine electronic databases (last search on December  16, 2013) for English-language full-text reports of prospective or retrospective  cohort studies of women not previously diagnosed with breast cancer who were  undergoing biopsy for diagnosis of a breast lesion. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS  METHODS: A single investigator extracted quantitative and qualitative data from each  study; a second reviewer verified extracted data. We assessed the strength and  applicability of the evidence. We performed Bayesian meta-analyses to estimate  summary test performance and performed indirect comparisons to assess the relative  effectiveness of alternative core needle biopsy methods. Statistical models  accounted for between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty studies of  moderate to high risk of bias provided information on the test performance of  alternative core needle biopsy techniques. We found one new study investigating the  test performance of open biopsy. For women at average risk of cancer, both  ultrasound- and stereotactically guided biopsies had average sensitivities higher  than 0.97 and average specificities ranging from 0.92 to 0.99; freehand biopsy  methods had average sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.98. However, evidence  on the test performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy (6  studies) was insufficient to draw conclusions. Test performance did not differ  between women at average and high baseline risk of cancer, but results were  imprecise. Test performance of automated and vacuum-assisted devices (when using the  same imaging guidance) was fairly similar (absolute differences in sensitivity and  specificity ≤ 0.1). One hundred and forty-one studies contributed information on  potential harms of different core needle biopsy techniques. Overall, core needle  biopsy had a lower risk of complications than open surgical biopsy; however  information on the latter was sparse. The absolute incidence of adverse events was  low and the incidence of severe complications was less than 1 percent for all  techniques. Vacuum-assisted procedures appeared to be associated with increased  bleeding and hematoma formation; biopsies performed with patients seated upright  appeared to be associated with increased risk of vasovagal reactions. Harms were  reported inconsistently, raising concerns about selective outcome reporting. We  found 10 case reports of patients developing tumors at the site of prior core needle  biopsies. We found information on only a few patient-relevant and resource-related  outcomes. Based on 42 studies, core needle biopsy obviated the need for surgical  procedures in about 75 percent of women. Meta-analysis of 10 studies reporting the  number of surgical procedures required after biopsy suggested that the odds of  requiring only one procedure were almost 15 times as high among women receiving core  needle biopsy, as compared to those receiving open surgical biopsy. However, this  result may be confounded by indication. LIMITATIONS: Patient-level data were  unavailable and information about study- or population-level characteristics was too  limited to allow the identification of modifiers of test performance, adverse  events, or clinical outcomes. Studies reported adverse events incompletely, and did  not provide details of their outcome ascertainment methods. CONCLUSIONS: A large  body of evidence suggests that ultrasound and stereotactically guided core needle  biopsy procedures have sensitivity and specificity close to that of open biopsy  procedures, and are associated with fewer adverse events. The strength of the  evidence on the test performance of these methods is deemed moderate because studies  are at medium to high risk of bias, but provide precise and fairly consistent  results. Freehand procedures have lower sensitivity than imaging-guided methods. The  strength of evidence on the comparative test performance of automated and  vacuum-assisted devices (when using the same imaging guidance) is deemed low,  because of concerns about the risk of bias of included studies and the reliance on  indirect comparisons. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions for  MRI-guided biopsy or women at high baseline risk of cancer. There is low strength of  evidence that vacuum-assisted procedures have a higher risk of bleeding than  automated methods. There is moderate strength of evidence that women diagnosed with  breast cancer by core needle biopsy are more likely to have their cancer treated  with a single surgical procedure, compared with women diagnosed by open surgical  biopsy.",NA,"Dahabreh, Issa J Wieland, Lisa Susan Adam, Gaelen P Halladay, Christopher Lau, Joseph Trikalinos, Thomas A",Dahabreh IJ Wieland LS Adam GP Halladay C Lau J Trikalinos TA,NA,Brown Evidence-Based Practice Center Brown Evidence-Based Practice Center Brown Evidence-Based Practice Center Brown Evidence-Based Practice Center Brown Evidence-Based Practice Center Brown Evidence-Based Practice Center,eng,NA,Review Book,NA,Rockville (MD),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2014/09/01 00:00,NA,2014/09/01 00:00,NA,NBK246878 [bookaccession],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US),AHRQ Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,Core Needle and Open Surgical Biopsy for Diagnosis of Breast Lesions: An Update to  the 2009 Report,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: A  systematic literature review of randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients  with COPD was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olodaterol and  indacaterol. Network meta-analysis and adjusted indirect comparison methods were  employed to evaluate treatment efficacy, using outcomes based on trough forced  expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Transition Dyspnea Index, St George's  Respiratory Questionnaire total score and response, rescue medication use, and  proportion of patients with exacerbations. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were identified  for meta-analysis (eight, olodaterol; ten, indacaterol). Olodaterol trials included  patients of all severities, whilst indacaterol trials excluded patients with very  severe COPD. Concomitant maintenance bronchodilator use was allowed in most  olodaterol trials, but not in indacaterol trials. When similarly designed  trials/data were analyzed for change from baseline in trough FEV1 (liters), the  following mean differences (95% confidence interval) were observed: trials excluding  concomitant bronchodilator: indacaterol 75 mcg versus olodaterol 5 mcg, -0.005  (-0.077 to 0.067), and indacaterol 150 mcg versus olodaterol 5 mcg, 0.020 (-0.036 to  0.077); trials with concomitant tiotropium: indacaterol 150 mcg versus olodaterol 5  mcg, 0.000 (-0.043 to 0.042). In sensitivity analyses of the full network, results  for change from baseline in trough FEV1 favored indacaterol, but this dataset  suffered from trial design heterogeneity. For the other endpoints investigated, no  statistically significant differences were found when analyzed in the full network.  CONCLUSION: When compared under similar trial conditions, olodaterol and indacaterol  have similar efficacy in patients with COPD. This research highlights the importance  of considering the concomitant COPD medication when evaluating treatment effects in  COPD.",NA,"Roskell, Neil S Anzueto, Antonio Hamilton, Alan Disse, Bernd Becker, Karin",Roskell NS Anzueto A Hamilton A Disse B Becker K,NA,"Statistics, Bresmed Health Solutions Ltd, Sheffield, UK.

METHODS: A systematic literature review  was conducted in July to August 2011 and updated in July 2013. For fidaxomicin  versus vancomycin, efficacy was evaluated using meta-analysis of data from two Phase  III direct comparative studies (n = 1164). As there were no studies comparing  fidaxomicin and metronidazole, an indirect comparison was made using data from three  vancomycin versus metronidazole studies (n = 345), using the methodology of Bucher  et al. (J Clin Epidemiol 1997; 50: 683-91). This provides an OR for the indirect  comparison of fidaxomicin versus metronidazole when direct evidence of fidaxomicin  versus vancomycin and vancomycin versus metronidazole is available. RESULTS:  Clinical cure rates were similar for fidaxomicin and vancomycin; the OR (95% CI) was  1.17 (0.82, 1.66). Recurrence [0.47 (0.34, 0.65)] was significantly lower and  sustained cure rates [1.75 (1.35, 2.27)] significantly higher for fidaxomicin than  vancomycin. Similar results were obtained in patient subgroups with severe CDI and  with non-severe CDI. From the indirect comparison, the likelihood of recurrence  [0.42 (0.18, 0.96)] and sustained cure [2.55 (1.44, 4.51)] were significantly  improved for fidaxomicin versus metronidazole. Again, similar results were obtained  in those with severe and non-severe CDI. CONCLUSIONS: Fidaxomicin provides improved  sustained cure rates in patients with CDI compared with vancomycin. An indirect  comparison indicates that the same is also true for fidaxomicin versus  metronidazole. In view of these data, fidaxomicin may be considered as first-line  therapy for CDI.","© The Author 2014.

There are no head-to-head  trials comparing these agents. To assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs for  prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), we performed a network  meta-analysis. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane-controlled trial register  were searched, without language restriction, to identify trials. Studies were  evaluated according to a priori inclusion criteria and appraised using established  internal validity criteria. Adjusted indirect comparisons between agents were  performed using well-established methods. RESULTS: Three trials meeting inclusion  criteria were identified. Direct comparison between apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily  (BID) versus apixaban 5 mg BID showed no difference for any outcome. Clinically  relevant non-major bleeding occurred less with both apixaban 2.5 mg BID (OR 0.23,  95% CI 0.08-0.62, P=0.004) and apixaban 5 mg BID [OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.82,  P=0.019] compared to rivaroxaban 20 mg daily.

Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have  demonstrated survival benefits for combination therapy compared to gemcitabine  alone. However, the comparative benefits and harms of available combination  chemotherapy treatments are not clear. We therefore conducted a systematic review  and Bayesian network meta-analysis to assess the comparative safety and efficacy of  chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS:  MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Registry of Clinical trials and abstracts  from major scientific meetings were searched for RCTs published from 2002 to 2013.  Key outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and safety  including grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue  and sensory neuropathy. Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted to calculate  survival and safety outcomes using gemcitabine (GEM) as the reference comparator.  Effect estimates and 95% credible intervals were calculated for each comparison.  Mean ranks and the probability of being best were obtained for each treatment  analyzed in the network meta-analysis. RESULTS: The search identified 23 studies  involving 19 different treatment regimens and 9,989 patients. FOLFIRINOX,  GEM/cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU (PEFG), GEM/NAB-paclitaxel (NAB-P),  GEM/erlotinib+/-bevacizumab, GEM/capecitabine, and GEM/oxaliplatin were associated  with statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS relative to gemcitabine  alone and several other treatments. They were amongst the top ranked for survival  outcomes amongst other treatments included. No significant differences were found  for other combination chemotherapy treatments. Effect estimates from indirect  comparisons matched closely to estimates derived from pairwise comparisons. Overall,  combination therapies had greater risk for evaluated grade 3-4 toxicities over  gemcitabine alone. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head comparisons, we  performed a mixed-treatment analysis to achieve high-quality information on the  effectiveness and safety of each treatment. This study suggests that some  combination therapies may offer greater benefits in the treatment of advanced  pancreatic cancer than others. To more fully elucidate the comparative benefits and  harms of different combination chemotherapy regimens, rigorously conducted  comparative studies, or network meta-analysis of patient-level data are required.",NA,"Gresham, Gillian K Wells, George A Gill, Sharlene Cameron, Christopher Jonker, Derek J",Gresham GK Wells GA Gill S Cameron C Jonker DJ,NA,"Department of Epidemiology and Community Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa,  Ontario, Canada. ggresha3@jhu.edu.",eng,NA,"Journal Article Meta-Analysis Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Systematic Review",20140627,NA,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,NA,NA,2014/06/29 06:00,2015/02/28 06:00,2014/06/29 06:00,2013/07/30 00:00 [received] 2014/06/16 00:00 [accepted] 2014/06/29 06:00 [entrez] 2014/06/29 06:00 [pubmed] 2015/02/28 06:00 [medline],1471-2407-14-471 [pii] 10.1186/1471-2407-14-471 [doi],epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Jun 27;14:471. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-471.,14,NA,471,NA,PMC4097092,NA,NA,NA,NA,20150227,0 (Antineoplastic Agents),Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Bayes Theorem Databases as Topic Humans Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Survival Analysis Treatment Outcome,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials evaluating the NVF relative risk reduction  (RRR) with oral bisphosphonates or bazedoxifene were identified by a systematic  literature review and combined by means of a network meta-analysis. A subgroup of  patients with a FRAX score of 20% or more in the bazedoxifene phase III osteoporosis  study was selected as the population of interest on the basis of the bazedoxifene  label. In one analysis (analysis 1), the placebo response of the subgroup with a  FRAX score of 20% or more was the benchmark to select comparable bisphosphonate  trials. Additional analyses incorporated the aggregate data from the bisphosphonate  trials with all the FRAX subgroups (analysis 2) or with the individual patient data  from the bazedoxifene trial (analysis 3). RESULTS: Nine identified bisphosphonate  trials (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate; N = 23,440 patients) with a similar  placebo response as observed for the subgroup of high risk patients in the  bazedoxifene trial were included in analysis 1. The results of the network  meta-analysis of this study set suggest that bazedoxifene is expected to have an RRR  of 0.43 (95% credible interval [CrI] -0.19 to 0.72) versus alendronate, 0.58 (95%  CrI 0.05-0.81) versus ibandronate, and 0.39 (95% CrI -0.29 to 0.70) versus  risedronate. Analyses in which treatment effects with bisphosphonates were projected  to a population with a FRAX score of 20% or more with meta-regression approaches  (analysis 2 and analysis 3) provide similar findings. CONCLUSION: Based on an  indirect comparison of randomized trials, bazedoxifene is expected to have at least  a comparable RRR of NVF as alendronate, ibandronate, and risedronate in women with  higher risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis.",Copyright © 2014 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  (ISPOR).

METHODS: A stepwise  literature search specifically designed to identify indirect evidence was conducted  to extend the original clinical review from the latest National Institute for Health  and Care Excellence (NICE) VTE technology appraisal. Different network sizes or  network orders, based on the successive searches, informed three network  meta-analyses (NMAs), which were compared with a replicated base case. The resulting  comparative estimates were inputted in an economic model to investigate the effect  of network size on cost-effectiveness probabilities. RESULTS: Searches increased the  number of indirect comparisons between VTE interventions, progressively widening the  relevant network of studies for NMA. Precision around mean relative treatment  effects was increased as the network was extended from the base case to first-order  NMA, but further extensions had limited effect. Cost-effectiveness analysis results  were largely insensitive to variation in clinical inputs from the different NMA  orders. CONCLUSIONS: No standard methodology is currently recommended by NICE to  identify the most relevant network of studies for NMA. Our study showed that  optimizing the identification of studies for NMA can extend the evidence base for  analysis and reduce the uncertainty in relative effectiveness estimates. Although in  our example network extensions did not affect the acceptability of available  treatments in VTE prevention based on cost-effectiveness results, it may in other  applications.",Copyright © 2014 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  (ISPOR).

647,24967519,NLM,MEDLINE,20220321,2376-1032 (Electronic),2014 Jul,Medication effectiveness with the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors among  Texas Medicaid patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.,NA,"BACKGROUND: Adalimumab (Humira [ADA]), etanercept (Enbrel [ETN]), and infliximab  (Remicade [IFX]) are tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors indicated for the  treatment of a variety of disorders. While their effectiveness has not been directly  compared in a clinical trial, results from the majority of the indirect treatment  comparisons suggest comparable efficacy and safety profiles. However, these TNF  inhibitor agents differ in administration method and dosing flexibility, which may  result in differences in medication use profiles (e.g., adherence, persistence,  discontinuation, dose escalation, and switching to a new biologic rheumatoid  arthritis drug) and effectiveness in clinical practice.  OBJECTIVE: To estimate the  effectiveness of ADA, ETN, and IFX in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using  a validated, claims-based algorithm designed for large retrospective databases.  METHODS: Adult (aged 18-63 years) patients diagnosed with RA, and receiving ADA,  ETN, or IFX, and insured by Texas Medicaid were included. The index date was the  date of the first prescription claim for ADA or ETN or infusion record for IFX with  no claim or infusion record of a biologic drug in the preceding 6 months (i.e.,  biologic naïve). The study time frame was from July 2003 to August 2011, and  prescription and medical claims for each subject were analyzed over an 18-month  period (6 months pre- and 12 months post-index). Based on a RA medication  effectiveness algorithm (Curtis et al. 2011), a RA medication was classified as  effective if each of the following 6 criteria were met: (1) high medication  adherence (i.e., medication possession ratio [MPR] ≥ 80%, defined as the sum of  days' supply for all fills or infusions divided by the number of days in the study  period); (2) no switching to (or addition of) new biologic RA drugs; (3) no addition  of new nonbiologic RA drugs; (4) no increase in dose or frequency of administration  of the RA medication currently evaluated; (5) no more than 1 glucocorticoid (GC)  joint injection; and (6) no increase in dose of a concurrent oral GC. Propensity  score (PS) matching was employed, and paired tests (i.e., McNemar's) and  multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis were used to compare groups.  Demographic (i.e., age, gender, race) and clinical (i.e., use of nonbiologic  disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], pain medication use, GC medication  use, RA-related and non-RA-related health care visits [i.e., ambulatory and  inpatient visits], number of nonstudy RA medications, and comorbidity index)  characteristics, including total health care utilization cost at baseline, served as  study covariates. RESULTS: After PS matching, 822 patients (n = 274 per group) were  included. The majority of the sample (69.2%) was between 45-63 years, female (88%),  and Hispanic (53.7%). Results for each TNF inhibitor differed significantly for 2 of  the 6 effectiveness criteria (i.e., medication adherence and dose escalation). A  significantly higher proportion of patients on IFX were adherent compared with  patients on ETN or ADA (38.3% vs. 16.4% and 21.2%, P  less than  0.0001 for both).  Adherence rates between ETN and ADA were not significantly different. A  significantly higher (P  less than  0.0001) proportion of patients on ETN had no  dose escalation compared with patients on ADA or IFX (98.2% vs. 88.7% and 80.3%, P   less than  0.0001). Dose escalation rate was also significantly lower (P = 0.0106)  for ADA compared with IFX. The multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis  indicated no significant difference in overall effectiveness using the claims-based  algorithm among the 3 TNF inhibitors nor any significant relationship between  effectiveness and the study covariates.  CONCLUSION: The study results suggest that  when using a medication effectiveness algorithm, IFX, ETN, and ADA have comparable  effectiveness in patients with RA. Patient adherence to therapy may be higher if  given IFX, and patients who receive ETN are less likely to have a dose escalation.",NA,"Oladapo, Abiola Barner, Jamie C Lawson, Kenneth A Novak, Suzanne Rascati, Karen L Richards, Kristin M Harrison, David J",Oladapo A Barner JC Lawson KA Novak S Rascati KL Richards KM Harrison DJ,NA,"The University of Texas at Austin, 2409 University Ave., STOP A1930, Austin, TX  78712-1120. jbarner@austin.utexas.edu.",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,United States,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy,101644425,IM,NA,NA,2014/06/27 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,2014/06/27 06:00,2014/06/27 06:00 [entrez] 2014/06/27 06:00 [pubmed] 2015/02/24 06:00 [medline],2014(20)7: 657-667 [pii] 10.18553/jmcp.2014.20.7.657 [doi],ppublish,J Manag Care Spec Pharm. 2014 Jul;20(7):657-67. doi: 10.18553/jmcp.2014.20.7.657.,20,7,657-67,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20150220,"0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal) 0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized) 0 (Antirheumatic Agents) 0 (Immunoglobulin G) 0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor) 0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha) B72HH48FLU (Infliximab) FYS6T7F842 (Adalimumab) OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)","Adalimumab Adolescent Adult Algorithms Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic  use Antirheumatic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Etanercept Female Humans Immunoglobulin G/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use Infliximab Male Medicaid *Medication Adherence Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/administration & dosage/therapeutic use Retrospective Studies Texas Treatment Outcome Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors United States Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN:  Systematic review and indirect comparison meta-analysis. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE,  CENTRAL, conference proceedings, trial registers and reference lists were searched  up to October 2013 for randomized controlled trials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome  measures were patient satisfaction, re-intervention and complications rates,  reproductive outcomes, and hospitalization and recovery times. RESULTS: Five trials,  involving 436 women were included; two compared uterine artery embolization with  myomectomy and three compared uterine artery embolization with laparoscopic uterine  artery occlusion. Indirect treatment comparison showed that myomectomy and uterine  artery embolization resulted in higher rates of patient satisfaction (odds ratio  2.56, 95% credible interval 0.56-11.75 and 2.7, 95% credible interval 1.1-7.14,  respectively) and lower rates of clinical failure (odds ratio 0.29, 95% credible  interval 0.06-1.46 and 0.37, 95% credible interval 0.13-0.93, respectively) than  laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion. Myomectomy resulted in lower re-intervention  rate than uterine artery embolization (odds ratio 0.08, 95% credible interval  0.02-0.27) and laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion (odds ratio 0.08, 95% credible  interval 0.01-0.37) even though the latter techniques had an advantage over  myomectomy because of shorter hospitalization and quicker recovery. There was no  evidence of difference between the three techniques in ovarian failure and  complications rates. The evidence for reproductive outcomes is poor.

Preservative-free  (PF) latanoprost [Monoprost(®)] is a new formulation of latanoprost that is approved  for use in the EU in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)/ocular  hypertension. This article reviews the clinical pharmacology of this new  formulation, focussing on its efficacy and tolerability in this indication. PF  latanoprost was efficacious in reducing IOP in a randomized, investigator-masked,  multinational trial in patients with POAG/ocular hypertension (n = 404). At days 15,  42 and 84 of follow-up, PF latanoprost was noninferior to benzalkonium  chloride-preserved (BAK) latanoprost in terms of reductions in IOP. In this trial,  at days 42 and 84 the proportions of patients with conjunctival hyperaemia were  significantly lower with PF latanoprost than with BAK latanoprost. Patient  subjective ratings of ocular symptoms were also significantly lower with PF  latanoprost than with BAK latanoprost. In the absence of head-to-head comparisons  with other anti-glaucoma drugs, an adjusted, indirect comparison meta-analysis was  performed using data from 21 randomized clinical trials in patients with POAG/ocular  hypertension.

This also applies to a therapeutic  context where investigators of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are interested in  interactions between treatment assignment and one or more continuous predictors.  METHODS/DESIGN: Our goal is to apply the multivariable fractional polynomial  interaction (MFPI) approach to investigate interactions between continuous patient  baseline variables and the allocated treatment in an individual patient data  meta-analysis of three RCTs (N = 2,299) from the intensive care field. For each  study, MFPI will provide a continuous treatment effect function. Functions from each  of the three studies will be averaged by a novel meta-analysis approach for  functions. We will plot treatment effect functions separately for each study and  also the averaged function. The averaged function with a related confidence interval  will provide a suitable basis to assess whether a continuous patient characteristic  modifies the treatment comparison and may be relevant for clinical decision-making.  The compared interventions will be a higher or lower positive end-expiratory  pressure (PEEP) ventilation strategy in patients requiring mechanical ventilation.  The continuous baseline variables body mass index, PaO2/FiO2, respiratory  compliance, and oxygenation index will be the investigated potential effect  modifiers. Clinical outcomes for this analysis will be in-hospital mortality, time  to death, time to unassisted breathing, and pneumothorax. DISCUSSION: This project  will be the first meta-analysis to combine continuous treatment effect functions  derived by the MFPI procedure separately in each of several RCTs. Such an approach  requires individual patient data (IPD). They are available from an earlier IPD  meta-analysis using different methods for analysis. This new analysis strategy  allows assessing whether treatment effects interact with continuous baseline patient  characteristics and avoids categorization-based subgroup analyses. These interaction  analyses of the present study will be exploratory in nature. However, they may help  to foster future research using the MFPI approach to improve interaction analyses of  continuous predictors in RCTs and IPD meta-analyses.

METHODS: Randomized trials comparing CIS-containing  with non-CIS-containing chemotherapy regimens were identified in PubMed. Included  studies were performed from 1990 to 2010, used SCr or CrCl as an eligibility  criterion, and reported incidence of grade ≥3 nephrotoxicity for both treatment arms  using World Health Organization (WHO) or National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity  criteria. The relative risk (RR) of grade ≥3 nephrotoxicity associated with CIS  versus non-CIS regimens was examined. Subgroup analyses, adjusted indirect  comparison, and metaregression were used to compare SCr and CrCl. RESULTS: The  literature search identified 2359 studies, 42 studies met all the inclusion criteria  (N=9521 patients). SCr was used as an eligibility criterion in 20 studies (N=4704),  CrCl was used in 9 studies (N=1650), and either was used in 13 studies (N=3167). The  overall RR for developing nephrotoxicity with CIS versus non-CIS treatment was 1.75  (P=0.005). Subgroup analyses showed an increased risk when SCr was used (RR=2.60,  P=0.005) but not when CrCl was used (RR=1.50, P=0.19). Both the adjusted indirect  comparison and metaregression showed a nonsignificantly reduced risk of  nephrotoxicity when CrCl was used. CONCLUSIONS: CIS-based therapy was associated  with a significant increase in severe nephrotoxicity. The risk of severe  nephrotoxicity appears to be lower when CrCl was used to determine whether people  should be treated with CIS.",NA,"Dahal, Arati Bellows, Brandon K Sonpavde, Guru Tantravahi, Srinivas K Choueiri, Toni K Galsky, Matthew D Agarwal, Neeraj",Dahal A Bellows BK Sonpavde G Tantravahi SK Choueiri TK Galsky MD Agarwal N,NA,"*Department of Health Services, School of Public Health, University of Washington,  Seattle, WA †Pharmacotherapy Outcomes Research Center §Huntsman Cancer Institute,  University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ‡UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center, Birmingham,  AL ∥Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical  School, Boston, MA ¶The Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai Medical Center, Mount  Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY.",eng,NA,Comparative Study Journal Article Meta-Analysis Review,NA,United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,NA,NA,2014/05/16 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,2014/05/15 06:00,2014/05/15 06:00 [entrez] 2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed] 2017/07/25 06:00 [medline],10.1097/COC.0000000000000081 [doi],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2016 Oct;39(5):497-506. doi: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000081.,39,5,497-506,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20170724,0 (Antineoplastic Agents) AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine) Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin),Acute Kidney Injury/*chemically induced/*epidemiology Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects Cisplatin/*adverse effects Creatinine/*blood/*urine Humans Incidence Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Assessment/methods,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Initially, meta-analyses were proposed as a  technique that could improve the accuracy and the statistical power of previous  research from individual studies with small sample size. However, one of its main  limitations has been the fact of being able to compare no more than two treatments  in an analysis, even when the clinical research question necessitates that we  compare multiple interventions. Network meta-analysis (NMA) uses novel statistical  methods that incorporate information from both direct and indirect treatment  comparisons in a network of studies examining the effects of various competing  treatments, estimating comparisons between many treatments in a single analysis.  Despite its potential limitations, NMA applications in clinical epidemiology can be  of great value in situations where there are several treatments that have been  compared against a common comparator. Also, NMA can be relevant to a research or  clinical question when many treatments must be considered or when there is a mix of  both direct and indirect information in the body of evidence.","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

METHODS: Eight RCTs assessing vertebral fracture risk reduction with oral  bisphosphonates (n = 7) or bazedoxifene (n = 1) were identified by a systematic  literature review. Individual study results were pooled in a network meta-analysis  (NMA) to indirectly compare treatment effects for overall PMO women and a  higher-risk subgroup (FRAX ≥ 20%). Three sets of NMA analyses were conducted:  aggregate data (AD) from the bisphosphonate RCTs and bazedoxifene RCT for the full  population or the FRAX ≥20% subgroup (NMA AD); bisphosphonate AD and bazedoxifene AD  from each FRAX subgroup adjusted for baseline risk (NMA AD meta-regression); and  bisphosphonate AD and bazedoxifene individual patient data (IPD) adjusted for  baseline risk/FRAX (NMA AD/IPD meta-regression). RESULTS: For the overall  population, bisphosphonates had lower fracture risks versus bazedoxifene although  there is considerable uncertainty in supporting one intervention over another. The  relative risk reduction (RRR) for bazedoxifene was -0.23 (95% CrI: -1.11, 0.27)  versus ibandronate, -0.17 (-0.76, 0.22) versus alendronate, and -0.06 (-0.62, 0.30)  versus risedronate. RESULTS from the meta-regression analyses were similar. For the  FRAX ≥20% population, estimated fracture rates with bazedoxifene were lower than  with bisphosphonates, but again the uncertainty limits strong interpretation. The  RRR for bazedoxifene was 0.51 (-0.31, 0.83) versus ibandronate, 0.53 (-0.18, 0.83)  versus alendronate, and 0.57 (-0.07, 0.85) versus risedronate. The meta-regression  analyses showed comparable findings. CONCLUSION: The analyses only considered  vertebral fractures for oral bisphosphonates versus bazedoxifene, and IPD was  available only for bazedoxifene. In light of this, bazedoxifene is comparable to  bisphosphonates in the overall PMO population and at least as effective as  bisphosphonates for preventing vertebral fractures among higher-risk PMO patients.  The findings suggest bazedoxifene performs better in higher-risk PMO than in the  overall PMO.",NA,"Ellis, Alexandra G Reginster, Jean-Yves Luo, Xuemei Bushmakin, Andrew G Williams, Robert Sutradhar, Santosh Mirkin, Sebastian Jansen, Jeroen P",Ellis AG Reginster JY Luo X Bushmakin AG Williams R Sutradhar S Mirkin S Jansen JP,NA,"Formerly at Mapi , Boston, MA , USA.",eng,T32 HS000011/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States,"Comparative Study Journal Article Meta-Analysis Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Systematic Review",20140502,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,NOTNLM,Bazedoxifene Bisphosphonates Fractures Indirect comparison Osteoporosis,2014/04/30 06:00,2015/06/02 06:00,2014/04/30 06:00,2014/04/30 06:00 [entrez] 2014/04/30 06:00 [pubmed] 2015/06/02 06:00 [medline],10.1185/03007995.2014.908279 [doi],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2014 Aug;30(8):1617-26. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2014.908279.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and adjusted  indirect comparison meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of NOACs for  this indication. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search through  November 2013 for randomized trials that evaluated treatment of acute VTE with a  NOAC including rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban. Trials had to report  at least one of the following outcomes of interest: mortality, recurrent VTE,  recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or major  bleeding. Included trials were evaluated for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias  tool. We performed an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis to evaluate the  comparative efficacy and safety of NOACs, reporting relative risks (RRs) and 95%  confidence intervals for each outcome. RESULTS: Six trials (n=27,069) met inclusion  criteria, one each evaluating apixaban and edoxaban and two trials each evaluating  rivaroxaban and dabigatran. Risk of bias was low for all trials. NOACS did not  differ significantly in the risk of mortality, recurrent VTE, recurrent PE or  recurrent DVT. Dabigatran increased major bleeding risk compared to apixaban [RR  2.69 (1.19 to 6.07)] as did edoxaban compared to apixaban [RR 2.74 (1.40 to 5.39)].  CONCLUSION: Although NOACs do not appear to differ in the efficacy of treating acute  VTE, data suggests apixaban to be the safer than some of its competitors.",Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to review information addressing this claim. OBJECTIVE: To  conduct an overview of existing evaluations of quality of reporting in network  meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons, and to compile a list of topics  which may require detailed reporting guidance to enhance future reporting quality.  METHODS: An electronic search of Medline and the Cochrane Registry of methodologic  studies (January 2004-August 2013) was performed by an information specialist.  Studies describing findings from quality of reporting assessments were sought.  Screening of abstracts and full texts was performed by two team members. Descriptors  related to all aspects of reporting a network meta-analysis were summarized.  RESULTS: We included eight reports exploring the quality of reporting of network  meta-analyses. From past reviews, authors found several aspects of network  meta-analyses were inadequately reported, including primary information about  literature searching, study selection, and risk of bias evaluations; statement of  the underlying assumptions for network meta-analysis, as well as efforts to verify  their validity; details of statistical models used for analyses (including  information for both Bayesian and Frequentist approaches); completeness of reporting  of findings; and approaches for summarizing probability measures as additional  important considerations. CONCLUSIONS: While few studies were identified, several  deficiencies in the current reporting of network meta-analyses were observed. These  findings reinforce the need to develop reporting guidance for network meta-analyses.  Findings from this review will be used to guide next steps in the development of  reporting guidance for network meta-analysis in the format of an extension of the  PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis)  Statement.",NA,"Hutton, Brian Salanti, Georgia Chaimani, Anna Caldwell, Deborah M Schmid, Chris Thorlund, Kristian Mills, Edward Catalá-López, Ferrán Turner, Lucy Altman, Douglas G Moher, David",Hutton B Salanti G Chaimani A Caldwell DM Schmid C Thorlund K Mills E Catalá-López F Turner L Altman DG Moher D,NA,"Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Faculty of Medicine,  University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review and quantify the global risk of  dyspnea of recent P2Y₁₂ inhibitor drugs, and evaluate its association with the  reversibility profile of P2Y₁₂ inhibitors. METHODS: A database search (March 2013)  retrieved randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing new antiplatelet drugs  (ticagrelor, prasugrel, cangrelor, elinogrel) with clopidogrel. The primary outcome  was the incidence of dyspnea. Placebo-controlled trials were excluded. Meta-analysis  was performed and estimates were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence  intervals (95% CIs). Dyspnea incidence was evaluated according to the reversibility  profile of P2Y₁₂ antagonists. RESULTS: We found eight RCTs including 41,289  patients. Prasugrel was not associated with an increased risk of dyspnea (RR 1.09,  95% CI 0.93-1.27), whereas ticagrelor (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.37-2.77), cangrelor (RR  2.42, 95% CI 1.36-4.33), and elinogrel (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.57-6.72) showed an  increased risk of dyspnea. Reversible inhibitors significantly increased the risk of  dyspnea compared with the irreversible inhibitor, prasugrel, through adjusted  indirect comparison (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.40-2.82).

We wanted to verify retrospectively the proportion of patients with  psoriatic arthritis who were in remission after 1 year of continuous therapy with  either etanercept or adalimumab. Remission was defined as the absence of both  clinical and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) findings suggestive of joint  inflammation. Patients and Methods. The data of twenty-five patients with psoriatic  arthritis were available for the clinical and CEUS evaluations before and after 1  year of continuous therapy with etanercept or adalimumab. The count of swollen  (ACR66), tender (ACR68), and active inflamed joints (AJC) was used to measure the  severity of joint involvement. PASI was used to score the severity of psoriasis.  HAQ, DLQI, VAS pain, and VAS itching were administered to each patient before  starting therapy and every 3 months, up to 1 year. Results. Eight (32%) out of  twenty-five patients were in remission after 1 year of therapy with etanercept or  adalimumab. A significant reduction of all clinical variables analysed was seen  during the course of therapy. Conclusion.

In chronic non-cancer  pain (CNCP), however, their use is controversial. Previous meta-analyses and  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) lack methodological homogeneity and comparable  data. Here we analysed the maximum analgesic efficacies of opioids and non-opioids  compared with placebo, and of physiotherapy and psychotherapy compared with active  or waiting-list controls. We screened 3647 citations and included RCTs if treatment  duration was at least 3 weeks, data were sufficient for meta-analysis, and criteria  for high quality were met. Only 46 studies (10 742 patients) met the criteria.  Weighted and standardized mean differences (WMD, SMD) between pain intensities were  pooled to conduct separate meta-analyses for each treatment category. At the end of  treatment the WMD for pain reduction (100-point scale) was 12.0 for 'strong'  opioids, 10.6 for 'weak' opioids, 8.4 for non-opioids (each vs. placebo), 5.5 for  psychotherapy and 4.5 for physiotherapy (each vs. active controls). Dropout rates  were high in pharmacological studies. The 95% confidence intervals using the  outcomes of control groups did not indicate statistical differences between  efficacies of the five interventions. Because not enough eligible head-to-head  trials were available, our analysis is limited to adjusted indirect comparisons. The  heterogeneity of pre-post pain differences in control groups did not allow the  definition of a common comparator. In conclusion, although there were statistically  significant differences between maximum treatment efficacies, no intervention per se  produced clinically important improvements in average pain intensity. Thus, opioids  alone are inappropriate and multimodal treatment programmes may be required for  CNCP.

The Task Force developed a  consensus-based 26-item questionnaire to help decision makers assess the relevance  and credibility of indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis to help  inform health care decision making. The relevance domain of the questionnaire (4  questions) calls for assessments about the applicability of network meta-analysis  results to the setting of interest to the decision maker. The remaining 22 questions  belong to an overall credibility domain and pertain to assessments about whether the  network meta-analysis results provide a valid answer to the question they are  designed to answer by examining 1) the used evidence base, 2) analysis methods, 3)  reporting quality and transparency, 4) interpretation of findings, and 5) conflicts  of interest. The questionnaire aims to help readers of network meta-analysis opine  about their confidence in the credibility and applicability of the results of a  network meta-analysis, and help make decision makers aware of the subtleties  involved in the analysis of networks of randomized trial evidence.

POPULATION: children and adolescents. SETTING: Europe.  Comparators: methylphenidate (MPH), atomoxetine (ATX), and dexamphetamine (DEX).  Electronic databases and relevant conference proceedings were searched for  randomized, controlled clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety of at least  one of the comparators and LDX. Quality assessments for each included trial were  performed using criteria recommended by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination.  Network meta-analysis methods for dichotomous outcomes were employed to evaluate  treatment efficacy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response, as defined by either a  reduction from baseline of at least 25% in the ADHD Rating Scale [ADHD-RS] total  score or, separately, as assessed on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement  [CGI-I] scale, and safety (all-cause withdrawals and withdrawal due to adverse  events). RESULTS: The systematic review found 32 trials for the meta-analysis,  including data on LDX, ATX, and different formulations of MPH. No trials for DEX  meeting the inclusion criteria were found. Sufficient data were identified for each  outcome: ADHD-RS, 16 trials; CGI-I, 20 trials; all-cause withdrawals, 28 trials; and  withdrawals due to adverse events, 27 trials. The relative probability of treatment  response for CGI-I (95% confidence intervals [CI]) for ATX versus LDX was 0.65  (0.53-0.78); for long-acting MPH versus LDX, 0.82 (0.69-0.97); for intermediate  release MPH versus LDX, 0.51 (0.40-0.65); and for short-acting MPH versus LDX, 0.62  (0.51-0.76). The relative probabilities of ADHD-RS treatment response also favored  LDX. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of ADHD, the synthesis of efficacy data showed  statistically significant better probabilities of response with LDX than for  formulations of MPH or ATX.

We aimed to assess whether alternative treatment options such as  rivaroxaban or apixaban carry a similar risk as compared with dabigatran. METHODS:  We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials of apixaban,  dabigatran or rivaroxaban against control (placebo, heparin or vitamin K  antagonist). We pooled odds ratios (OR) for adverse coronary events (acute coronary  syndrome or myocardial infarction) using fixed effect meta-analysis and assessed  heterogeneity with I(2) . We conducted adjusted indirect comparisons to compare risk  of adverse coronary events with apixaban or rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran. RESULTS:  Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Dabigatran was  associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse coronary events in pooled  analysis of nine trials (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.14, 1.86). There was no signal for  coronary risk with apixaban from nine trials (pooled OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or  rivaroxaban from nine trials (pooled OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72, 0.93). Overall, adjusted  indirect comparison suggested that both apixaban (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44, 0.85) and  rivaroxaban (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.39, 0.76) were associated with lower coronary risk  than dabigatran. Restricting the indirect comparison to a vitamin K antagonist as a  common control, yielded similar findings, OR 0.57 (95% CI 0.39, 0.85) for apixaban  vs. dabigatran and 0.53 (95% CI 0.37, 0.77) for rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran.

Meta-regression and graphical inspection of suspected clinical  factors.,10.1093/rheumatology/ket492 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore which clinical factors and patient  characteristics are associated with the magnitude of comparative efficacy between  biologics vs. MTX in RA patients with inadequate response to MTX. METHODS: We  included randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of a biologic plus MTX  vs. MTX alone. We examined several clinical factors and patient characteristics  potentially associated with magnitude of response, measured as ACR20 (20%  improvement in ACR criteria) and ACR50 (16-26 weeks). We employed meta-regression  for formal estimates and statistical significance of effect modification. We  produced regression and forest plots to further inspect potential associations.  RESULTS: For ACR50, a 1-year increment on the average patient disease duration was  statistically significantly associated with a 16% relative increase in the pooled  odds ratio (OR) estimate (P = 0.003). A 1-year increment in patient age and a 1  mg/week increment in MTX dose were marginally statistically significantly associated  with a 9% (P = 0.056) and 22% (P = 0.092) relative increase in the OR. For ACR20,  the average number of swollen and tender joints was marginally statistically  associated with a 3% relative decrease. The associations for age and MTX dose  appeared to be partly driven by significant negative associations between these two  factors and the control group response. CONCLUSION: Our analyses identified key  variables associated with the magnitude of comparative effects for ACR outcomes. Our  findings provide valuable insights for future trial designs and systematic reviews  as well as decision-making and clinical practice.","© The Author 2014.

METHODS: Two comprehensive meta-analyses  with similar control arms (conventionally fractionated RT) were compared indirectly.  RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) of death with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the  overall comparison of altered fractionation RT with concomitant CRT was 1.13 (95%  CI, 0.97-1.29; p = .07) suggesting no significant difference between both  approaches. Compared to concomitant CRT, the HR for death was 1.01 (95% CI,  0.89-1.15; p = .82); 1.22 (95% CI, 0.94-1.59; p = .13); and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.07-1.39;  p = .002) for hyperfractionated RT; accelerated RT without total dose reduction; and  accelerated RT with total dose reduction, respectively. CONCLUSION: Concomitant CRT  and hyperfractionated RT are comparable to one another on indirect comparison in the  radiotherapeutic management of locoregionally advanced HNSCC.

METHODS: PubMed, the  Cochrane library, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched to find randomized  controlled trials [RCTs]. Direct pair-wise meta analysis (DMA), indirect treatment  comparison meta analysis (ITC) and NMA were conducted to compare different kinds of  LC. RESULTS: We included 43 RCTs. The risk of bias of included studies was high. DMA  showed that SPLC was associated with more postoperative complications, longer  operative time, and higher cosmetic score than 4PLC, longer operative time and  higher cosmetic score than 3PLC, more postoperative complications than mini-4PLC.  Mini-4PLC was associated with longer operative time than 4PLC. ITC showed that 3PLC  was associated with shorter operative time than mini-4PLC, and lower postoperative  pain level than 2PLC. 2PLC was associated with fewer postoperative complications and  longer hospital stay than SPLC. NMA showed that SPLC was associated with more  postoperative complications than mini-4PLC, and longer operative time than 4PLC.  CONCLUSION: The rank probability plot suggested 4PLC might be the worst due to the  highest level of postoperative pain, longest hospital stay, and lowest level of  cosmetic score. The best one might be mini-4PLC because of highest level of cosmetic  score, and fewest postoperative complications, or SPLC because of lowest level of  postoperative pain and shortest hospital stay.

METHODS: PubMed  (1966-2011.12), the Cochrane Library (2011 Issue 2) and EMBASE (1974-2011.12) were  searched with the terms ""gastric cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"", as well as the medical  subject headings. References from relevant articles and conferences were also  included. Patients who had previous gastric surgery, radiation before or after  surgery or chemotherapy before surgery were excluded. In this study, only randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) were considered, and the end-point was the overall  mortality. Direct comparisons were performed using traditional meta-analysis whereas  indirect comparisons were performed using network meta-analysis. RESULTS: In total,  31 RCTs with 7120 patients were included. Five chemotherapy regimens, fluorouracil  (FU) + BCNU, FU + methyl-CCNU (mCCNU), FU + cisplatin, FU + anthracyclines and FU +  mitomycin c (MMC) + cytarabine (Ara-c), were found to be less beneficial in terms of  overall mortality.

The evidence for the FM regimen and MMC regimen was poor.  Additionally, the FMA regimen, which includes a variety of chemotherapy drugs and  causes many side effects, was not better than the Tegafur regimen.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of  apixaban against other NOACs from the perspective of the United Kingdom National  Health Services. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the  pharmacoeconomic impact of apixaban versus other NOACs over a lifetime. Pair-wise  indirect treatment comparisons were conducted against other NOACs by using ARISTOTLE  (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial  Fibrillation), RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy),  and ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With  Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial  Fibrillation) trial results for the following end points: ischemic stroke,  hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant  nonmajor bleeds, myocardial infarction, and treatment discontinuations. Outcomes  were life-years, quality-adjusted life years gained, direct health care costs, and  incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Apixaban was projected to increase  life expectancy versus other NOACs, including dabigatran (both doses) and  rivaroxaban. A small increase in therapeutic management costs was observed with  apixaban due to projected gains in life expectancy and lower discontinuation rates  anticipated on apixaban versus other NOACs through lifetime. The estimated  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £9611, £4497, and £5305 per  quality-adjusted life-year gained with apixaban compared with dabigatran 150 mg BID,  dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, respectively. Sensitivity  analyses indicated that results were robust over a wide range of inputs.  CONCLUSIONS: Although our analysis was limited by the absence of head-to-head  trials, based on the indirect comparison data available, our model projects that  apixaban may be a cost-effective alternative to dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran  110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for stroke prevention in AF patients  from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Services.",Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

Both are  burdened, however, by toxicity that could contribute to perioperative morbidity and  mortality. METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and Embase were searched to  capture the incidence of any postoperative complications, cardiac complications,  respiratory complications, anastomotic leakage, postoperative 30-day mortality,  total postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality in randomized clinical  trials comparing NAC or NACR with surgery alone, or NAC versus NACR. Meta-analyses  comparing NAC and NACR were conducted by using adjusted indirect comparison.  RESULTS: Twenty-three relevant studies were identified. Comparing NAC or NACR with  surgery alone, there was no increase in morbidity or mortality attributable to  neoadjuvant therapy. Subgroup analysis of NACR for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)  suggested an increased risk of total postoperative mortality and treatment-related  mortality compared with surgery alone: risk ratio 1·95 (95 per cent confidence  interval 1·06 to 3·60; P = 0·032) and 1·97 (1·07 to 3·64; P = 0·030) respectively. A  combination of direct comparison and adjusted indirect comparison showed no  difference between NACR and NAC regarding morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION:  Neither NAC nor NACR for oesophageal carcinoma increases the risk of postoperative  morbidity or perioperative mortality compared with surgery alone. There was no clear  difference between NAC and NACR. Care should be taken with NACR in oesophageal SCC,  where an increased risk of postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality  was apparent.",© 2014 BJS Society Ltd.

METHODS: A systematic review and Bayesian indirect treatment  comparison meta-analyses were performed for seven patient-important clinical  outcomes at 8 weeks and 52 weeks. Odds ratio (OR) estimates and associated 95%  credible intervals (CrIs) were produced. RESULTS: Five eligible RCTs informed  clinical remission, response, mucosal healing, quality of life, colectomy, serious  adverse events, and discontinuation due to adverse events at 8 weeks and 52 weeks.  At 8 weeks of induction therapy, clinical remission (OR=0.42, 95% CrI 0.17-0.97),  clinical response (OR=0.45, 95% CrI 0.23-0.89) and mucosal healing (OR=0.46, 95% CrI  0.25-0.86) statistically favored infliximab. However, after 52 weeks of maintenance  therapy OR estimates showed no significant difference between infliximab and  adalimumab. For serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events,  adalimumab and infliximab were similar to placebo. Further, the indirect treatment  comparison of adalimumab and infliximab yielded odds ratios close to 1.00 with wide  credible intervals. CONCLUSION: The findings of this indirect treatment comparison  meta-analysis suggest that both infliximab and adalimumab are superior to placebo in  the treatment of moderate to moderately severe ulcerative colitis. While infliximab  is statistically more effective than adalimumab in the induction of remission,  response and mucosal healing at 8 weeks, infliximab and adalimumab are comparable in  efficacy at 52 weeks of maintenance treatment.",Copyright © 2014 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.

METHODS: A systematic search  identified six randomised controlled trials (amlodipine/losartan-3,  amlodipine/valsartan-3) of FDCs and their component monotherapies. Conventional  fixed-effects methods were used to conduct the comparisons. The primary and  secondary effect measures were the changes in sitting diastolic and systolic blood  pressure (sitDBP, sitSBP) at 8 weeks post-randomisation. RESULTS: The estimated  amlodipine/valsartan - amlodipine/losartan difference (95% confidence interval) in  sitDBP reduction was -1.27 mmHg, (-5.7, 2.2) for lower dosages and -0.45 mmHg,  (-3.7, 2.7) for higher dosages; for sitSBP, the values were -3.74 mmHg, (-9.0, 2.9)  for lower dosages and 0.2 mmHg, (-6.2, 6.0) for higher dosages. The confidence of a  greater reduction in BP (fixed difference = 0) on amlodipine/losartan 5/50 than on  amlodipine/valsartan 5/80 was 77% for sitDBP and 89% for sitSBP. The corresponding  confidence for the higher doses was 61% for sitDBP and 48% for sitSBP. The findings  support asserting with (fixed) 95% confidence that the BP reduction on  amlodipine/valsartan 5/80 exceeds the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 reduction by at most  1.6 mmHg for sitDBP, and at most 1.26 mmHg for sitSBP. The corresponding upper  bounds for the higher dosages were 2.31 mmHg (sitDBP) and 5.38 mmHg (sitSBP).  CONCLUSIONS: The BP lowering effect with amlodipine/losartan and  amlodipine/valsartan was comparable.

This study aimed to indirectly compare overall and progression-free among  everolimus, sunitinib and placebo across separate randomized trials. METHODS: A  matching adjusted indirect comparison was conducted in which individual patient data  from the pivotal trial of everolimus (n = 410) were adjusted to match the inclusion  criteria and average baseline characteristics reported for the pivotal trial of  sunitinib (n = 171). Prior to matching, trial populations differed in baseline  performance status and prior treatments.

METHODS: A patient-level simulation was adapted from the model used by the  University of Sheffield School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) in a health  technology appraisal of rituximab for first-line treatment of follicular lymphoma.  This approach allowed modelling of the complex treatment pathways in indolent NHL.  Data from a Phase 3 randomized, open-label trial were used to compare B-R with  CHOP-R. The relative efficacy of CHOP-R and CVP-R was estimated using an indirect  treatment comparison similar to the original ScHARR approach. The analysis was  conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales,  using a lifetime time horizon. A number of one-way sensitivity and scenario analyses  were conducted, including one using recently published data comparing CVP-R with  CHOP-R. RESULTS: The deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was  £5249 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for B-R vs CHOP-R, and £8092 per QALY  for B-R vs CVP-R. The alternative scenario using direct data comparing CVP-R with  CHOP-R approximately halved the ICER for B-R vs CVP-R to £4733. Owing to its better  toxicity profile, B-R reduced the cost of treating adverse events by over £1000 per  patient vs CHOP-R. LIMITATIONS: The main limitations were: immaturity of overall  survival data from the Phase 3 trial; reliance on quality-of-life data from previous  health technology appraisals (as this was not collected in the trial); and a lack of  direct evidence or a network of connected evidence comparing B-R with CVP-R.  CONCLUSIONS: The ICERs for B-R vs CHOP-R and CVP-R were considerably below the  thresholds normally regarded as cost-effective in England and Wales (£20,000-30,000  per QALY).",NA,"Dewilde, Sarah Woods, Beth Castaigne, Jean-Gabriel Parker, Christopher Dunlop, William",Dewilde S Woods B Castaigne JG Parker C Dunlop W,NA,"SHE , Brussels , Belgium.",eng,NA,"Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20140113,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,IM,NA,NA,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/09/24 06:00,2013/12/07 06:00,2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez] 2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed] 2014/09/24 06:00 [medline],10.3111/13696998.2013.873044 [doi],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2014 Feb;17(2):111-24. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2013.873044.

However, the efficacy and tolerability of the 2  combinations are unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled  trials of aliskiren/amlodpine and aliskiren/HCTZ for hypertension. METHODS: The  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Novartis  clinical trial database were searched through December 2012 for reports of  randomized controlled trials of aliskiren/amlodpine and aliskiren/HCTZ vs.  monotherapy in patients with hypertension. The main outcome measures were reduction  in systolic BP and diastolic BP from baseline and rates of therapeutic response and  BP control. Tolerance of aliskiren/amlodipine and aliskiren/HCTZ was also analyzed.  Outcomes were initially pooled by standard random-effects methods, producing a  weighted mean difference (WMD) or risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals  (CIs). The pooled estimates were then used for adjusted indirect comparisons.  RESULTS: We selected 19 reports of trials involving 13,614 participants.  Aliskiren/amlodpine and aliskiren/HCTZ were more effective than monotherapy in  controlling BP. Aliskiren/amlodipine was significantly more effective than  aliskiren/HCTZ in reducing systolic BP (WMD = -3.36 mm Hg; 95% CI = -4.64 to 2.07 mm  Hg) and diastolic BP (WMD = -3.49 mm Hg; 95% CI = -4.34 to 2.63 mm Hg). As compared  with aliskiren/HCTZ, alikiren/amlodipine was associated with higher rate of  therapeutic response (RR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.14-1.33) and BP control (RR = 1.24; 95%  CI = 1.11-1.39). Number of adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events were  similar with aliskiren/amlodipine and aliskiren/HCTZ.

DESIGN. Indirect treatment  comparison and a cost-effectiveness assessment. SETTING: Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Those  having epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive non-small-cell  lung cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Erlotinib versus gefitinib use was compared on the basis  of four relevant Asian phase-III randomised controlled trials: one for erlotinib  (OPTIMAL) and three for gefitinib (IPASS; NEJGSG; WJTOG). The cost-effectiveness  assessment model simulates the transition between the health states:  progression-free survival, progression, and death over a lifetime horizon. The World  Health Organization criterion (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <3 times of  gross domestic product/capita: <US$102 582; approximately <HK$798 078) was used to  rate cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The best fit of study characteristics and  prognostic patient characteristics were found between the OPTIMAL and IPASS trials.  Comparing progression-free survival hazard ratios of erlotinib versus gefitinib  using only these randomised controlled trials in an indirect treatment comparison  resulted in a statistically significant progression-free survival difference in  favour of erlotinib (indirect treatment comparison hazard ratio=0.33; 95% confidence  interval, 0.19-0.58; P=0.0001). The cost-effectiveness assessment model showed that  the cost per progression-free life year gained and per quality-adjusted life year  gained was at acceptable values of US$39 431 (approximately HK$306 773) and US$62  419 (approximately HK$485 619) for erlotinib versus gefitinib, respectively.  CONCLUSION: The indirect treatment comparison of OPTIMAL versus IPASS shows that  erlotinib is significantly more efficacious than gefitinib. Furthermore, the  cost-effectiveness assessment indicates that the incremental cost-effectiveness  ratios are well within an acceptable range in relation to the survival benefits  obtained. In conclusion, erlotinib is cost-effective compared to gefitinib for  first-line epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive  non-small-cell lung cancer patients.",NA,"Lee, Vivian W Y Schwander, Bjoern Lee, Victor H F",Lee VW Schwander B Lee VH,NA,"School of Pharmacy, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.

A systematic review and meta-analysis  was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of New Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs)  to warfarin in patients with AF and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack  (TIA). METHODS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including total 14527  patients, comparing NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban) with warfarin were  included in the analysis. Primary efficacy endpoint was ischemic stroke, and primary  safety endpoint was intracranial bleeding. Random-effects models were used to pool  efficacy and safety data across RCTs. RevMan and Stata software were used for direct  and indirect comparisons, respectively. RESULTS: In patients with AF and previous  stroke or TIA, effects of NOACs were not statistically different from that of  warfarin, in reduction of stroke (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]  0.73- 1.01), disabling and fatal stroke (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71-1.04), and all-cause  mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 -1.02). Randomization to NOACs was associated with a  significantly lower risk of intracranial bleeding (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.25-0.70). There  were no major differences in efficacy between apixaban, dabigatran (110 mg BID and  150 mg BID) and rivaroxaban. Major bleeding was significantly lower with apixaban  and dabigatran (110 mg BID) compared with dabigatran (150 mg BID) and rivaroxaban.

This might be attributable to β1-selective blockers. INTRODUCTION: The aim of  this study is to determine by meta-analysis whether β-adrenergic blockers (BBs)  reduce fracture risk and whether the effect, if demonstrable, is dependent upon  selectivity, dose, gender, or fracture site. METHODS: A literature search was  performed in electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and reference sections of  relevant articles to identify eligible studies. Adjusted estimates of fracture risk  effect size (ES) were pooled across studies using fixed or random-effects (RE)  meta-analysis as appropriate. Dose-related effects were evaluated using  meta-regression. To explore the relative efficacy of β1-selective blockers in  comparison to nonselective BBs, adjusted indirect comparison was performed. RESULTS:  A total of 16 studies (7 cohort and 9 case-control studies), involving 1,644,570  subjects, were identified. The risk of any fracture was found to be significantly  reduced in subjects receiving BBs as compared to control subjects (16 studies, RE  pooled ES = 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.93; I(2) = 87 %). In a sensitivity analysis limited  to those studies deemed to be most robust, the BB effect to reduce fracture risk was  sustained (four studies, pooled ES = 0.79, 95% CI 0.67-0.94; I(2) = 96%). The risk  of a hip fracture was lower in both women and men receiving BBs (women: pooled ES =  0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.91; I(2) = 1% and men: pooled ES = 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.90; I(2)  = 0%). Similar risk reductions were found for clinical vertebral and forearm  fractures, although statistical significance was not reached. The reduction in risk  did not appear to be dose-related (test for a linear trend p value 0.150). Using  adjusted indirect comparisons, it was estimated that β1-selective agents were  significantly more effective than nonselective BBs in reducing the risk of any  fracture (six studies, β1-selective blockers vs. nonselective BBs: RE pooled ES =  0.82, 95% CI = 0.69-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the risk of  fracture is approximately 15% lower in patients treated with BBs compared to  controls independent of gender, fracture site, and dose. This risk reduction might  be associated with the effects of β1-selective blockers.",NA,"Toulis, K A Hemming, K Stergianos, S Nirantharakumar, K Bilezikian, J P",Toulis KA Hemming K Stergianos S Nirantharakumar K Bilezikian JP,NA,"Department of Endocrinology, 424 General Military Hospital, Ring Road, Efkarpia,  P.O.

METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane Library  databases were searched for opioid publications between September 1, 2001 and August  31, 2011, and pivotal clinical trials from all years; abstracts from key pain  conferences (2010-2011) were also reviewed. One hundred and ninety-one publications  were initially identified, 68 of which met eligibility criteria and were  systematically reviewed; a subset of 16 involved a placebo group (13 non-ADFs vs  placebo, 3 ADFs vs placebo) and reported both efficacy and safety outcomes, and were  included for a meta-analysis. Summary estimates of standardized difference in mean  change of pain intensity (DMCPI), standardized difference in sum of pain intensity  difference (DSPID), and odds ratios (ORs) of each adverse event (AE) were computed  through random-effects estimates for ADFs (and non-ADFs) vs placebo. Indirect  treatment comparisons were conducted to compare ADFs and non-ADFs. RESULTS: Summary  estimates for standardized DMCPI and for standardized DSPID indicated that ADFs and  non-ADFs showed significantly greater efficacy than placebo in reducing pain  intensity. Indirect analyses assessing the efficacy outcomes between ADFs and  non-ADFs indicated that they were not significantly different (standardized DMCPI  [0.39 {95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00-0.76}]; standardized DSPID [-0.22 {95% CI  -0.74 to 0.30}]). ADFs and non-ADFs both were associated with higher odds of AEs  than placebo. Odds ratios from indirect analyses comparing AEs for ADFs vs non-ADFs  were not significant (nausea, 0.87 [0.24-3.12]; vomiting, 1.54 [0.40-5.97];  dizziness/vertigo, 0.61 [0.21-1.76]; headache, 1.42 [0.57-3.53];  somnolence/drowsiness, 0.47 [0.09-2.58]; constipation, 0.64 [0.28-1.49]; pruritus  0.41 [0.05-3.51]).

METHODS: PUBMED,  EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAT versus dual antiplatelet therapy  (DAT), followed by a manual search. Then, a meta-analysis of RCTs comparing TAT  versus standard DAT in patients undergoing PCI was performed. Furthermore, indirect  comparisons of TAT versus new generation ADP-receptor antagonist based DAT  (prasugrel or ticagrelor based DAT) were undertaken, with standard DAT as a common  comparator. The included end-points were major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE),  target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), death,  myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, bleeding and other drug adverse  events. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs with a total of 31,789 patients were included. Compared  with standard DAT (n = 2551), TAT (n = 2545) significantly reduced the incidence of  MACE (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.47-0.68, P < 0.00001), TLR (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.34-0.75,  P = 0.0006) and TVR (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.46-0.75, P < 0.0001), and did not change  significantly in death (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.44-1.05, P = 0.08), MI (OR: 0.80, 95%  CI: 0.45-1.44, P = 0.46), stent thrombosis (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.27-1.36, P = 0.23),  major bleeding (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 0.52-3.85, P = 0.49) and overall bleeding (OR:  1.16, 95% CI: 0.79-1.69, P = 0.45). Compared with prasugrel (n = 6813) or ticagrelor  based DAT (n = 6732), TAT (n = 2545) further reduced the incidence of MACE (OR:  0.80, 95% CI: 0.72-0.90, P = 0.0012; OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75-0.92, P = 0.0003,  respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with standard DAT, the long-term use of TAT in  patients with PCI gives more benefits in reducing the incidence of MACE, TLR and TVR  without increasing bleeding.

Efficacy and safety were estimated using a common-reference based indirect  comparison meta-analysis (CRBMA) methodology. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials  (RCTs) investigating the use of IV-VPA or IV-PB versus intravenous phenytoin  (IV-PHT) for GCSE were identified by a systematic search of the literature. A random  effects model was used to estimate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs) for efficacy  and safety of IV-VPA or IV-PB versus IV-PHT in a standard meta-analysis. Adjusted  indirect comparisons were then made between VPA and PB using the obtained results.  RESULTS: CRBMA showed that VPA does not lead to significantly higher seizure  cessation (OR 1.00; 95% CI: 0.36-2.76) compared to PB, although it exhibits fewer  adverse effects (OR 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04-0.71). Results of this CRBMA are consistent  with results of a recently published head-to-head comparison of IV-VPA and IV-PB.  CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate superiority of IV-VPA over  IV-PB for the treatment of GCSE in terms of efficacy. Some direct and indirect  comparisons suggest that VPA has a better safety profile than PB.

However, other study  designs or methods could be used to indirectly compare these two medications.  Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) is a recent methodology that utilizes  individual patient data (IPD) from clinical trials for one treatment and published  aggregate data from another treatment to estimate the relative efficacy of both,  providing rapid, reliable comparative efficacy results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this  study was to compare the efficacy of GXR and ATX for the treatment of ADHD using  MAIC. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify ATX and  GXR trials published through December 2012. Studies were selected for MAIC analyses  on the basis of having comparable trial characteristics and study designs. Summary  data from selected ATX trials and IPD from selected GXR trials were used. MAIC  methodology ensured comparable populations: target doses for the 'base case'  comparison were selected on the basis of maximum effective dosage ranges from the US  FDA-approved product labels (GXR 0.09-0.12 mg/kg/day, ATX 1.2 mg/kg/day for children  and adolescents weighing ≤70 kg). Individuals from GXR trials were selected if they  matched inclusion/exclusion criteria from selected ATX trials; selected GXR IPD were  then re-weighted to match the published ATX trial mean baseline characteristics and  placebo outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted, examining different dosage  ranges and repeating the analysis in a larger number of trials, allowing for larger  and more heterogeneous trial populations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome  measure was change in ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score. RESULTS: Using  MAIC in the base case comparison, significantly greater reductions in mean (standard  error; SE) ADHD-RS-IV total scores from baseline to end of study were observed in  patients treated with GXR relative to ATX [-7.0 (2.2); p < 0.01]. Significantly  greater reductions for GXR over ATX were also demonstrated for  hyperactivity/impulsivity [-3.8 (1.2); p < 0.01] and inattention [-3.2 (1.3); p <  0.05] subscales of the ADHD-RS-IV. Similar results were observed in MAIC sensitivity  analyses evaluating other dosage ranges and using more heterogeneous trial  populations (e.g., larger randomized sample, broader subject weight range,  additional trials). Mean (SE) decreases in ADHD-RS-IV total scores were greater for  GXR relative to ATX when including IPD for those administered GXR at lower than  target dosage (0.075-0.090 mg/kg/day) compared with ATX at target dosage (1.2  mg/kg/day), with a relative improvement of -6.0 (2.7) (p < 0.05). Reductions in  ADHD-RS-IV total scores were also greater for GXR in another MAIC examining GXR at  target dosage (0.09-0.12 mg/kg/day) and a broader range of ATX dosages (including  three additional trials evaluating ATX ≥1.2 mg/kg/day); relative improvement for GXR  versus ATX administered at target dosage or higher was -7.6 (1.4) (p < 0.01).  CONCLUSION: After adjusting for difference in baseline trial characteristics using  MAIC, GXR appears to be more efficacious than ATX for the treatment of ADHD. Results  were consistent in a variety of dosage range comparisons and within increasingly  heterogeneous trial populations.",NA,"Sikirica, Vanja Findling, Robert L Signorovitch, James Erder, M Haim Dammerman, Ryan Hodgkins, Paul Lu, Mei Xie, Jipan Wu, Eric Q",Sikirica V Findling RL Signorovitch J Erder MH Dammerman R Hodgkins P Lu M Xie J Wu EQ,NA,"Global Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Shire Development LLC, 725  Chesterbrook Boulevard, Wayne, PA, 19087, USA, vsikirica@shire.com.",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,NA,CNS Drugs,CNS drugs,9431220,IM,NA,NA,2013/08/27 06:00,2014/06/03 06:00,2013/08/27 06:00,2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez] 2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed] 2014/06/03 06:00 [medline],102 [pii] 10.1007/s40263-013-0102-x [doi],ppublish,CNS Drugs. 2013 Nov;27(11):943-53. doi: 10.1007/s40263-013-0102-x.,27,11,943-53,NA,PMC3824845,NA,NA,NA,NA,20140602,0 (Delayed-Action Preparations) 0 (Propylamines) 30OMY4G3MK (Guanfacine) 57WVB6I2W0 (Atomoxetine Hydrochloride),"Adolescent Atomoxetine Hydrochloride Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*drug therapy/psychology Child *Comparative Effectiveness Research Delayed-Action Preparations Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Guanfacine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Humans Propylamines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Psychiatric Status Rating Scales *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data Severity of Illness Index Treatment Outcome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Existing  institutional guidance for conducting indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison  alongside current practice in health technology assessment was reviewed. Reports  published in UK by the Health Technology Assessment programme since 1997, which  utilized indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison methods, were reviewed with  respect to the presentation of study data, statistical models and results.  Recommendations for presentation were developed. RESULTS: Guidance exists that  provide the details necessary to conduct a successful indirect comparison/mixed  treatment comparison analysis but recommendations on presentation are limited. Of  205 health technology assessment reports that contained evidence synthesis for  effectiveness, 19 used indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison methods. These  reports utilized numerous presentational formats from which the following key  components were identified: network table/diagram for presenting data; model  description to allow reproducibility; and tables, forest plots, matrix tables and  summary forest plots for presenting a range of results. Recommendations were  developed to ensure that reporting is explicit, transparent and reproducible.  Approaches most understandable by non-technical decision makers, and areas where  future research is required, are outlined. CONCLUSIONS: There is no standard  presentational style used in UK for reporting indirect comparison/mixed treatment  comparison, and the use of graphical tools is limited.

METHODS: A meta-analysis of trials in which patients were randomly assigned  to PCB versus UCB or BNS versus UCB was performed, as well as an indirect comparison  of PCB versus BNS, with UCB common comparator. The primary endpoint was target  lesion revascularization (TLR); secondary endpoints were restenosis, death and  amputation. RESULTS: In total, 1464 patients were assigned to revascularization with  PCB versus UCB (n = 441) or BNS versus UCB (n = 1023). Treatment with PCB versus UCB  reduced the risk of TLR (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.29 [0.15-0.56], p  < 0.001) and restenosis (0.31 [0.19-0.51], p < 0.001) without affecting mortality  (1.05 [0.41-2.71], p = 0.92) or amputation (0.68 [0.04-10.31], p = 0.78). BNS versus  UCB therapy reduced the risk of TLR (0.46 [0.27-0.80], p = 0.006) and restenosis  (0.51 [0.34-0.77], p = 0.02) without affecting mortality (2.08 [0.93-4.66], p =  0.07) or amputation (0.84 [0.30-2.35], p = 0.74).

METHODS: Randomized, controlled trials evaluating PGA for  the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension were identified by a  systematic literature review in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials  Register (up to December 2011) databases. The effect size for each treatment and  heterogeneity were assessed by classical pairwise meta-analysis (direct  comparisons). Adjusted indirect comparisons were performed by using Bucher method.  The main endpoints were intraocular pressure (IOP) measured at 3 months and  incidence of hyperemia. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the  meta-analysis. No statistically significant differences in IOP at 3 months were seen  between T2345 and travoprost [preserved with benzalkonium chloride (BAK),  polyquaternium-1 or sofzia], and other BAK-preserved PGA: bimatoprost 0.03%,  bimatoprost 0.01%, or latanoprost. T2345 was statistically significantly superior to  BAK-tafluprost (mean difference: 0.47 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval,  [-1.52;-0.28]). The risk of hyperemia was statistically significantly lower with  T2345 than with all the other PGA. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons never found  preservative-free latanoprost (T2345) to be statistically significantly inferior to  the other PGA in terms of efficacy on IOP and showed statistically significant  superiority over BAK-tafluprost.

There are inherent challenges with both treatments, including  variable and inconsistent benefit and increased bleeding risks. The availability of  new anticoagulants offers some alternatives. OBJECTIVE: A mixed treatment comparison  meta-analysis to evaluate direct and indirect treatment data including aspirin,  warfarin apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban for the prevention of  primary or secondary stroke in patients with AF. METHODS: A comprehensive,  systematic literature search was conducted to identify randomized trials comparing  aspirin, warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in patients with  AF requiring treatment for stroke prevention. Open-label and blinded designs were  included if they evaluated any stroke or any bleeding event. Data on stroke and  bleeding events were abstracted, verified, evaluated, scored, and entered into  Aggregate Data Drug Information System version 1.16 to generate a mixed treatment  comparison meta-analysis. Direct and indirect comparisons were evaluated, and we  looked for inconsistency in closed loop structures. Data are reported as rate ratios  with 95% credible intervals. In addition, we reviewed variance statistics and  explored variance with node-splitting models. RESULTS: Our literature search yielded  30 articles, 21 of which were included. All treatments except aspirin reduced the  risk of any stroke compared with placebo. Warfarin (0.43 [0.33-0.57]), apixaban  (0.37 [0.27-0.54]), dabigatran (0.34 [0.21-0.57]), rivaroxaban (0.36 [0.22-0.60]),  and aspirin with clopidogrel (0.73 [0.53-0.99]) were more protective than aspirin  alone. Warfarin and the new anticoagulants were similar in the reduction of stroke,  vascular death, and mortality. There was no difference in major bleeding between any  treatment group. There were more nonmajor bleeding events when comparing warfarin  and apixaban (1.83 [1.05-4.03]); no other differences between warfarin and the other  new anticoagulants were found. CONCLUSIONS: This mixed treatment comparison  meta-analysis found similarity between warfarin and the new anticoagulants with the  exception of one comparison, in which warfarin was associated with more non-major  bleeding than apixaban. Thus, the new anticoagulants are therapeutically comparable  when warfarin is inappropriate.","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

The recurrence risk of S-1 was  slightly higher as compared to XELOX, but no statistical difference was found  (HR=1.11, 95%CI:0.80-1.53, P=0.54).

Both dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole are an enantiomer of  lansoprazole and omeprazole respectively. However, there is no head-to-head trial  data or indirect comparison analyses between dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole. AIM:  To compare the efficacy of dexlansoprazole with esomeprazole in healing erosive  oesophagitis (EO), the maintenance of healed EO and the treatment of non-erosive  reflux disease (NERD). METHODS: Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing  dexlansoprazole or esomeprazole with either placebo or another PPI were  systematically reviewed. Random-effect meta-analyses and adjusted indirect  comparisons were conducted to compare the treatment effect of dexlansoprazole and  esomeprazole using a common comparator. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence  interval (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: The indirect comparisons revealed  significant differences in symptom control of heartburn in patients with NERD at 4  weeks. Dexlansoprazole 30 mg was more effective than esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg  (RR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.15-3.51; RR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.39-3.38). However, there were no  statistically significant differences between the two drugs in EO healing and  maintenance of healed EO. Comparison of symptom control in healed EO was not able to  be made due to different definitions used in the RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted  indirect comparisons based on currently available RCT data suggested significantly  better treatment effect in symptom control of heartburn in patients with NERD for  dexlansoprazole against esomeprazole. No statistically significant differences were  found in other EO outcomes.

Studies  often ignore chronicity by reporting short-duration outcomes and fail to account for  medication tolerability. We assessed efficacy of oral medications on chronic  peripheral neuropathic pain. METHODS: Relevant published, English-language,  randomized controlled trials administering oral medications for peripheral  neuropathic pain were identified through MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 1, 2012), EMBASE (1980  to December 2012), the Cochrane Library Databases (through December 2012), and the  Oxford Pain Relief Database (through 2012). Included studies reported end point pain  or pain reduction from baseline on an 11-point scale (0-10); had active  treatment ≥ 12 weeks; reported an intention-to-treat analysis, and had 5-point  quality score ≥ 3. Abstracted information included patient characteristics,  neuropathic pain condition, drug and dosage arms, adverse events rates causing  dropout, and secondary measures (50% pain improvement, global improvement, and sleep  interference). Primary outcome meta-analysis, stratified by drug and dosage, was  followed by an indirect treatment comparison adjusting for study dropouts due to  adverse events. RESULTS: Seventeen studies comprised of 5,975 subjects, totaling 38  active trial arms evaluating 7 drugs, and 17 drug-dosing combinations met inclusion  criteria. Mean pain reduction over placebo ranked highest for duloxetine 120 mg  (1.17 95% CI 0.77, 1.58) and pregabalin 600 mg (1.11 95% CI 0.77, 1.45). The  Indirect treatment comparison showed largest effect size for duloxetine at 120 and  60 mg followed by pregabalin 600 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Pregabalin and duloxetine had the  largest beneficial effects for chronic peripheral neuropathic pain. In the absence  of head-to-head trials, meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparisons inform best  practice clinical decision-making.","Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Ney, John Peter Devine, Emily Beth Watanabe, Jonathan H Sullivan, Sean D",Ney JP Devine EB Watanabe JH Sullivan SD,NA,"Comparative Effectiveness, Cost and Outcomes Research Center, University of  Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA. neyj@uw.edu",eng,5K08 HS014739/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States,"Comparative Study Journal Article Meta-Analysis Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",20130422,England,Pain Med,"Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",100894201,IM,NA,NA,2013/05/23 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez] 2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed] 2014/01/15 06:00 [medline],10.1111/pme.12091 [doi],ppublish,Pain Med. 2013 May;14(5):706-19. doi: 10.1111/pme.12091.

Subsequently, a number of nonrandomised  studies have shown statins improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure  (HF). Small randomised controlled trials (RCT) also show improved cardiac function,  reduced inflammation and mortality with statins in HF. However, the findings of two  large RCTs do not support the evidence provided by previous studies and suggest  statins lack beneficial effects in HF. Two meta-analyses have shown statins do not  improve survival, whereas two others showed improved cardiac function and reduced  inflammation in HF. It appears lipophilic statins produce better survival and other  outcome benefits compared to hydrophilic statins. But the two types have not been  compared in direct comparison trials in HF. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a  systematic review and meta-analysis of lipophilic and hydrophilic statin therapy in  patients with HF. Our objectives are:1. To determine the effects of lipophilic  statins on (1) mortality, (2) hospitalisation for worsening HF, (3) cardiac function  and (4) inflammation.2. To determine the effects of hydrophilic statins on (1)  mortality, (2) hospitalisation for worsening HF, (3) cardiac function and (4)  inflammation.3. To compare the efficacy of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins on HF  outcomes with an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis.We will conduct an  electronic search of databases for RCTs that evaluate statins in patients with HF.  The reference lists of all identified studies will be reviewed. Two independent  reviewers will conduct the search. The inclusion criteria include:1. RCTs comparing  statins with placebo or no statin in patients with symptomatic HF.2. RCTs that  employed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle in data analysis.3. Symptomatic HF  patients of all aetiologies and on standard treatment.4. Statin of any dose as  intervention.5. Placebo or no statin arm as control.The exclusion criteria  include:1. RCTs involving cerivastatin in HF patients.2. RCTs with less than 4 weeks  of follow-up.

This review provides an introduction to, and overview of, common methods  used for comparing drugs in the absence of head-to-head clinical trial evidence.  Naïve direct comparisons are in most instances inappropriate and should only be used  for exploratory purposes and when no other options are possible. Adjusted indirect  comparisons are currently the most commonly accepted method and use links through  one or more common comparators. Mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) use Bayesian  statistical models to incorporate all available data for a drug, even data that are  not relevant to the comparator drug.

Anti-TNF drugs reduce  the severity of the disease in the long term. This study compares the efficacy and  safety of adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and golimumab in patients with  psoriatic arthritis. METHODS: Direct comparison was based on a literature search of  drug comparison studies, whereas indirect treatment comparison was based on phase  III clinical trials with biological agents, involving similar populations and  durations, and with the same outcome. ACR50 was taken as primary outcome for  comparison, whereas ACR20 and ACR70 were used as secondary outcomes. Indirect  comparisons were made using infliximab as the reference drug and the Bucher method.  In calculating δ (the maximum acceptable difference as a clinical criterion of  equivalence), use was made of half of the absolute risk reduction obtained in the  meta-analysis of the clinical trials included in the indirect comparison (ARR 32%;  δ: 16%). The four anti-TNF drugs were also compared in relation to the secondary  outcomes and adverse effects. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Reported direct and indirect  comparisons of the four drugs did not include golimumab, and did not yield  conclusive results. Four clinical trials - one for each drug studied - were  identified. The estimated differences for the primary outcome, ACR50, between  infliximab and the other drugs were adalimumab (ARR 4%, 95% CI -9·5 to 17·5),  etanercept (ARR 4%, 95% CI -10·5 to 18·5) and golimumab (ARR 9%, 95% CI -5·4 to  23·4). Likewise, there were no relevant differences between the drugs in relation to  the secondary efficacy outcomes, except for etanercept, which was less effective in  ACR70 response. For adverse reactions, there were also no significant differences  except for injection site, reactions which were more frequent with etanercept, with  a mean difference of 26% relative to infliximab. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: No  significant differences were found in ACR50 responses to the four drugs after  24 weeks. Injection-site reactions were more common with etanercept, but this was  insufficient to invalidate the inference that clinically the four drugs can be  regarded as clinically equivalent for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.",© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"Fénix-Caballero, S Alegre-del Rey, E J Castaño-Lara, R Puigventós-Latorre, F Borrero-Rubio, J M López-Vallejo, J F",Fénix-Caballero S Alegre-del Rey EJ Castaño-Lara R Puigventós-Latorre F Borrero-Rubio JM López-Vallejo JF,NA,"Pharmacy Department, Puerto Real Universitary Hospital, Cádiz, Spain.  silvia.fenix@yahoo.es",eng,NA,Journal Article Meta-Analysis Review,20130417,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,IM,NOTNLM,adalimumab etanercept golimumab infliximab psoriatic arthritis therapeutic equivalent,2013/04/18 06:00,2014/02/28 06:00,2013/04/18 06:00,2012/05/15 00:00 [received] 2012/12/19 00:00 [accepted] 2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez] 2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed] 2014/02/28 06:00 [medline],10.1111/jcpt.12045 [doi],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2013 Aug;38(4):286-93. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.12045.

The  assessment was based on patient-relevant outcomes. The company did not identify any  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with direct comparisons of ingenol mebutate gel  and diclofenac / hyaluronic acid gel. It therefore aimed at determining the added  benefit on the basis of indirect comparisons. For both ingenol mebutate gel and  diclofenac / hyaluronic acid gel, the company identified studies comparing the  intervention therapy with a vehicle gel that did not contain ingenol mebutate gel or  diclofenac. The company assumed that the hyaluronic acid gel itself, which served as  vehicle in the diclofenac/hyaluronic acid studies, had an effect on actinic  keratosis, whereas the drug-free vehicle gel in the ingenol mebutate studies did  not. It therefore rejected an adjusted indirect comparison with vehicle gel as  intermediate comparator. Instead, it chose a method called ""chaining of direct  comparisons"" for the indirect comparison (comparison of ingenol mebutate gel versus  vehicle gel, vehicle gel versus hyaluronic acid gel, and hyaluronic acid gel versus  diclofenac / hyaluronic acid gel on the basis of the studies mentioned above). A  comparison of ingenol mebutate vehicle and hyaluronic acid gel conducted in RCTs  would have been necessary, however, to draw a valid conclusion on added benefit on  the basis of the method chosen by the company. The company did not identify such  studies. Groups with drug-free vehicle gel from different studies were compared in  one step of the method. This was an unadjusted indirect comparison, which rendered  randomization ineffective. Unadjusted indirect comparisons do not constitute a valid  method of analysis, however. Moreover, the company included 2 non-randomized  comparative studies on ingenol mebutate versus drug-free vehicle gel in the  assessment of the outcome ""recurrence rate"".

METHODS: C. albicans was  used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of four varieties of  Algerian honey. Lower concentrations of honey than the MIC were incubated with a set  of concentrations of starch and then added to media to determine the minimum  additive inhibitory concentration (MAIC). RESULTS: The MIC for the four varieties of  honey without starch against C. albicans ranged between 38% and 42% (v/v).

Both subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual  immunotherapy (SLIT) have demonstrated effectiveness in this patient group; however,  it remains uncertain which route of administration is more effective. OBJECTIVES: We  sought to update existing systematic reviews on the clinical effectiveness of SCIT  and SLIT versus placebo, to undertake a systematic review of head-to-head trials,  and to compare the relative effectiveness of SCIT and SLIT in an adjusted indirect  comparison. METHODS: Standard systematic review methods aimed at minimizing bias  were used. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of SCIT or SLIT or  trials of SCIT versus SLIT were included. Meta-analysis and indirect comparison  meta-analysis with meta-regression were performed. RESULTS: Updated meta-analyses  confirmed statistically significant benefits for SCIT and SLIT compared with placebo  in adults and, to a lesser extent, in children. Only 1 head-to-head trial met the  inclusion criteria; both this and the indirect comparisons did not provide  conclusive results in favor of either SCIT or SLIT based on symptom-medication or  quality-of-life scores. There was a trend toward favoring SCIT for symptom and  medication scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is clear evidence of effectiveness of  both SCIT and SLIT, superiority of one mode of administration over the other could  not be consistently demonstrated through indirect comparison, and further research  is needed to establish the comparative effectiveness of SCIT versus SLIT.","Copyright © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The choice of  enoxaparin comparator may influence the perceived relative efficacy and safety of  the newer agents, and we aimed to identify any significant differences between the  two enoxaparin regimens. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library  for randomized controlled trials that compared enoxaparin to oral anticoagulant  (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban) thromboprophylaxis in elective total knee or hip  arthroplasty. Total VTE and bleeding events were pooled using fixed-effects  meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessed with the I2 statistic. We conducted  adjusted indirect comparisons of bid vs once-daily enoxaparin regimes based on new  oral anticoagulants as common comparators. RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled  trials in hip and knee replacement surgery met the inclusion criteria. Adjusted  indirect comparison showed that bid enoxaparin was significantly more effective in  preventing VTE than enoxaparin once daily (relative risk [RR], 0.71; 95% CI,  0.61-0.83; P &lt; .00001). For major and clinically relevant hemorrhage, adjusted  indirect comparison showed that enoxaparin bid was nonsignificantly associated with  increased risk of bleeding (RR 1.27; 95% CI, 0.97-1.65; P = .08) above that of  enoxaparin once daily. Subgroup analysis limited to total knee arthroplasty trials  showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The use of once-daily enoxaparin regimen as  control in clinical trials will lead to more favorable estimates of relative  efficacy for the new oral anticoagulants than if enoxaparin 30 mg bid had been  chosen as a comparator.",NA,"Kwok, Chun Shing Pradhan, Shiva Yeong, Jessica Ka-Yan Loke, Yoon K",Kwok CS Pradhan S Yeong JK Loke YK,NA,"Medical Division, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals National Health Service  Foundation Trust, Norfolk, England; Population Health Group, Norwich Medical School,  University of East Anglia, Norfolk, England.

However, appropriate selection of prior distributions for unknown model  parameters and checking of consistency assumptions required for feasible modeling  remain particularly challenging. We compared Bayesian and traditional frequentist  statistical methods for multiple treatment comparisons in the context of  pharmacological treatments for female urinary incontinence (UI). DATA SOURCES: We  searched major electronic bibliographic databases, U.S. Food and Drug Administration  reviews, trial registries, and research grant databases up to November 2011 to find  randomized studies published in English that examined drugs for urgency UI on  continence, improvements in UI, and treatment discontinuation due to harms. REVIEW  METHODS: We fitted fixed and random effects models in frequentist and Bayesian  frameworks. In a hierarchical model of eight treatments, we separately analyzed one  safety and two efficacy outcomes. We produced Bayesian and frequentist treatment  ranks and odds ratios (and associated measures of uncertainty) across all bivariate  treatment comparisons. We also calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) to  achieve continence or avoid harms from pooled absolute risk differences. RESULTS:  While frequentist and Bayesian analyses produced broadly comparable odds ratios of  safety and efficacy, the Bayesian method's ability to deliver the probability that  any treatment is best, or among the top two such treatments, offered a more  meaningful clinical interpretation. In our study, two drugs emerged as attractive  because while neither had any significant chance of being among the least safe  drugs, both had greater than 50 percent chances of being among the top three drugs  in terms of Best12 probability for one of the efficacy endpoints. CONCLUSIONS:  Bayesian methods are more flexible and their results more clinically interpretable  but require more careful development and specialized software. KEY MESSAGES: Both  Bayesian and frequentist hierarchical models can be effective in multiple treatment  comparisons. Bayesian models sensibly shrink estimates towards each other,  encouraging more borrowing of statistical strength from the entire collection of  studies. Bayesian methods also lead to more clinically interpretable results  (through their ability to assign probabilities to events), as well as more sensible  rankings of the pharmacological treatments as compared to traditional NNT-based  methods. Further development of hierarchical Bayesian multiple treatment comparison  methods is warranted, especially for nonbinary data models, simultaneous  decisionmaking across multiple endpoints, assessing consistency, and incorporating  data sources of varying quality (e.g., clinical vs. observational data).",NA,"Carlin, Bradley P Hong, Hwanhee Shamliyan, Tatyana A Sainfort, François Kane, Robert L",Carlin BP Hong H Shamliyan TA Sainfort F Kane RL,NA,Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center,eng,NA,Review Book,NA,Rockville (MD),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2013/03/01 00:00,NA,2013/03/01 00:00,NA,NBK132729 [bookaccession],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US),AHRQ Methods for Effective Health Care,Case Study Comparing Bayesian and Frequentist Approaches for Multiple Treatment  Comparisons,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Biological agents (ustekinumab,  adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept) are indicated for moderate-to-severe  plaque-type psoriasis in adults who fail to respond to, have a contraindication to,  or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including cyclosporine, methotrexate  and PUVA Unfortunately, with new drugs, the pivotal trials leading to their  licensing are often placebo-controlled trials rather than comparative trials vs.  established therapies. Therefore, inference on comparative effectiveness of the  newer agents must be derived indirectly, through estimation of effects of the new  agents vs. a common comparator. The objective of this study is to compare the  relative efficacy of the biological agents through a systematic review of the  indirect clinical trial evidence. METHODS: A systematic literature search was  performed for clinical trials of biological agents in psoriasis. Pivotal,  randomized, double-blind, controlled (placebo) trials using intention-to-treat  analysis were selected for detailed analysis. Trials must include PASI 75 as a  primary end point. The indirect comparison was performed using the method of Bucher  adjusted with the ITC calculator (Indirect Treatment Comparisons of the Canadian  Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health), etanercept being the reference drug.  We defined delta value for therapeutic equivalence as a difference in the efficacy  of 25% among the different treatment options. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fourteen  studies (four for ustekinumab, three for adalimumab, three for infliximab and four  for etanercept) were included. The indirect comparison results reveal that  ustekinumab, adalimumab and infliximab were statistically superior to etanercept  with an absolute risk difference for PASI 75 of 12% (95% CI = 5·9-18%), 11% (95%  CI = 5·3-16·7%) and 24% (29·7-18·3%) respectively. However, in all situations, the  95% confidence interval does not achieve clinical relevance as no delta exceeds the  previously set value (25%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Ustekinumab, adalimumab,  infliximab and etanercept can be regarded as clinical equivalents for the treatment  of psoriasis. Choice between these agents therefore depends on their relative safety  profiles, individual contra-indications and cost effectiveness.",© 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.,"Galván-Banqueri, M Marín Gil, R Santos Ramos, B Bautista Paloma, F J",Galván-Banqueri M Marín Gil R Santos Ramos B Bautista Paloma FJ,NA,"Andalusian Public Foundation for the Management of Health Research, Sevilla, Spain.  mercedes.galvan.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es",eng,NA,Journal Article,20130226,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,IM,NA,NA,2013/02/28 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,2012/10/16 00:00 [received] 2012/12/12 00:00 [accepted] 2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez] 2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed] 2014/01/15 06:00 [medline],10.1111/jcpt.12044 [doi],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2013 Apr;38(2):121-30. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.12044.

This study implements a  matching-adjusted indirect comparison technique to address that gap. METHODS:  Patient-level data from a placebo-controlled trial of adalimumab (ADEPT) were  re-weighted to match average baseline characteristics from pivotal published trials  of etanercept and infliximab. ADEPT patients were re-weighted by odds of enrollment  in comparator trials, estimated using logistic regression. Matched-on  characteristics included PsA duration, age, gender, severity, active psoriasis, and  concomitant treatment. After matching, placebo-adjusted treatment arms were compared  at weeks 12 (or 14) and 24. Outcomes included ACR20/50/70, PsARC, HAQ, and modified  TSS. PASI50/75/90 were compared for patients with active psoriasis. Cost per  responder (CPR) was assessed in the US and Germany using matching-adjusted  end-points and drug list prices. Statistical significance was assessed using  weighted t-tests. RESULTS: After matching, adalimumab-treated patients had greater  placebo-adjusted rates of ACR70 and PASI50/75/90 at week 24 compared with etanercept  (all p < 0.05). Adalimumab patients had a higher placebo-adjusted rate of ACR70 than  infliximab at week 14 (p = 0.034). Adalimumab treatment had lower CPR for ACR70 and  PASI50/75/90 compared with etanercept at week 24, in both the US and Germany (all  p < 0.02). Adalimumab had lower CPR than infliximab for all outcomes at week 24 (all  p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Adalimumab is associated with higher ACR70 and PASI50/75/90  response rates than etanercept at week 24 and a higher ACR70 response rate than  infliximab at week 14. Adalimumab has significant advantages over etanercept and  infliximab in CPR across multiple end-points.

METHODS: We  searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for interventions which have been  used for CIN. We included only the most recent meta-analysis of each intervention.  We extracted data on the methodology, quality and results of each meta-analysis. We  performed narrative synthesis and adjusted indirect comparison of interventions that  were shown to be statistically significant compared with a placebo. RESULTS: We  included 7 systematic reviews and meta-analyses involving 9 different interventions  for CIN, with a total of 15 976 participants. A significantly decreased risk of CIN  was reported in meta-analysis of the following interventions: N-acetylcysteine [odds  ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.88, I(2)=64%], theophylline  [relative risk (RR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.26-0.89, I(2)=44%], statins (RR 0.51, 95% CI  0.34-0.77, I(2)=0%) and sodium bicarbonate (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.86, I(2)=49%).  Furosemide was shown to increase the risk of CIN (RR 3.27, 95% CI 1.48-7.26,  I(2)=0%). Other interventions such as renal replacement therapy,  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dopamine and fenoldapam failed to show any  significant difference from the control group. CONCLUSION: Although there is some  evidence to suggest that N-acetylcysteine, theophylline, sodium bicarbonate and  statins may reduce incidence of CIN, limitations in the study quality and  heterogeneity preclude any firm recommendations. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE:  N-acetylcysteine, theophylline, sodium bicarbonate and statins show some promise as  potentially efficacious agents for preventing CIN, but more high-quality studies are  needed before they can be recommended for use in routine practice.",NA,"Kwok, C S Pang, C L Yeong, J K Loke, Y K",Kwok CS Pang CL Yeong JK Loke YK,NA,"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, UK. shingkwok@doctors.org.uk",eng,NA,Comparative Study Journal Article Meta-Analysis Review,NA,NA,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,IM,NA,NA,2012/12/15 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00 [entrez] 2012/12/15 06:00 [pubmed] 2013/02/07 06:00 [medline],86/1021/20120272 [pii] D12272 [pii] 10.1259/bjr.20120272 [doi],ppublish,Br J Radiol. 2013 Jan;86(1021):20120272. doi: 10.1259/bjr.20120272.,86,1021,20120272,NA,PMC3615404,NA,NA,NA,NA,20130206,0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors) 8MDF5V39QO (Sodium Bicarbonate) C137DTR5RG (Theophylline) WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine),Acetylcysteine/*therapeutic use Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*drug therapy/*epidemiology Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/therapeutic use Kidney Diseases/*drug therapy/*epidemiology Prevalence Risk Assessment Sodium Bicarbonate/*therapeutic use Theophylline/*therapeutic use Treatment Outcome,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This was based on demonstration of bioequivalence with  the reference product (Prograf, Astellas Pharma), which makes these generic  tacrolimus products prescribable, switchable and therapeutically equivalent to the  reference product; yet, according to Spanish legislation, only prescribers can  switch tacrolimus-containing products. METHODS: Data from independent bioequivalence  studies that compare each generic product with the reference product were combined  by adjusted indirect comparisons to investigate the relative bioavailability between  generic drug products, since there is no direct bioequivalence study comparing  generics to each other. RESULTS: Eight generic tacrolimus products in the form of  capsules are presently authorized in Spain, but only five are marketed. These eight  products represent only three different generic product developments. One product is  authorized with four different names/companies, while another is authorized under  three different names/companies. The adjusted indirect comparisons between generic  products show bioequivalence within the conventional 80-125 % confidence interval  acceptance criteria for area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax).

This study evaluated a Trial  Similarity and Evidence Consistency Assessment (TSECA) framework for assessing key  assumptions underlying the validity of indirect comparisons. STUDY DESIGN AND  SETTING: We applied the TSECA framework to 94 Cochrane Systematic Reviews that  provided data to compare two interventions by both direct and indirect comparisons.  Using the TSECA framework, two reviewers independently assessed and scored trial  similarity and evidence consistency. A detailed case study provided further insight  into the usefulness and limitations of the framework proposed. RESULTS: Trial  similarity and evidence consistency scores obtained using the assessment framework  were not associated with statistically significant inconsistency between direct and  indirect estimates. The case study illustrated that the assessment framework could  be used to identify potentially important differences in participants,  interventions, and outcome measures between different sets of trials in the indirect  comparison. CONCLUSION: Although the overall trial similarity and evidence  consistency scores are unlikely to be sufficiently accurate for predicting  inconsistency between direct and indirect estimates, the assessment framework  proposed in this study can be a useful tool for identifying between-trial  differences that may threaten the validity of indirect treatment comparisons.",Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of evergreening  through the case study of the antidepressant citalopram and its chiral switch form  escitalopram by evaluating treatment efficacy and acceptability for patients, as  well as health insurance costs for society. METHODS: To assess efficacy and  acceptability, we performed meta-analyses for efficacy and acceptability. We  compared direct evidence (meta-analysis of results of head-to-head trials) and  indirect evidence (adjusted indirect comparison of results of placebo-controlled  trials). To assess health insurance costs, we analyzed individual reimbursement data  from a representative sample of the French National Health Insurance Inter-regime  Information System (SNIIR-AM) from 2003 to 2010, which allowed for projecting these  results to the whole SNIIR-AM population (53 million people). RESULTS: In the  meta-analysis of seven head-to-head trials (2,174 patients), efficacy was  significantly better for escitalopram than citalopram (combined odds ratio (OR) 1.60  (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.46)). However, for the adjusted indirect  comparison of 10 citalopram and 12 escitalopram placebo-controlled trials, 2,984 and  3,777 patients respectively, efficacy was similar for the two drug forms (combined  indirect OR 1.03 (0.82 to 1.30)). Because of the discrepancy, we could not combine  direct and indirect data (test of inconsistency, P = 0.07). A similar discrepancy  was found for treatment acceptability. The overall reimbursement cost burden for the  citalopram, escitalopram and its generic forms was 120.6 million Euros in 2010, with  96.8 million Euros for escitalopram. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefit of  escitalopram versus citalopram remains uncertain. In our case of evergreening,  escitalopram represented a substantially high proportion of the overall  reimbursement cost burden as compared with citalopram and the generic forms.",NA,"Alkhafaji, Ali A Trinquart, Ludovic Baron, Gabriel Desvarieux, Moïse Ravaud, Philippe",Alkhafaji AA Trinquart L Baron G Desvarieux M Ravaud P,NA,"Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de  Paris, 1 place du parvis Notre Dame, Paris, 75004, France.",eng,NA,Journal Article Meta-Analysis,20121120,NA,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,IM,NA,NA,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/03/07 06:00,2012/11/22 06:00,2012/07/11 00:00 [received] 2012/11/20 00:00 [accepted] 2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez] 2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed] 2013/03/07 06:00 [medline],1741-7015-10-142 [pii] 10.1186/1741-7015-10-142 [doi],epublish,BMC Med. 2012 Nov 20;10:142. doi: 10.1186/1741-7015-10-142.,10,NA,142,NA,PMC3520785,NA,NA,NA,Evid Based Ment Health. 2013 May;16(2):51.

Our aim was to  review existing quantitative approaches for benefit-harm assessment and to develop  an organizing framework that clarifies differences and aids selection of  quantitative approaches for a particular benefit-harm assessment. METHODS: We  performed a review of the literature to identify quantitative approaches for  benefit-harm assessment. Our team, consisting of clinicians, epidemiologists, and  statisticians, discussed the approaches and identified their key characteristics. We  developed a framework that helps investigators select quantitative approaches for  benefit-harm assessment that are appropriate for a particular decisionmaking  context. RESULTS: Our framework for selecting quantitative approaches requires a  concise definition of the treatment comparison and population of interest,  identification of key benefit and harm outcomes, and determination of the need for a  measure that puts all outcomes on a single scale (which we call a benefit and harm  comparison metric). We identified 16 quantitative approaches for benefit-harm  assessment. These approaches can be categorized into those that consider single or  multiple key benefit and harm outcomes, and those that use a benefit-harm comparison  metric or not. Most approaches use aggregate data and can be used in the context of  single studies or systematic reviews. Although the majority of approaches provides a  benefit and harm comparison metric, only four approaches provide measures of  uncertainty around the benefit and harm comparison metric (such as a 95 percent  confidence interval). None of the approaches considers the actual joint distribution  of benefit and harm outcomes, but one approach considers competing risks when  calculating profile-specific event rates. Nine approaches explicitly allow  incorporating patient preferences. CONCLUSION: The choice of quantitative approaches  depends on the specific question and goal of the benefit-harm assessment as well as  on the nature and availability of data. In some situations, investigators may  identify only one appropriate approach. In situations where the question and  available data justify more than one approach, investigators may want to use  multiple approaches and compare the consistency of results. When more evidence on  relative advantages of approaches accumulates from such comparisons, it will be  possible to make more specific recommendations on the choice of approaches.",NA,"Puhan, Milo A Singh, Sonal Weiss, Carlos O Varadhan, Ravi Boyd, Cynthia M",Puhan MA Singh S Weiss CO Varadhan R Boyd CM,NA,"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 615 North Wolfe Street, Room E6153,  Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. mpuhan@jhsph.edu",eng,K23 AG032910/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

An adjusted indirect  comparison was performed to compare between novel oral anticoagulants. DATA SOURCES:  Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to April 2012). Hand searching  of relevant scientific works and contact with experts. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised  controlled trials of novel oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists  for acute venous thromboembolism. Selected outcomes were recurrent events, major  bleeding, and all cause mortality. RESULTS: Nine studies met our inclusion criteria,  involving 16,701 patients evaluated for efficacy and 16,611 for safety. Data were  stratified according to different novel oral anticoagulants. For recurrent acute  venous thromboembolism, there were no significant differences in events rates  between any of the anticoagulants and conventional treatment (rivaroxaban (four  studies): relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.31; dabigatran (two  studies): 1.09, 0.76 to 1.57; ximelagatran (two studies): 1.06, 0.62 to 1.80; and  apixaban (one study): 0.98, 0.20 to 4.79). Rivaroxaban reduced the risk of major  bleeding compared with conventional treatment (0.57, 0.39 to 0.84), whereas other  novel oral anticoagulants did not (0.76 (0.49 to 1.18) for dabigatran; 0.54 (0.28 to  1.03) for ximelagatran; 2.95 (0.12 to 71.82) for apixaban). For all cause mortality  there were no significant differences between the novel oral anticoagulants and  conventional treatment (0.96 (0.72 to 1.27) for rivaroxaban; 1.00 (0.67 to 1.50) for  dabigatran; 0.67 (0.42 to 1.08) for ximelagatran; 6.89 (0.36 to 132.06) for  apixaban). The adjusted indirect comparison between rivaroxaban and dabigatran did  not show superiority of either drug over the others for major bleeding (0.75, 0.41  to 1.34) or the other endpoints.

A secondary objective was to do the same analysis  in the primary prevention cohort. DESIGN: Indirect treatment comparisons of phase  III clinical trials of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, with a focus on the  secondary prevention cohorts. A secondary analysis was done on the primary  prevention cohort. DATA SOURCES: Medline and Central (up to June 2012), clinical  trials registers, conference proceedings, and websites of regulatory agencies. STUDY  SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials of rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or apixaban  compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: In the  secondary prevention (previous stroke) subgroup, when apixaban was compared with  dabigatran (110 mg and 150 mg twice daily) for efficacy and safety endpoints, the  only significant difference seen was less myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 0.39,  95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.95) with apixaban compared with dabigatran 150 mg  twice daily. No significant differences were seen in efficacy and most safety  endpoints between apixaban or dabigatran 150 mg twice daily versus rivaroxaban. Less  haemorrhagic stroke (hazard ratio 0.15, 0.03 to 0.66), vascular death (0.64, 0.42 to  0.99), major bleeding (0.68, 0.47 to 0.99), and intracranial bleeding (0.27, 0.10 to  0.73) were seen with dabigatran 110 mg twice daily versus rivaroxaban. In the  primary prevention (no previous stroke) subgroup, apixaban was superior to  dabigatran 110 mg twice daily for disabling or fatal stroke (hazard ratio 0.59, 0.36  to 0.97). Compared with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, apixaban was associated with  more stroke (hazard ratio 1.45, 1.01 to 2.08) and with less major bleeding (0.75,  0.60 to 0.94), gastrointestinal bleeding (0.61, 0.42 to 0.89), and other location  bleeding (0.74, 0.58 to 0.94). Compared with rivaroxaban, dabigatran 110 mg twice  daily was associated with more myocardial infarction events. No significant  differences were seen for the main efficacy and safety endpoints between dabigatran  150 mg twice daily and rivaroxaban, or in efficacy endpoints between apixaban and  rivaroxaban. Apixaban was associated with less major bleeding (hazard ratio 0.61,  0.48 to 0.78) than rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS: For secondary prevention, apixaban,  rivaroxaban, and dabigatran had broadly similar efficacy for the main endpoints,  although the endpoints of haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death, major bleeding, and  intracranial bleeding were less common with dabigatran 110 mg twice daily than with  rivaroxaban.

Patients with ADHD who  are intolerant of or do not have an optimal response to stimulants often use  non-stimulants as alternative therapies. Guanfacine extended-release (GXR) and  atomoxetine (ATX) are the only non-stimulants approved by the US Food and Drug  Administration for once-daily use in the treatment of children and adolescents with  ADHD in the US. ATX has been on the market since 2002 while GXR was recently  approved in 2009. To date, there is no comparative effectiveness or  cost-effectiveness study comparing the two drugs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study  was to assess the cost effectiveness of GXR versus ATX for the treatment of ADHD in  children and adolescents, using the comparative efficacy results from a  matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). METHODS: The MAIC method was used to  compare the efficacy between GXR (target dose and lower doses) and ATX (target dose)  in the absence of head-to-head clinical trials. Individual patients in the GXR  trials were weighted such that the summary baseline characteristics and the efficacy  of the placebo arm of the GXR trials matched exactly with those from published ATX  trials. After weighting, the efficacy (i.e. change in the ADHD rating scale, fourth  edition [ADHD-RS-IV] total score from baseline) was compared between each GXR dosing  group and the ATX group. The results from the MAIC analyses were used to populate a  1-year Markov model that is used to compare the cost effectiveness of GXR versus ATX  from a US third-party payer perspective. Effectiveness outcomes for each treatment  group were estimated as the proportion of responders, defined as patients with ≥25%  reduction in ADHD-RS-IV total score from baseline, and average quality-adjusted life  years (QALYs). Utilities associated with response/non-response and disutilities due  to adverse events were applied in the model. Costs included drug and medical service  costs and were inflated to 2011 US dollars ($US). Incremental cost/QALY and  incremental cost/responder were estimated. Univariate sensitivity analyses were  conducted by varying all model parameters, including costs, utilities, and response  rate. RESULTS: The target dose of GXR was 0.12 mg/kg/day. In match-adjusted  populations with balanced baseline characteristics, patients receiving GXR at the  dose of 0.09-0.12(p = 0.0016) [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] and 0.075-0.09 mg/kg/day  (p = 0.0248) had better efficacy, while those receiving GXR at the dose of  0.046-0.075 mg/kg/day had comparable efficacy (p = 0.0699), compared with patients  receiving ATX at the target dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day. In the base case of the  cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), GXR had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of  $US10 637/QALY and $US853/responder, compared with ATX (incremental costs: $US74;  incremental effectiveness: 0.007 QALYs and 86 responders per 1000 patients treated).  Results of all univariate sensitivity analyses showed that the model results were  robust to changes in model inputs. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first  application of the novel comparative efficacy method of MAIC to a CEA model. The  MAIC results indicate that GXR (0.075-0.12 mg/kg/day) was more effective than ATX  (1.2 mg/kg/day) in the trial population. The CEA results indicate that GXR is cost  effective compared with ATX for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents.",NA,"Erder, M Haim Xie, Jipan Signorovitch, James E Chen, Kristina S Hodgkins, Paul Lu, Mei Wu, Eric Q Sikirica, Vanja",Erder MH Xie J Signorovitch JE Chen KS Hodgkins P Lu M Wu EQ Sikirica V,NA,"Shire Development LLC, Wayne, PA 19087, USA.",eng,NA,"Clinical Trial Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,New Zealand,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Applied health economics and health policy,101150314,IM,NA,NA,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,2012/11/02 06:00,2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez] 2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed] 2013/06/05 06:00 [medline],1 [pii] 10.1007/BF03261873 [doi],ppublish,Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2012 Nov 1;10(6):381-95. doi: 10.1007/BF03261873.,10,6,381-95,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2013 Jun;11(3):305.

Very little information is available on comparative discontinuation  rates of the biologics. OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment discontinuations for 9  biologic DMARDs in adults with RA. METHODS: We searched electronic databases through  May 2012 to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with RA that  compared biologic DMARDs with placebo or another biologic DMARD. The primary outcome  was treatment discontinuation during the blinded phase of the trials, measured as  overall withdrawals, withdrawals resulting from lack of efficacy, and withdrawals  resulting from adverse events. Random-effects meta-analysis estimated the effect  size for individual agents, and adjusted indirect comparisons were made between  biologics using mixed treatment comparisons (MTC) meta-analysis. RESULTS: Forty-four  trials were included in the analysis. In comparison with placebo, biologics were  less likely to be withdrawn because of lack of efficacy (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.17 to  0.27) and more likely to be withdrawn because of an adverse event (OR 1.41, 95% CI  1.16 to 1.70). Based on the MTC, certolizumab had the most favorable overall  withdrawal profile, followed by etanercept and rituximab. Certolizumab had lower  relative withdrawal rates resulting from lack of efficacy than adalimumab, anakinra,  and infliximab. Anakinra had higher relative withdrawal rates resulting from lack of  efficacy than most other biologics. Certolizumab and infliximab had more, while  etanercept had fewer, withdrawals because of adverse events than most other drugs.  CONCLUSIONS: Based on MTC using data from RCTs, differences in discontinuation rates  were observed, generally favoring certolizumab, etanercept, and rituximab over other  biologic DMARDs.

To achieve this goal, generic artemether/lumefantrine  20/120 mg tablets that have been prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO)  were selected as model products for study. METHODS: Data from three bioequivalence  studies conducted independently that compared three generics with the same reference  product were used to indirectly determine the relative bioavailability between the  generics themselves. RESULTS: The different methods of indirect comparison examined  in this study provide consistent results. Methods based on the assumption of a large  sample size give slightly narrower 90 % confidence intervals. Therefore, the use of  methods based on the t test is recommended. Given the precision of the area under  the time-concentration curve (AUC) data, it is possible to conclude that the extent  of exposure of artemether and lumefantrine is bioequivalent between the different  generics studied. However, given the precision of the drug peak concentration  (C(max)) data, it is not possible to demonstrate equivalence within the conventional  acceptance range for all comparisons; it is possible to conclude bioequivalence  within the widened acceptance range 75-133 %. CONCLUSIONS: From a clinical  viewpoint, not only are these prequalified generics bioequivalent and  interchangeable with the reference product (Coartem, Novartis), but also the  existing indirect evidence makes it possible to conclude that these WHO prequalified  products are bioequivalent between themselves with respect to the AUC. The lack of  the necessary precision to demonstrate bioequivalence between generics with respect  to the C(max) within the conventional acceptance range does not preclude considering  them as interchangeable, if necessary, since C(max) is considered to be of less  clinical relevance for the relevant therapy.",NA,"Gwaza, Luther Gordon, John Welink, Jan Potthast, Henrike Hansson, Henrik Stahl, Matthias García-Arieta, Alfredo",Gwaza L Gordon J Welink J Potthast H Hansson H Stahl M García-Arieta A,NA,"Evaluation and Registration Unit, Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe, Harare,  Zimbabwe.",eng,NA,Comparative Study Journal Article Randomized Controlled Trial,20120921,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,IM,NA,NA,2012/09/27 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,2012/05/27 00:00 [received] 2012/08/29 00:00 [accepted] 2012/09/27 06:00 [entrez] 2012/09/27 06:00 [pubmed] 2013/05/01 06:00 [medline],10.1007/s00228-012-1396-1 [doi],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2012 Dec;68(12):1611-8. doi: 10.1007/s00228-012-1396-1.

However, these analyses may be  biased by cross-trial differences in patient populations, sensitivity to modeling  assumptions, and differences in the definitions of outcome measures. The objective  of this study was to demonstrate how incorporating individual patient data (IPD)  from trials of one treatment into indirect comparisons can address several  limitations that arise in analyses based only on aggregate data. METHODS:  Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) use IPD from trials of one treatment  to match baseline summary statistics reported from trials of another treatment.  After matching, by using an approach similar to propensity score weighting,  treatment outcomes are compared across balanced trial populations. This method is  illustrated by reviewing published MAICs in different therapeutic areas. A novel  analysis in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder further demonstrates the  applicability of the method. The strengths and limitations of MAICs are discussed in  comparison to those of indirect comparisons that use only published aggregate data.  RESULTS: Example applications were selected to illustrate how indirect comparisons  based only on aggregate data can be limited by cross-trial differences in patient  populations, differences in the definitions of outcome measures, and sensitivity to  modeling assumptions. The use of IPD and MAIC is shown to address these limitations  in the selected examples by reducing or removing the observed cross-trial  differences. An important assumption of MAIC, as in any comparison of nonrandomized  treatment groups, is that there are no unobserved cross-trial differences that could  confound the comparison of outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect treatment comparisons can  be limited by cross-trial differences. By combining IPD with published aggregate  data, MAIC can reduce observed cross-trial differences and provide decision makers  with timely comparative evidence.",Copyright © 2012 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  (ISPOR).

Aggregate data (AD) and IPD can be combined using conventional pairwise  meta-analysis when IPD cannot be obtained for all relevant studies. We extend the  methodology to combine IPD and AD in a mixed treatment comparison (MTC)  meta-analysis. METHODS: The proposed random-effects MTC models combine IPD and AD  for a dichotomous outcome. We study the benefits of acquiring IPD for a subset of  trials when assessing the underlying consistency assumption by including  treatment-by-covariate interactions in the model. We describe three different model  specifications that make increasingly stronger assumptions regarding the  interactions. We illustrate the methodology through application to real data sets to  compare drugs for treating malaria by using the outcome unadjusted treatment success  at day 28. We compare results from AD alone, IPD alone and all data. RESULTS: When  IPD contributed (i.e. either using IPD alone or combining IPD and AD), the chains  converged, and we identified statistically significant regression coefficients for  the interactions. Using IPD alone, we were able to compare only three of the six  treatments of interest. When models were fitted to AD, the treatment effects and  regression coefficients for the interactions were far more imprecise, and the chains  did not converge. CONCLUSIONS: The models combining IPD and AD encapsulated all  available evidence. When exploring interactions, it can be beneficial to obtain IPD  for a subset of trials and to combine IPD with additional AD.","Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Donegan, Sarah Williamson, Paula D'Alessandro, Umberto Garner, Paul Smith, Catrin Tudur",Donegan S Williamson P D'Alessandro U Garner P Smith CT,NA,"Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of  Liverpool, Shelley's Cottage, Brownlow Street, Liverpool, L69 3GS, UK.  sarah.donegan@liverpool.ac.uk",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20120917,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,NA,NA,2012/09/19 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,2012/09/19 06:00,2011/10/25 00:00 [received] 2012/08/01 00:00 [accepted] 2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez] 2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed] 2013/08/21 06:00 [medline],10.1002/sim.5584 [doi],ppublish,Stat Med. 2013 Mar 15;32(6):914-30. doi: 10.1002/sim.5584.

This simulation study  comprehensively investigated statistical properties and performances of commonly  used ITC and MTC methods, including simple ITC (the Bucher method), frequentist and  Bayesian MTC methods. METHODS: A simple network of three sets of two-arm trials with  a closed loop was simulated. Different simulation scenarios were based on different  number of trials, assumed treatment effects, extent of heterogeneity, bias and  inconsistency. The performance of the ITC and MTC methods was measured by the type I  error, statistical power, observed bias and mean squared error (MSE). RESULTS: When  there are no biases in primary studies, all ITC and MTC methods investigated are on  average unbiased. Depending on the extent and direction of biases in different sets  of studies, ITC and MTC methods may be more or less biased than direct treatment  comparisons (DTC). Of the methods investigated, the simple ITC method has the  largest mean squared error (MSE). The DTC is superior to the ITC in terms of  statistical power and MSE. Under the simulated circumstances in which there are no  systematic biases and inconsistencies, the performances of MTC methods are generally  better than the performance of the corresponding DTC methods. For inconsistency  detection in network meta-analysis, the methods evaluated are on average unbiased.  The statistical power of commonly used methods for detecting inconsistency is very  low. CONCLUSIONS: The available methods for indirect and mixed treatment comparisons  have different advantages and limitations, depending on whether data analysed  satisfies underlying assumptions.

BACKGROUND: The performance of zotarolimus-eluting stents versus other LES, and the  possible improvements of R-ZES versus E-ZES still remain to be defined. METHODS: We  undertook a meta-analysis of trials in which patients were randomly assigned to  percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with R-ZES versus LES, or with E-ZES  versus LES, as well as an indirect comparison of R-ZES versus E-ZES, with LES as  common comparator. The primary efficacy endpoint was ischaemia-driven target vessel  revascularisation (ID-TVR); the primary safety endpoints were myocardial infarction  (MI), cardiac death and cumulative definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST). RESULTS:  Overall, 13'709 patients were assigned to PCI with R-ZES versus LES (n=7185) or with  E-ZES versus LES (n=6524). The risk of ID-TVR (OR (95% CI)=1.06 (0.90 to 1.25),  p=0.47), MI (1.00 (0.81 to 1.25), p=0.97), cardiac death (0.99 (0.69 to 1.42),  p=0.96) and ST (1.18 (0.68 to 2.03), p=0.56) did not differ between R-ZES and LES.  Patients receiving E-ZES were more likely to undergo ID-TVR as compared with those  receiving LES (1.95 (1.40 to 2.73), p<0.0001). The risk of MI (0.91 (0.54 to 1.54),  p=0.73), cardiac death (1.02 (0.54 to 1.91), p=0.96) and ST (1.10 (0.50 to 2.44),  p=0.81) was similar between E-ZES and LES. At indirect comparison, PCI with R-ZES  versus E-ZES reduced the risk of ID-TVR (0.54 (0.37 to 0.78), p=0.001), without  increasing MI (1.09 (0.62 to 1.93), p=0.74), cardiac death (0.97 (0.46 to 2.00),  p=0.93) and ST (1.07 (0.40 to 2.80), p=0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The antirestenotic  efficacy of Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents is superior to Endeavor  zotarolimus-eluting stents and similar to other limus-eluting stents. Endeavor  zotarolimus-eluting stents increase the risk of reinterventions as compared with  other limus-eluting stents.

This paper reviews the published  evidence regarding the cost effectiveness of second-generation antiepileptic drugs  (AEDs). METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed, using the databases  Academic Search Complete, Econlit, EMBASE and MEDLINE. Health economic evaluations  of newer (second-generation) AEDs, published as full-length journal articles, were  searched for. We focused on evaluations of newer AEDs as treatment for partial-onset  seizures. 470 studies were initially identified and 19 were finally included.  Information regarding (i) AEDs studied, (ii) cost effectiveness, and (iii) a variety  of health economic modelling specifics was extracted from each study. Then, the  included studies were summarized and a quality assessment was performed, according  to the British Medical Journal's guidelines for economic studies. RESULTS: The  results were as follows: (i) the cost per additional QALY for newer AEDs used as  adjunctive treatment, compared with standard therapy, ranged between $US19 139  (levetiracetam) and $US57 210 (pregabalin) [year 2010 values]; no cost-effectiveness  evidence was identified for felbamate, eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine or tiagabine;  and (ii) all studies met at least 60% of the British Medical Journal's guidelines  criteria, and seven studies were found to satisfy more than 80% of the criteria.  Guidelines criteria not met involve inadequate reporting of input data and modelling  details, including validation and availability of models used for cost-effectiveness  calculations. CONCLUSIONS: Although failure to meet good practice guidelines  influences the reliability of the presented evidence adversely, a sufficient number  of the included studies were found to comply enough with the guidelines in order for  the qualitative content of the cost-effectiveness results - that some of the newer  AEDs are cost effective - to be reliable. In fact, this conclusion is likely to be  relatively robust, since the effect of improved seizure control on labour market  performance was not included in the base-case results in any of the included studies  and improved seizure control need only to have a moderate effect on sickness  absenteeism in order for the corresponding treatment to be cost effective even when  willingness to pay for an additional QALY is low. However, the cost effectiveness of  newer AEDs has only been studied for a small number of settings, and hence future  studies incorporating additional settings are needed.",NA,"Bolin, Kristian Forsgren, Lars",Bolin K Forsgren L,NA,"Department of Economics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

Direct comparative studies between agents are unavailable. Our objective was to  conduct an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis between new oral agents in  atrial fibrillation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central  through February 2012 for randomized, controlled trials in patients with atrial  fibrillation evaluating apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban versus warfarin. For  dabigatran, only data from the Food and Drug Administration-approved dose were  included. Outcomes included the composite of stroke or systemic embolism, any  stroke, and major bleeding among, others. Outcomes were initially pooled using  standard random-effects methods, producing risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals.  Adjusted indirect comparisons using these pooled estimates were then performed. A  total of 44 733 patients from 4 studies were analyzed. Most analyses yielded no  differences between agents. Dabigatran lowered risk of composite outcome (risk  ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-1.00), ischemic stroke (0.67; 0.48-0.93),  and hemorrhagic stroke (0.45; 0.45-0.99) versus rivaroxaban. No differences in all  strokes or mortality were seen. Apixaban lowered the risk of major bleeding (0.74;  0.60-0.91) and gastrointestinal bleeding (0.58; 0.41-0.82) versus dabigatran and  major bleeding versus rivaroxaban (0.68; 0.55-0.83), but increased systemic emboli  versus rivaroxaban (3.86; 1.17-12.75). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in  efficacy and safety parameters may exist between oral anticoagulant agents in  patients with atrial fibrillation. Apixaban lowers the risk of major and  gastrointestinal bleeding versus dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

Comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness.,NA,"Canadian patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in whom anticoagulation is  appropriate have two new choices for anticoagulation for prevention of stroke and  systemic embolism--dabigatran etexilate (dabigatran) and rivaroxaban. Based on the  RE-LY and ROCKET AF trial results, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of  dabigatran (twice daily dosing of 150 mg or 110 mg based on patient age) versus  rivaroxaban from a Canadian payer perspective. A formal indirect treatment  comparison (ITC) of dabigatran versus rivaroxaban was performed, using dabigatran  clinical event rates from RE-LY for the safety-on-treatment population, adjusted to  the ROCKET AF population. A previously described Markov model was modified to  simulate anticoagulation treatment using ITC results as inputs. Model outputs  included total costs, event rates, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The ITC  found when compared to rivaroxaban, dabigatran had a lower risk of intracranial  haemorrhage (ICH) (relative risk [RR] = 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 -  0.67) and stroke (RR = 0.62; 95%CI 0.45-0.87). Over a lifetime horizon, the model  found dabigatran-treated patients experienced fewer ICHs (0.33 dabigatran vs. 0.71  rivaroxaban) and ischaemic strokes (3.40 vs. 3.96) per 100 patient-years, and  accrued more QALYs (6.17 vs. 6.01). Dabigatran-treated patients had lower acute care  and long-term follow-up costs per patient ($52,314 vs. $53,638) which more than  offset differences in drug costs ($7,299 vs. $6,128). In probabilistic analysis,  dabigatran had high probability of being the most cost-effective therapy at common  thresholds of willingness-to-pay (93% at a $20,000/QALY threshold).

(Afinitor is a registered trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East  Hanover, NJ, USA; Sutent is a registered trademark of Pfizer Inc., New York, NY,  USA.) This analysis examined the projected cost-effectiveness of everolimus vs  sunitinib in this setting from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A semi-Markov model  was developed to simulate a cohort of patients with advanced, progressive pNET and  to estimate the cost per life-year gained (LYG) and per quality-adjusted life-year  (QALY) gained when treating with everolimus vs sunitinib. Efficacy data were based  on a weight-adjusted indirect comparison of the agents using phase 3 trial data.  Model health states included: stable disease with no adverse events, stable disease  with adverse events, disease progression, and death. Therapy costs were based on  wholesale acquisition cost. Other costs such as physician visits, tests,  hospitalizations, and adverse event costs were obtained from literature and/or  primary research. Utility inputs were based on primary research. Sensitivity  analyses were conducted to test the model's robustness. RESULTS: In the base-case  analysis, everolimus was associated with an incremental 0.448 LYG (0.304 QALYs) at  an incremental cost of $12,673, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio  (ICER) of $28,281/LYG ($41,702/QALY gained). The ICER fell within the cost per QALY  range for many widely used oncology drugs. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that,  overall, there is a trend that everolimus is cost-effective compared to sunitinib in  this setting. LIMITATIONS: Results of the indirect analysis were not statistically  significant (p > 0.05). Assumptions that treatment patterns are the same across  therapies may not represent real-world practice.

If it is planned to view treatment  comparisons in both a predefined subgroup and the full population as co-primary  analyses, it is important that the statistical analysis controls the familywise type  I error rate. Spiessens and Debois (Cont. Clin. Trials, 2010, 31, 647-656) recently  proposed an approach specific for this setting, which incorporates an assumption  about the correlation based on the known sizes of the different groups, and showed  that this is more powerful than generic multiple comparisons procedures such as the  Bonferroni correction. If recruitment is slow relative to the length of time taken  to observe the outcome, it may be efficient to conduct an interim analysis. In this  paper, we propose a new method for an adaptive clinical trial with co-primary  analyses in a predefined subgroup and the full population based on the conditional  error function principle. The methodology is generic in that we assume test  statistics can be taken to be normally distributed rather than making any specific  distributional assumptions about individual patient data. In a simulation study, we  demonstrate that the new method is more powerful than previously suggested analysis  strategies. Furthermore, we show how the method can be extended to situations when  the selection is not based on the final but on an early outcome. We use a case study  in a targeted therapy in oncology to illustrate the use of the proposed methodology  with non-normal outcomes.","Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Friede, T Parsons, N Stallard, N",Friede T Parsons N Stallard N,NA,"Department of Medical Statistics, University Medical Center Göttingen, Göttingen,  Germany. tim.friede@med.uni-goettingen.de",eng,G1001344/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom,Journal Article,20120803,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,NA,NA,2012/08/07 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,2011/10/31 00:00 [received] 2012/05/14 00:00 [revised] 2012/07/03 00:00 [accepted] 2012/08/07 06:00 [entrez] 2012/08/07 06:00 [pubmed] 2013/05/29 06:00 [medline],10.1002/sim.5541 [doi],ppublish,Stat Med. 2012 Dec 30;31(30):4309-20. doi: 10.1002/sim.5541.

In this study, conditional estimates of relative treatment  efficacy derived through these techniques show important differences in the fracture  risk reduction profiles of marketed pharmacologic therapies for postmenopausal  osteoporosis. INTRODUCTION: This study illustrates how network meta-analysis  techniques (meta-analysis, adjusted indirect comparison, and MTC) can provide  comparisons of the relative efficacy of postmenopausal osteoporosis therapies in the  absence of comprehensive head-to-head trials. METHODS: Source articles were  identified in MEDLINE; EMBASE; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  (CENTRAL) via Wiley Interscience; and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health  Literature (CINAHL) between April 28, 2009 and November 4, 2009. Two reviewers  identified English-language articles reporting randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  with on-label dosing of marketed osteoporosis agents and fracture endpoints. Trial  design, population characteristics, intervention and comparator, fracture outcomes,  and adverse events were abstracted for analysis. Primary analyses included data from  RCTs with fracture endpoints. Sensitivity analyses also included studies with  fractures reported through adverse event reports. Meta-analysis compared fracture  outcomes for pharmacological therapies vs. placebo (fixed and random effects  models); adjusted indirect comparisons and MTC assessed fracture risk in  postmenopausal women treated with denosumab vs. other agents. RESULTS: Using data  from 34 studies, random effects meta-analysis showed that all agents except  etidronate significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared with  placebo; denosumab, risedronate, and zoledronic acid significantly reduced the risk  for nonvertebral and hip fracture, while alendronate, strontium ranelate, and  teriparatide significantly reduced the risk for nonvertebral fractures. MTC showed  denosumab to be more effective than strontium ranelate, raloxifene, alendronate, and  risedronate in preventing new vertebral fractures.

Each aspect of comparative effectiveness, such as conducting new studies,  synthesizing existing evidence, emphasizing real-world settings, considering  multiple decision makers, and measuring patient-relevant outcomes, will require  expanded definitions when considered in the context of child health. This paper  discusses how comparative effectiveness methods and concepts will differ when  applied to child health and suggests a potential role for decision analysis as a  method to synthesize data and project long-term outcomes.

We sought to compare the efficacy  and safety of the 3 new agents based on data from their published  warfarin-controlled randomized trials, using the method of adjusted indirect  comparisons. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included findings from 44 535 patients enrolled  in 3 trials of the efficacy of dabigatran (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term  Anticoagulation Therapy [RELY]), apixaban (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and  Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE]), and rivaroxaban  (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K  Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation  [ROCKET-AF]), each compared with warfarin. The primary efficacy end point was stroke  or systemic embolism; the safety end point we studied was major hemorrhage. To  address a lack of comparability between trial populations caused by the restriction  of ROCKET-AF to high-risk patients, we conducted a subgroup analysis in patients  with a CHADS(2) score ≥3. We found no statistically significant efficacy differences  among the 3 drugs, although apixaban and dabigatran were numerically superior to  rivaroxaban. Apixaban produced significantly fewer major hemorrhages than dabigatran  and rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS: An indirect comparison of new anticoagulants based on  existing trial data indicates that in patients with a CHADS(2) score ≥3 dabigatran  150 mg, apixaban 5 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 mg resulted in statistically similar rates  of stroke and systemic embolism, but apixaban had a lower risk of major hemorrhage  compared with dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

Treatment by covariate interactions can be included in MTC models to explore how the  covariate modifies the treatment effects. If interactions exist, the assumptions  underlying MTCs may be invalidated. For conventional pair-wise meta-analysis,  important benefits regarding the investigation of such interactions, gained from  using individual patient data (IPD) rather than aggregate data (AD), have been  described. We aim to compare IPD MTC models including patient-level covariates with  AD MTC models including study-level covariates. IPD and AD random-effects MTC models  for dichotomous outcomes are specified. Three assumptions are made regarding the  interactions (i.e. independent, exchangeable and common interactions). The models  are applied to a dataset to compare four drugs for treating malaria (i.e.  amodiaquine-artesunate, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ),  artemether-lumefantrine and chlorproguanil-dapsone plus artesunate) using the  outcome unadjusted treatment success at day 28. The treatment effects and regression  coefficients for interactions from the IPD models were more precise than those from  AD models. Using IPD, assuming independent or exchangeable interactions, the  regression coefficient for chlorproguanil-dapsone plus artesunate versus DHAPQ was  statistically significant and assuming common interactions, the common coefficient  was significant; whereas using AD, no coefficients were significant. Using IPD,  DHAPQ was the best drug; whereas using AD, the best drug varied. Using AD models,  there was no evidence that the consistency assumption was invalid; whereas, the  assumption was questionable based on the IPD models. The AD analyses were  misleading.","Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Donegan, Sarah Williamson, Paula D'Alessandro, Umberto Tudur Smith, Catrin",Donegan S Williamson P D'Alessandro U Tudur Smith C,NA,"Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of  Liverpool, Shelley's Cottage, Brownlow Street, Liverpool L69 3GS, UK.  sarah.donegan@liverpool.ac.uk",eng,NA,"Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20120711,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,NA,NA,2012/07/13 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,2011/10/11 00:00 [received] 2012/05/11 00:00 [accepted] 2012/07/13 06:00 [entrez] 2012/07/13 06:00 [pubmed] 2013/05/29 06:00 [medline],10.1002/sim.5470 [doi],ppublish,Stat Med. 2012 Dec 20;31(29):3840-57. doi: 10.1002/sim.5470.

New oral anticoagulants (NOA)  showed encouraging results vs. warfarin but there are no data directly comparing  different NOA. We performed an adjusted indirect meta-analysis. METHODS: Randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) were searched. Efficacy end points were the cumulative rate  of thomboembolic stroke (TES) and systemic embolism (SE). Main safety end point was  the rate of hemorrhagic stroke (HS). RESULTS: Three RCTs (50578 patients) were  included. Overall, NOA were comparable to warfarin according to the cumulative risk  of TES and SE, as well as for TES alone. NOA were associated with a reduced rate of  SE [OR 0.64 (0.44, 0.94], P=0.02]. Compared to warfarin, NOA were associated with a  significantly reduced risk of HS [OR 0.43 (0.34, 0.55), P<0.001, NNT to avoid a HS  153] and all cause death [OR 0.90 [0.84, 0.96], P=0.03, NNT to save one fatality  43]. Head to head comparison showed that in terms of cumulative rate of TES/SE, as  well as of TES, none of the NOA was significantly superior to the others (all  Ps>0.05). Rivaroxaban showed superiority in the prevention of SE. Dabigatran 150  mg/twice daily was associated with the largest reduction in the risk of HS vs.  warfarin and vs. other NOA. Overall mortality was quite comparable across NOA.  CONCLUSION: Overall superiority of NOA over warfarin is largely influenced by the  reduction of HS.

This included 20 studies (11 AD and  9 IPD), including 11 500 participants. Incorporating the IPD into the network  allowed the inclusion of information on subject level covariates, which produced  markedly more accurate treatment-covariate interaction estimates than an analysis  solely on the AD from all studies. Including evidence at the IPD level in the MTC is  desirable when exploring participant level covariates; even when IPD is available  only for a fraction of the studies. Such modelling may not only reduce  inconsistencies within networks of trials but also assist the estimation of  intervention subgroup effects to guide more individualised treatment decisions.","Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Saramago, Pedro Sutton, Alex J Cooper, Nicola J Manca, Andrea",Saramago P Sutton AJ Cooper NJ Manca A,NA,"Centre for Health Economics, University of York, York, UK. pedro.saramago@york.ac.uk",eng,CDF-2009-02-21/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom RP-PG-0407-10231/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom,Journal Article,20120705,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,NA,NA,2012/07/06 06:00,2013/05/17 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,2011/09/08 00:00 [received] 2012/04/23 00:00 [accepted] 2012/07/06 06:00 [entrez] 2012/07/06 06:00 [pubmed] 2013/05/17 06:00 [medline],10.1002/sim.5442 [doi],ppublish,Stat Med. 2012 Dec 10;31(28):3516-36. doi: 10.1002/sim.5442.

Competition between males or females for mating opportunities  and/or local resources predicts a female bias in taxa with monogamous mating systems  and a male-biased dispersal in polygynous species. In birds and mammals, the  patterns of dispersal between sexes are well explored, while dispersal patterns in  protandrous hermaphroditic fish species have not been studied. We collected 549  adult individuals of Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) from four locations in the  South China Sea. To assess the difference in patterns of dispersal between sexes, we  genotyped all individuals with 18 microsatellites. Significant genetic  differentiation was detected among and within sampling locations. The parameters of  population structure (F(ST)), relatedness (r) and the mean assignment index (mAIC),  in combination with data on tagging-recapture, supplied strong evidences for  female-biased dispersal in the Asian seabass. This result contradicts our initial  hypothesis of no sex difference in dispersal. We suggest that inbreeding avoidance  of females, female mate choice under the condition of low mate competition among  males, and male resource competition create a female-biased dispersal. The bigger  body size of females may be a cause of the female-biased movement. Studies of  dispersal using data from DNA markers and tagging-recapture in hermaphroditic fish  species could enhance our understanding of patterns of dispersal in fish.",NA,"Yue, Gen Hua Xia, Jun Hong Liu, Feng Lin, Grace",Yue GH Xia JH Liu F Lin G,NA,"Molecular Population Genetics Group, Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, National  University of Singapore, Singapore, Republic of Singapore. genhua@tll.org.sg",eng,NA,"Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20120612,NA,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,NA,NA,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/02/13 00:00 [received] 2012/04/27 00:00 [accepted] 2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez] 2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed] 2012/11/09 06:00 [medline],PONE-D-12-04607 [pii] 10.1371/journal.pone.0037976 [doi],ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(6):e37976. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0037976.

DESIGN:  Systematic review, meta-analysis, and indirect treatment comparisons. DATA SOURCES:  Medline and CENTRAL (up to April 2011), clinical trials registers, conference  proceedings, and websites of regulatory agencies. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised  controlled trials of rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or apixaban compared with enoxaparin  for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement.  Two investigators independently extracted data. Relative risks of symptomatic venous  thromboembolism, clinically relevant bleeding, deaths, and a net clinical endpoint  (composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and death) were  estimated using a random effect meta-analysis. RevMan and ITC software were used for  direct and indirect comparisons, respectively. RESULTS: 16 trials in 38,747 patients  were included. Compared with enoxaparin, the risk of symptomatic venous  thromboembolism was lower with rivaroxaban (relative risk 0.48, 95% confidence  interval 0.31 to 0.75) and similar with dabigatran (0.71, 0.23 to 2.12) and apixaban  (0.82, 0.41 to 1.64). Compared with enoxaparin, the relative risk of clinically  relevant bleeding was higher with rivaroxaban (1.25, 1.05 to 1.49), similar with  dabigatran (1.12, 0.94 to 1.35), and lower with apixaban (0.82, 0.69 to 0.98).

However, a comparison to irinotecan + infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin  (FOLFIRI) is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To explore clinical effectiveness and  cost-effectiveness of adding bevacizumab to a regimen of FOLFIRI for the first-line  treatment of mCRC in the Republic of Korea by conducting an indirect treatment  comparison. METHODS: A health-economic model was developed to investigate the  possible health outcomes (life-years gained [LYG]), direct costs, and incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding bevacizumab to a FOLFIRI regimen. Data on  progression-free and overall survival were derived from randomized clinical trials  and were used in the indirect treatment comparison. The annual discount rate for  costs and outcomes was 5%. A lifetime horizon of 8 years was used. Sensitivity  analyses were carried out on all pivotal model assumptions. RESULTS: Incremental  mean overall survival among patients treated with bevacizumab + FOLFIRI varied  between 8.6 and 15.7 months compared with patients treated with FOLFIRI alone. The  deterministic base-case result was 1.177 LYG. The discounted ICERs ranged from μ31.8  to μ39.5 million/LYG, with the base-case result being μ34.5 million/LYG. Treatment  effect had the most impact on the outcomes in this model. CONCLUSIONS: Although  there is no formal threshold for ICER per LYG in Korea, funding may be considered  for bevacizumab + FOLFIRI, particularly if the severity and end-of-life nature of  mCRC is taken into account.","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

OBJECTIVES: Review the use of generic  preference-based measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) within the  context of spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to  identify SCI-related publications that contained any of the following  preference-based HRQoL instruments: 15D, Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-4D,  AQoL-6D, EQ-5D, EQ-5D-5L, Health Utilities Index (HUI)-2, HUI-3, Quality of  Well-Being Scale Self-Administered (QWB-SA), SF-6D(SF-36) or SF-6D(SF-12). In  addition to providing an overview of how different preference-based measures have  been adopted in SCI research to-date, a focus of evaluation was to collate and  appraise evidence for measurement properties and identify knowledge gaps. RESULTS:  Twenty-two articles were identified. No studies have used preference-based measures  in their conventional form, that is, to calculate quality-adjusted life years using  patient-level data. Eleven papers reported mean utility scores (across six different  instruments). Directly comparable data exists for only one SCI-specific sample,  which showed variation across EQ-5D (0.63), HUI-2 (0.81) and HUI-3 (0.68) index  scores. Indirect comparisons suggested differences between QWB-SA and SF-6D index  scores within tetraplegic and paraplegic patient groups. Only the QWB-SA and SF-6D  have undergone (partial) psychometric evaluation, with the respective authors  concluding that the measures have potential for SCI research. CONCLUSIONS: Despite  'cost-effectiveness' being an increasingly important consideration for decision  makers in all areas of health care, there is a distinct lack of conceptual or  empirical research regarding the appropriateness of alternative preference-based  HRQoL measures for SCI populations. Given the support for economic evaluation within  a cost-utility framework and the paucity of psychometric evidence regarding current  instruments, further research is needed.",NA,"Whitehurst, D G T Noonan, V K Dvorak, M F S Bryan, S",Whitehurst DG Noonan VK Dvorak MF Bryan S,NA,"School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver,  British Columbia, Canada. david.whitehurst@ubc.ca",eng,NA,"Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Systematic Review",20120529,England,Spinal Cord,Spinal cord,9609749,IM,NA,NA,2012/05/30 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez] 2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed] 2013/07/09 06:00 [medline],sc201246 [pii] 10.1038/sc.2012.46 [doi],ppublish,Spinal Cord. 2012 Sep;50(9):646-54. doi: 10.1038/sc.2012.46.

No direct comparisons, however, are available for  indacaterol 150 μg with formoterol or indacaterol 300 μg with salmeterol.  Indacaterol trial evidence was synthesized to provide coherent estimates of  indacaterol 150 μg and indacaterol 300 μg relative to formoterol, salmeterol, and  tiotropium. METHODS: Four randomized controlled trials were combined with Bayesian  mixed treatment comparisons by using individual patient-level data. End points of  interest were trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), St. George's  Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and response (≥ 4 points), and  Transition Dyspnea Index total score and response (≥ 1 point). RESULTS: Indacaterol  150 μg demonstrated a higher FEV(1) than did formoterol at 12 weeks and 6 months  (0.10 L difference; 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.06-0.14), as did indacaterol 300  μg versus salmeterol (0.06 L difference at 12 weeks; CrI = 0.02-0.10; 0.06 L at 6  months; CrI = 0.02-0.11). Regarding SGRQ, indacaterol 150 μg demonstrated a  comparable proportion of responders versus formoterol, as did indacaterol 300 μg  versus salmeterol. In comparison to tiotropium, indacaterol 150 μg demonstrated a  greater proportion of responders (odds ratio = 1.52 at 12 weeks; CrI 1.15-2.00). For  Transition Dyspnea Index, indacaterol 150 μg and formoterol showed a similar  response. Indacaterol 300 μg was more efficacious than salmeterol (odds ratio = 1.65  at 12 weeks; CrI 1.16-2.34). Overall, indacaterol 150 μg showed the greatest  efficacy for SGRQ and indacaterol 300 μg for FEV(1) and Transition Dyspnea Index.  CONCLUSION: Indacaterol is expected to be comparable to formoterol, salmeterol, and  tiotropium, providing higher FEV(1) than formoterol and salmeterol and greater  improvement in the SGRQ total score than tiotropium. Indacaterol 150 μg provided  comparable improvement in dyspnea, while indacaterol 300 μg demonstrated the  greatest response overall.",Copyright © 2012 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research  (ISPOR).

METHODS: Individual patient data were used  from a GXR trial; only published summary data were used from ATX trials. In a  matching-adjusted indirect comparison, individual patients from the GXR trial were  weighted such that their mean baseline characteristics matched those published for  ATX trials. Placebo-arm outcomes were then compared to further assess balance  between the matched populations. Changes in the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised  Short Form Oppositional Subscale from baseline to endpoint among GXR-treated and  ATX-treated patients were then compared. RESULTS: Before matching, the GXR (n = 143)  and ATX (n = 98) trial populations had significant differences in baseline  characteristics and placebo-arm outcomes. After matching, baseline characteristics  were well balanced across trials, and placebo-arm outcomes became nearly identical.  Comparing active treatment arms across the matched populations, GXR was associated  with a significantly greater reduction in mean Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised  Short form oppositional subscale compared with ATX {-5.0 [95% confidence interval  (CI): -6.6 to -3.4] vs. -2.4 [CI: -3.7 to -1.1], p = 0.01, effect size = 0.58}.  CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head randomized trials, matching-adjusted  indirect comparisons can provide timely and reliable comparative evidence for  decision makers and can be applied even when very few trials are available for the  treatments of interest.","Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Signorovitch, James Erder, M Haim Xie, Jipan Sikirica, Vanja Lu, Mei Hodgkins, Paul S Wu, Eric Q",Signorovitch J Erder MH Xie J Sikirica V Lu M Hodgkins PS Wu EQ,NA,"Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, MA, United States. jsignorovitch@analysisgroup.com",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,England,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,9208369,IM,NA,NA,2012/05/11 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez] 2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed] 2012/09/05 06:00 [medline],10.1002/pds.3246 [doi],ppublish,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2012 May;21 Suppl 2:130-7. doi: 10.1002/pds.3246.,21 Suppl 2,NA,130-7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20120904,0 (Delayed-Action Preparations) 0 (Propylamines) 30OMY4G3MK (Guanfacine) 57WVB6I2W0 (Atomoxetine Hydrochloride),"Adolescent Atomoxetine Hydrochloride Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/complications/drug  therapy/epidemiology Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders/complications/*drug  therapy/epidemiology Child *Comparative Effectiveness Research Delayed-Action Preparations Guanfacine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Humans *Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care/statistics & numerical data Pharmacoepidemiology/*methods/statistics & numerical data Propylamines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*standards/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Between 2005 and 2007, five randomized studies  comparing different treatment arms among artesunate-amodiaquine and other ACT were  conducted in Cameroonian children aged two to 60 months who had uncomplicated  Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In these studies, the categorical criterion proposed  by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess the relative effectiveness of  anti-malarial drugs was repeatedly evaluated on Days 14, 21 and 28 after treatment  initiation. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of different  treatments on this repeated ordinal outcome, hence using the fully available  information. METHODS: The quantitative synthesis was based on individual patient  data. Due to the incomplete block design concerning treatment arms between different  trials, a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis approach was adopted. The  repeated ordinal outcome was modelled through a latent variable, as a proportional  odds mixed model with trial, period and treatment arms as covariates. The model was  further complexified to account for the variance heterogeneity, and the individual  log-residual variance was modelled as a linear mixed model, as well. The effects of  individual covariates at inclusion, such as parasitaemia, fever, gender and weight,  were also tested. Model parameters were estimated using a Bayesian approach via the  WinBUGS software. After selecting the best model using Deviance Information  Criterion (DIC), mixed treatment comparisons were based on the estimated treatment  effects. RESULTS: Modeling the residual variance improved the model ability to  adjust the data. The results showed that, compared to artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ),  dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHPP) was significantly more efficacious.  Artesunate-chlorproguanil-dapsone (ASCD) was less efficacious than  artesunate-sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (ASSP), artemether-lumefantrine (AMLM) and  DHPP, the difference with the latter being significant. No difference in efficacy  was found between ASAQ and AMLM. CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons  of a network of connected randomized trials with repeated measurements of the  primary categorical outcome allowed to take into account both the individual- and  between- studies sources of heterogeneity. The results of the present study complete  the previous quantitative review based on a binary outcome at a fixed time point,  suggesting that DHPP represents an alternative for the treatment of uncomplicated P.  falciparum malaria in Cameroonian children.",NA,"Whegang Youdom, Solange Samson, Adeline Basco, Leonardo K Thalabard, Jean-Christophe",Whegang Youdom S Samson A Basco LK Thalabard JC,NA,"Ecole Nationale Supérieure Polytechnique, Université de Yaoundé 1, B.

The US Food and Drug  Administration has approved ADA as a medication for use in rheumatoid arthritis,  psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and  juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This year marks 10 years of clinical experience with  ADA. Long-term extension studies of some of the initial clinical trials, as well as  data from large patient registries, are demonstrating ongoing benefit for  responders. Potential side effects such as increased risk of infection, lymphoma,  congestive heart failure, and demyelination continue to be examined, as the  available data are not unanimous in showing an increase in incidence. In balancing  both the advantages and the disadvantages of using ADA, the drug's overall  effectiveness and its availability for use in patients with hepatic or renal  comorbidities are weighed against the high cost. ADA is expected to have a leading  role in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions for  years to come. Future studies will need to address the optimal sequence of  disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics to use, combinations of  disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, and head-to-head comparisons of  biologics in clinical trials. For those who go into clinical remission on an  anti-tumor necrosis factor medication, unanswered questions remain about identifying  the patients who can maintain the remission off all drugs, or at least off injected  medication.

We  aimed to perform a systematic review of incident and recurrent CDI in PPI users, and  to evaluate the relative impact of concurrent antibiotic use, or switching acid  suppression to histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs). METHODS: We searched  MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to December 2011 for controlled observational  studies that reported on the risk of CDI with and without PPI use. We performed  random effects meta-analysis and assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I(2)  statistic. RESULTS: We included 42 observational studies (30 case-control, 12  cohort) totalling 313,000 participants overall. Pooled analysis of 39 studies showed  a statistically significant association between PPI use and risk of developing CDI,  odds ratio (OR) 1.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-2.85, P<0.001, I(2)=85%)  compared with non-users. A pooled analysis of three studies showed a significant  associated risk of recurrent CDI associated with PPIs, OR 2.51 (95% CI 1.16-5.44,  P=0.005, I(2)=78%). Subgroup analysis failed to fully clarify the source of the  substantial statistical heterogeneity. Adjusted indirect comparison demonstrated  that use of H2RAs as an alternative carried a lower-risk OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.53-0.97)  compared with PPIs. Conversely, concomitant use of PPI and antibiotics conferred a  greater-risk OR 1.96 (95% CI 1.03-3.70) above that of PPIs alone. For PPI and  antibiotics, the Rothman's synergy index was 1.36 and attributable proportion of  risk from interaction 0.19, indicating an increased risk from interaction beyond the  effects of each drug alone. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the substantial statistical and  clinical heterogeneity, our findings indicate a probable association between PPI use  and incident and recurrent CDI. This risk is further increased by concomitant use of  antibiotics and PPI, whereas H2RAs may be less harmful.",NA,"Kwok, Chun Shing Arthur, Aaron Kobina Anibueze, Chukwudubem Ifeanyichukwu Singh, Sonal Cavallazzi, Rodrigo Loke, Yoon Kong",Kwok CS Arthur AK Anibueze CI Singh S Cavallazzi R Loke YK,NA,"Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.",eng,NA,Journal Article Meta-Analysis Systematic Review,20120424,United States,Am J Gastroenterol,The American journal of gastroenterology,0421030,IM,NA,NA,2012/04/25 06:00,2012/10/25 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez] 2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed] 2012/10/25 06:00 [medline],ajg2012108 [pii] 10.1038/ajg.2012.108 [doi],ppublish,Am J Gastroenterol. 2012 Jul;107(7):1011-9. doi: 10.1038/ajg.2012.108.

However, for clinical decisions, we need to know the effectiveness of each  possible treatment in comparison with all relevant alternatives, not with just one.  OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacies and adverse effects of all relevant  antibiotics for UTI treatment simultaneously by performing a network meta-analysis  using direct and indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: Using logistic regression  analysis, we performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) published after 1999 that compared different oral antibiotic or placebo  regimens for UTI treatment in general practice or outpatient settings. We looked at  five binary outcomes: early clinical, early bacteriological, late clinical and late  bacteriological outcomes, as well as adverse effects. Consequently, a ranking of the  antibiotic regimens could be composed. RESULTS: Using a network structure, we could  compare and rank nine treatments from 10 studies. Overall, ciprofloxacin and  gatifloxacin appeared the most effective treatments, and amoxicillin-clavulanate  appeared the least effective treatment. In terms of adverse effects, there were no  significant differences. DISCUSSION: Network meta-analysis shows some clear efficacy  differences between different antibiotic treatments for UTI in women. It provides a  useful tool for clinical decision making in everyday practice.

METHODS: A systematic literature search identified 11 individual studies  investigating the efficacy of abatacept, infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept,  certolizumab pegol, and golimumab in adult patients with RA that did not respond to  MTX. The clinical trials included in this analysis were similar in trial design,  baseline patient characteristics, and background therapy (i.e., MTX). The key  clinical endpoints of interest were the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) change  from baseline (CFB) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses at 6  months (24-28 weeks). Results were analyzed using Bayesian network metaanalysis  methods, and were expressed as differences in HAQ CFB and ACR20/50/70 relative  risks, with 95% credible limits (CrL). RESULTS: Analysis of HAQ CFB at 6 months  showed that abatacept is more efficacious than placebo [mean difference in HAQ CFB:  -0.30 (95% CrL -0.42; -0.16)] and comparable to all other biologic agents, in  patients receiving MTX as background treatment.

The submission  addressed only part of the decision problem and did not provide evidence to compare  trabectedin (Yondelis®, PharmaMar) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride  (PLDH) (Caelyx®, Schering-Plough) with key comparators. The submission's direct  comparison evidence came from one reasonable-quality randomised controlled trial  (RCT) of trabectedin and PLDH versus PLDH alone (ET743-OVA-301). The results of the  RCT were subdivided into the entire platinum-sensitive population (> 6-month relapse  after initial platinum-based chemotherapy) and partially platinum-sensitive (≥ 6- to  12-month relapse) and fully platinum-sensitive (> 12-month relapse) populations. The  outcomes included were overall survival, progression-free survival measured by three  types of assessor, response rates, adverse effects of treatment, health-related  quality of life and cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained. A mixed  treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis comparing trabectedin and PLDH with  single-agent PLDH within the entire platinum-sensitive population, with paclitaxel  or with topotecan also formed part of the submission. The RCT data showed that  trabectedin plus PLDH compared with PLDH monotherapy had a significant effect on  overall survival only within the partially platinum-sensitive subgroup. PFS results  reported by the independent radiologists showed significant effects in favour of the  trabectedin and PLDH arm for the entire and partially platinum-sensitive populations  only. Rates of grade 3 and 4 adverse events were mostly higher in the trabectedin  and PLDH arm than in the PLDH alone arm. There were several issues regarding the  undertaking of the MTC, and thus the data were not considered robust. Furthermore,  the ERG did not believe the MTC to be necessary to answer the decision problem. The  manufacturer submitted a de novo cost-effectiveness model. The main analysis  compared trabectedin in combination with PLDH versus paclitaxel, topotecan and PLDH  (each as monotherapy) in the entire platinum-sensitive population, using results  estimated from the MTC. Additional analyses were presented comparing trabectedin in  combination with PLDH versus PLDH monotherapy using direct evidence from the OVA-301  trial for the fully, partially and entire platinum-sensitive populations. The cost  per QALY gained for trabectedin in combination with PLDH versus PLDH monotherapy was  estimated to be £ 70,076 in the main analysis. In the additional analyses, the cost  per QALY gained for trabectedin in combination with PLDH versus PLDH monotherapy was  £ 94,832, £ 43,996 and £ 31,092 for the entire, partially and fully  platinum-sensitive populations, respectively.

The purpose of this study is to compare annualized relapse rates (ARR) of  fingolimod versus all of the commonly used first-line treatments in RRMS using  evidence from both placebo-controlled and head-to-head studies. In absence of the  head-to-head data between fingolimod and the other treatments, these comparisons  were formed using meta-analysis techniques for indirect treatment comparisons.  METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE,  and the Cochrane Library with no limitations applied on publication language or  dates. Included studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating one or more of  fingolimod, interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, or glatiramer acetate in RRMS  populations. Primary outcome was ARR. Data extraction included author, year,  treatment, dosage, mean age, percentage females, duration of disease, Expanded  Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at baseline, relapses in 2 years prior to  baseline, trial duration, relapse-related outcome, and definition of relapse. The  indirect treatment comparisons were performed using a mixed-treatment comparison  framework. ARR was analyzed as a Poisson outcome. RESULTS: The relative ARRs, for  each treatment versus fingolimod, estimated from our meta-analyses were 1.43  (glatiramer acetate 20 mg), 1.51 (interferon beta-1b 250 mcg), 1.55 (interferon  beta-1a 44 mcg), 1.67 (interferon beta-1a 22 mcg), 1.93 (interferon beta-1a 30 mcg),  and 2.32 (placebo). None of the 95% confidence intervals for these estimates  overlapped unity, implying statistical significance of these findings. LIMITATIONS:  The key limitations of this study are the persisting heterogeneity even after  adjusting for covariates and the variability in outcome definition across the  included trials.

746,27905717,NA,Publisher,NA,NA,2012 Apr,NA,NA,"This Technical Support Document focuses on heterogeneity in relative treatment  effects. Heterogeneity indicates the presence of effect-modifiers. A distinction is  usually made between true variability in treatment effects due to variation between  patient populations or settings, and biases related to the way in which trials were  conducted. Variability in relative treatment effects threatens the external validity  of trial evidence, and limits the ability to generalise from the results,  imperfections in trial conduct represent threats to internal validity. In either  case it is emphasised that, although we continue to focus attention on evidence from  trials, the study of effect-modifying covariates is in every way a form of  observational study, because patients cannot be randomised to covariate values. This  document provides guidance on methods for outlier detection, meta-regression and  bias adjustment, in pair-wise meta-analysis, indirect comparisons and network  meta-analysis, using illustrative examples. Guidance is given on the implications of  heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness analysis. We argue that the predictive  distribution of a treatment effect in a “new” trial may, in many cases, be more  relevant to decision making than the distribution of the mean effect. Investigators  should consider the relative contribution of true variability and random variation  due to biases, when considering their response to heterogeneity. Where subgroup  effects are suspected, it is suggested that a single analysis including an  interaction term is superior to running separate analyses for each subgroup. Three  types of meta-regression models are discussed for use in network meta-analysis where  trial-level effect-modifying covariates are present or suspected: (1) Separate  unrelated interaction terms for each treatment; (2) Exchangeable and related  interaction terms; (3) A single common interaction term. We argue that the single  interaction term is the one most likely to be useful in a decision making context.  Illustrative examples of Bayesian metaregression against a continuous covariate and  meta-regression against “baseline” risk are provided and the results are  interpreted. Annotated WinBUGS code is set out in an Appendix. Meta-regression with  individual patient data is capable of estimating effect modifiers with far greater  precision, because of the much greater spread of covariate values. Methods for  combining IPD in some trials with aggregate data from other trials are explained.  Finally, four methods for bias adjustment are discussed: meta-regression; use of  external priors to adjust for bias associated with markers of lower study quality;  use of network synthesis to estimate and adjust for quality-related bias internally;  and use of expert elicitation of priors for bias.","Copyright © 2012 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, unless  otherwise stated.

DATA SOURCES: English-language articles from 1980 to February 2011 identified  through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and International Pharmaceutical  Abstracts; unpublished literature including dossiers from pharmaceutical companies.  METHODS: Two people independently selected relevant head-to-head trials of any  sample size, prospective cohort studies with at least 100 participants, and relevant  good- or fair-quality meta-analyses that compared benefits or harms of 14 drug  therapies. Retrospective cohort studies were also included for harms. For biologic  DMARDs, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCTs were also included. We required trials  and cohort studies to have a study duration of at least 12 weeks. Literature was  synthesized qualitatively within and between the two main drug classes (oral and  biologic DMARDs). Network meta-analysis also was performed to examine the relative  efficacy of biologic DMARDs and comparing withdrawal rates from placebo controlled  trials. RESULTS: Head-to-head trials showed no clinically important differences in  efficacy among oral DMARD comparisons (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide).  The only head-to-head trial comparing biologic DMARDs (abatacept vs. infliximab)  found no clinically important differences. Combination therapy of biologic DMARDs  plus methotrexate improved clinical response rates and functional capacity more than  monotherapy with methotrexate. Network meta-analyses found higher odds of reaching  ACR 50 response for etanercept compared with most other biologic DMARDs (abatacept,  adalimumab, anakinra, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab) for methotrexate-resistant  patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Similar overall tolerability profiles  were found among oral and biologic DMARDs, but short-term adverse events were more  common with biologic DMARDs. Adjusted indirect comparisons of biologic DMARDs found  that certolizumab had the most favorable overall withdrawal profile, followed by  etanercept and rituximab. Certolizumab had lower relative withdrawal rates due to  lack of efficacy than adalimumab, anakinra, and infliximab. Certolizumab and  infliximab had more, while etanercept had fewer withdrawals due to adverse events  than most other drugs. Evidence was insufficient to assess comparative risk of  serious adverse events among biologic DMARDs. Combinations of biologic DMARDs have  higher rates of serious adverse events than biologic DMARD monotherapy. Limited data  existed for subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Limited head-to-head comparative evidence does  not support one therapy over another for adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

This paper aims to systematically review the evidence from all available clinical  trials of erlotinib and pemetrexed as maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC.  METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed in PUBMED, EMBASE and  Cochrane databases. Abstracts presented at two conferences were also researched. The  effects of erlotinib and pemetrexed on overall survival and progression-free  survival were compared using an indirect treatment comparison method with placebo or  observation as a common comparator. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled studies were  included. Both interventions offered significant advantages for overall survival  (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo or observation. Using  indirect comparison meta-analysis, the relative hazards ratio of pemetrexed compared  with erlotinib for PFS was 0.71 (95% CI 0.60-0.85; p = 0.0001), suggested that  pemetrexed was superior to erlotinib in terms of progression-free survival. Although  relative hazards ratio for OS showed no significant difference between the two  agents (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71-1.08, p = 0.22).

As long as a meta-analysis is not limited by poor quality of included  trials, unexplainable heterogeneity and/or reporting bias of individual trials,  meta-analyses can be instrumental in reliably demonstrating benefit or harm of an  intervention when results of individual randomised controlled trials are conflicting  or inconclusive. Therefore meta-analyses should be conducted as part of a systematic  review, i.e., a systematic approach to answer a focused clinical question. Important  features of a systematic review are a comprehensive, reproducible search for primary  studies, selection of studies using clear and transparent eligibility criteria,  standardised critical appraisal of studies for quality, and investigation of  heterogeneity among included studies. Cumulative meta-analysis may prevent delays in  the introduction of effective treatments and may allow for early detection of  harmful effects of interventions. As opposed to meta-analysis based on aggregate  study data, individual patient data meta-analyses offer the advantage to use  standardised criteria across trials and reliably investigate subgroup effects of  interventions. Network meta-analysis allows the integration of data from direct and  indirect comparisons in order to compare multiple treatments in a comprehensive  analysis and determine the best treatment among several options. We conclude that  meta-analysis has become a popular, versatile, and powerful tool.

METHODS: An economic model was  developed to compare costs and clinical outcomes over a 5-year time horizon. Both  costs and outcomes were discounted at a 5% rate, in accordance with Brazilian  pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Clinical inputs were determined using indirect  treatment comparisons. Costs were derived from public reimbursement databases and  reported in 2010 Brazilian real (R$1 = USD$0.52). Clinical outcomes included  progression-free survival years (PFYs), life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted  life-years (QALYs). The economic outcome was the incremental cost per LY, PFY, or  QALY gained. The impact of variations in individual inputs (eg, drug cost, drug  effectiveness) was examined using one-way sensitivity analyses. Overall model  robustness was tested using probabilistic sensitivity analyses, varying the ranges  of all input parameters within their standard distributions. RESULTS: Expected cost  per patient was R$41,195 for CAP, R$95,256 for LAP/CAP, and R$113,686 for TRAST/CAP.  Respective LYs were 1.406, 1.695, and 1.465; PFYs were 0.473, 0.711, and 0.612; and  QALYS were 0.769, 0.958, and 0.827. LAP/CAP dominated TRAST/CAP for all outcomes.  Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of LAP/CAP over CAP were R$186,563 for LYs,  R$226,403 for PFYs, and R$284,864 for QALYs. Results remained unchanged in one-way  sensitivity analyses. In probabilistic analyses, LAP/CAP was dominant over TRAST/CAP  in 93.5% of simulations. CONCLUSION: LAP/CAP increases survival for women with human  epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive metastatic breast cancer. LAP/CAP is  cost-effective against TRAST/CAP (ie, produces more benefits at a lower cost) and  can be considered cost-effective over CAP at a willingness-to-pay of about R$290,000  (US$151,000) per QALY gained.",NA,"Machado, Marcio Einarson, Thomas R",Machado M Einarson TR,NA,"GlaxoSmithKline Brasil Ltd, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

A limited design of experiment was  conducted to establish a standardized dry coating procedure that limits the extent  of powder attrition, while providing the most consistent improvement in angle of  repose (AOR). The magnetically assisted impaction coating (MAIC) was considered as a  model dry-coater for pharmaceutical powders; ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and ascorbic  acid. Dry coated drug powders were characterized by AOR, particle size as a function  of dispersion pressure, particle size distribution, conditioned bulk density (CBD),  Carr index (CI), flow function coefficient (FFC), cohesion coefficient using  different instruments, including a shear cell in the Freeman FT4 powder rheometer,  and Hansen flowability index. Substantial improvement was observed in all the  measured properties after dry coating relative to the uncoated powders, such that  each powder moved from a poorer to a better flow classification and showed improved  dispersion. The material intrinsic property such as cohesion, plotted as a function  of particle size, gave a trend similar to those of bulk flow properties, AOR and CI.  Property improvement is also illustrated in a phase map of inverse cohesion (or FFC)  as a function of bulk density, which also indicated a significant positive shift due  to dry coating. It is hoped that such phase maps are useful in manufacturing  decisions regarding the need for dry coating, which will allow moving from wet  granulation to roller compaction or to direct compression based formulations.",Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although CER evidence regarding  medications is particularly needed shortly after market approval, key methodological  challenges include (i) potential bias due to channeling of patients to the newly  marketed medication because of various patient-, physician-, and system-related  factors; (ii) rapid changes in the characteristics of the user population during the  early phase of marketing; and (iii) lack of timely data and the often small number  of users in the first few months of marketing. We propose a mix of approaches to  generate comparative-effectiveness data in the early marketing period, including  sequential cohort monitoring with secondary health-care data and propensity score  (PS) balancing, as well as extended follow-up of phase III and phase IV trials,  indirect comparisons of placebo-controlled trials, and modeling and simulation of  virtual trials.",NA,"Schneeweiss, S Gagne, J J Glynn, R J Ruhl, M Rassen, J A",Schneeweiss S Gagne JJ Glynn RJ Ruhl M Rassen JA,NA,"Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.  schneeweiss@post.harvard.edu",eng,K01-HS018088/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States R01-LM010213/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States RC1-LM010351/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States RC1-RR028231/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States RC4-HL102023/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,"Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",20111102,United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,IM,NA,NA,2011/11/04 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00 [entrez] 2011/11/04 06:00 [pubmed] 2011/12/30 06:00 [medline],clpt2011235 [pii] 10.1038/clpt.2011.235 [doi],ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2011 Dec;90(6):777-90. doi: 10.1038/clpt.2011.235.

METHODS: We carried out  a meta-analysis. We searched in the Embase, Medline, Cinahl, Dare, Coch, Central,  and CNKI databases and congress abstracts for trials comparing continuous positive  airway pressure (CPAP) or NIPPV with standard therapy (ST). To assess treatment  effects, we carried out direct comparison using a random effects model and adjusted  indirect comparison. RESULTS: At total of 34 studies (3,041 patients) were included.  In direct comparisons, both CPAP and NIPPV reduced the risk of death (relative risk  [RR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.93; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.58-1.10; respectively) compared with  ST, although only CPAP had a significant effect. There were no significant  differences between NIPPV and CPAP. Pooled results of direct and adjusted indirect  comparisons showed that compared with ST, both CPAP and NIPPV significantly reduced  mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.89; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.97; respectively).

Subsequent to this appraisal, randomised controlled trial (RCT) data for raltitrexed  plus cisplatin and comparing chemotherapy to active symptom control (ASC) has become  available, allowing a more complete analysis of the comparative efficacy and  cost-effectiveness of first-line chemotherapy in MPM. METHODS: An adjusted indirect  comparison is used to estimate the relative efficacy of raltitrexed plus cisplatin  and pemetrexed plus cisplatin. A cost-effectiveness model is used to assess the  lifetime costs and health outcomes associated with these comparators and ASC.  Patient level data from the EORTC 08983 trial are used to estimate baseline  progression and survival rates. Relative treatment effects are taken from RCTs; cost  and utility data from the literature. RESULTS: Raltitrexed plus cisplatin and  pemetrexed plus cisplatin were not found to be statistically significantly different  with respect to overall response, progression free survival or overall survival. The  cost-effectiveness analysis found raltitrexed plus cisplatin to be cost-effective at  a cost per quality adjusted life year of £13,454 compared to cisplatin and £27,360  compared to ASC. Pemetrexed plus cisplatin is dominated by raltitrexed plus  cisplatin as the raltitrexed combination offers marginally higher quality adjusted  life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs) at a substantially lower total cost.  CONCLUSION: Raltitrexed plus cisplatin is a cost-effective first-line treatment for  MPM.

These targeted therapies are currently competing to be primary choice;  hence, in the absence of direct head-to-head comparison, there is a need for valid  indirect comparison assessment. METHODS: Standard indirect comparison methods were  applied to independent review PFS data of the pivotal Phase III trials, to determine  indirect treatment comparison hazard-ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%  CI). As BEV+IFN and SUN have been compared to IFN, indirect comparison was enabled  by the common IFN comparator arms. As PAZ was compared to placebo (PLA), a connector  trial (IFN vs PLA) was required for the indirect comparison to BEV+IFN. Sensitivity  analyses taking into account real-life influence of patient compliance on clinical  outcomes were performed. RESULTS: The indirect efficacy comparison resulted in a  statistically nonsignificant PFS difference of BEV+IFN vs SUN (HR: 1.06; 95% CI:  0.78-1.45; P = 0.73) and of BEV+IFN vs PAZ (range based on different connector  trials; HR: 0.74-1.03; P = 0.34-0.92). Simulating real-life patient compliance and  its effectiveness impact showed an increased tendency towards BEV+IFN without  reaching statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There is no statistically  significant PFS difference between BEV+IFN and TKIs in first-line mRCC.

Due to this  reason, it is important to understand the risks involved with the drug class and  individual statins. AIM: We conducted a meta-analysis and employed indirect  comparisons to identify differing risk effects across statins. DESIGN: We included  any randomized clinical trial (RCT) of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin,  pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin used for cardiovascular  disease event prevention. The main outcome was adverse events [all-cause mortality,  cancers, rhabdomylosis, diabetes, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT),  and creatinine kinase (CK) increases beyond the upper limit of normal]. In order to  evaluate the relative effects of each drug on adverse events, we calculated adjusted  indirect comparisons of the adverse-event outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-two trials  involving 159,458 patients met our inclusion criteria. Overall, statin treatments  significantly increased the rate of diabetes when compared to controls (OR: 1.09;  95% CI: 1.02-1.16) and elevated AST (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.04-1.66) and ALT (OR: 1.28;  95% CI: 1.11-1.48) levels when compared to controls. Using indirect comparisons, we  also found that atorvastatin significantly elevated AST levels compared to  pravastatin (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.13-4.29) and simvastatin significantly increased CK  levels when compared to rosuvastatin (OR: 4.39; 95% CI: 1.01-19.07). Higher dose  studies had increased risk of AST elevations. DISCUSSION: Although statins are  generally well tolerated, there are risks associated with almost all drugs.

Previously, we clarified  the structures of serotype 7 GPL and two methyltransferase genes (orfA and orfB) in  serotype 12 GPL. This study elucidated the chemical structure, biosynthesis gene,  and host innate immune response of serotype 13 GPL. The oligosaccharide (OSE)  structure of serotype 13 GPL was determined to be  4-2'-hydroxypropanoyl-amido-4,6-dideoxy-β-hexose-(1 → 3)-4-O-methyl-α-L-rhamnose-(1  → 3)-α-L-rhamnose-(1 → 3)-α-L-rhamnose-(1 → 2)-α-L-6-deoxy-talose by using  chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses.  The structure of the serotype 13 GPL was different from those of serotype 7 and 12  GPLs only in O-methylations. We found a relationship between the structure and  biosynthesis gene cluster. M. intracellulare serotypes 12 and 13 have a 1.95-kb  orfA-orfB gene responsible for 3-O-methylation at the terminal hexose, orfB, and  4-O-methylation at the rhamnose next to the terminal hexose, orfA. The serotype 13  orfB had a nonfunctional one-base missense mutation that modifies serotype 12 GPL to  serotype 13 GPL. Moreover, the native serotype 13 GPL was multiacetylated and  recognized via Toll-like receptor 2. The findings presented here imply that  serotypes 7, 12, and 13 are phylogenetically related and confirm that acetylation of  the GPL is necessary for host recognition.

The University of Aberdeen Health Technology Assessment Group were  commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG); the role of the ERG being to  appraise the manufacturer's submission and to produce an independent report. This  article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's  subsequent decisions. The manufacturer considered that denosumab would be  appropriate for patients unable to take, comply with or tolerate oral  bisphosphonates. Comparator treatments selected for the submission were, therefore,  'no treatment', raloxifene, strontium ranelate, intravenous zoledronic acid,  intravenous ibandronate and teriparatide. The main effectiveness evidence for  denosumab was derived from a large randomized controlled trial comparing denosumab  with placebo. Given by subcutaneous injection at 6-monthly intervals for 3 years,  denosumab reduced the incidence of hip fracture by 40%, and reduced the incidence of  clinical vertebral fracture by 69%. An indirect treatment comparison was used to  derive adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for different types of fracture for  each comparator versus placebo. The RRs (95% CI) applied for denosumab were 0.316  (0.208, 0.478) for clinical vertebral fracture, 0.605 (0.373, 0.983) for hip  fracture and 0.842 (0.638, 1.110) for wrist fracture. Despite a number of concerns  surrounding the methodology of the indirect comparison, the ERG was satisfied with  the robustness of the effect estimates. The RR estimates were applied in a  good-quality Markov model that took account of drug costs, administration and  monitoring costs, costs associated with fractures, and long-term nursing home costs.  Utility weights were used to adjust time spent in fracture states, allowing QALYs to  be estimated. The base-case analysis was conducted for women aged 70 years with a  T-score of -2.5 or less and no prior fracture, and women aged 70 years with a  T-score of -2.5 or less with a prior fragility fracture. Subgroup analyses based on  T-score and independent clinical risk factors were also undertaken. Applying a  willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £30 000 per QALY, the manufacturer's results  suggested that denosumab would offer a cost-effective alternative to all treatment  comparators for the primary and secondary prevention of fractures. The ERG was  concerned about an assumption that denosumab would be administered in general  practice at the average cost of two standard GP visits a year. As a result, the ERG  requested some further sensitivity analysis and undertook some further modelling,  applying an assumption that denosumab would be provided primarily in secondary care.  This modification altered the cost effectiveness of denosumab versus 'no treatment'  (in women with no prior fragility fracture) and zoledronic acid.

The aim of this study was to compare 12-week glycaemic control with vildagliptin  50 mg twice daily versus sitagliptin 50 or 100 mg once daily in Japanese patients  with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Randomized trials of vildagliptin or sitagliptin in  Japanese patients were identified from the literature. Individual patient data were  obtained for vildagliptin trials. In the absence of a head-to-head randomized trial,  a matching-adjusted indirect comparison was conducted by weighting individual  patients from vildagliptin trials to match average baseline characteristics  published for sitagliptin trials, including age, sex, body mass index, glycosylated  haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and diabetes duration. After  matching, HbA(1c) change from baseline to week 12, the primary endpoint in each  trial, was compared between balanced populations treated with vildagliptin and  sitagliptin. Separate comparisons were conducted for vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily  versus sitagliptin 50 mg and 100 mg once daily. RESULTS: Two trials of vildagliptin  and three trials of sitagliptin were identified for Japanese patients. Across all  included trials, a total of 264 patients were treated with vildagliptin 50 mg twice  daily, 235 were treated with sitagliptin 50 mg once daily and 145 were treated with  sitagliptin 100 mg once daily. Mean baseline HbA(1c) ranged from 7.4% to 7.8% per  trial. Before matching, significant (p < 0.05) cross-trial differences included  lower mean HbA(1c) (by 0.2-0.3%) and higher FPG (by 5-13 mg/dL) in vildagliptin  trials. After matching, all baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment  groups. Combining matched trials, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily was associated with  significantly greater absolute HbA(1c) reduction by 0.28% compared with sitagliptin  50 mg once daily (95% CI 0.15, 0.41; p < 0.001) and by 0.35% compared with  sitagliptin 100 mg once daily (95% CI 0.07, 0.62; p = 0.013). CONCLUSION: After  adjusting for baseline differences among trials of vildagliptin and sitagliptin in  Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily was  associated with significantly greater HbA(1c) reduction than sitagliptin 50 mg or  100 mg once daily.",NA,"Signorovitch, James E Wu, Eric Q Swallow, Elyse Kantor, Evan Fan, Liangyi Gruenberger, Jean-Bernard",Signorovitch JE Wu EQ Swallow E Kantor E Fan L Gruenberger JB,NA,"Analysis Group Inc., Boston, MA 02199, USA. jsignorovitch@analysisgroup.com",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,New Zealand,Clin Drug Investig,Clinical drug investigation,9504817,IM,NA,NA,2011/08/09 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,2011/08/09 06:00,2011/08/09 06:00 [entrez] 2011/08/09 06:00 [pubmed] 2011/12/13 00:00 [medline],5 [pii] 10.2165/11592490-000000000-00000 [doi],ppublish,Clin Drug Investig. 2011;31(9):665-74. doi: 10.2165/11592490-000000000-00000.,31,9,665-74,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20111128,0 (Blood Glucose) 0 (Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors) 0 (Glycated Hemoglobin A) 0 (Nitriles) 0 (Pyrazines) 0 (Pyrrolidines) 0 (Triazoles) I6B4B2U96P (Vildagliptin) PJY633525U (Adamantane) TS63EW8X6F (Sitagliptin Phosphate),"Adamantane/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use Aged Blood Glucose/drug effects Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Female Glycated Hemoglobin A/metabolism Humans Japan Male Middle Aged Nitriles/*therapeutic use Pyrazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Pyrrolidines/*therapeutic use Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Sitagliptin Phosphate Triazoles/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Vildagliptin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, these drugs have not been compared in  head-to-head trials. OBJECTIVE: To review systematically the evidence of clinical  effectiveness of multikinase inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic renal cell  carcinoma (mRCC) and, via an indirect meta-analysis, to determine an optimal  treatment among these agents. METHODS: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE,  EMBASE, CANCERLIT, and Cochrane controlled trials register databases was performed.  All RCTs of multikinase inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib) used to  treat mRCC were included. The study selection, data extraction, and quality  assessment were performed independently by 2 reviewers, with all disagreements being  resolved by consensus. The effects of multikinase inhibitors on progression-free  survival (PFS) were compared using an indirect treatment comparison method with  INF-α or placebo as a comparator. RESULTS: Four studies were included. Two studies  examined sunitinib or sorafenib versus IFN-α, and the other 2 studies investigated  sorafenib or pazopanib versus placebo. Compared with placebo, 2 interventions  reported improvement for PFS (sorafenib: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.44, P = 0.01;  pazopanib: HR = 0.46, P = 0.0001), whereas only sunitinib improved PFS over IFN-α  (HR = 0.539, P = 0.001). An indirect comparison suggests that sunitinib is likely to  demonstrate greater clinical benefit than sorafenib in terms of PFS (HR = 0.47; 95%  CI, 0.316-0.713; P < 0.001), using IFN-α as the comparator. Sorafenib was not  statistically different from pazopanib using placebo as the comparator in the  indirect comparison (HR = 0.957; 95% CI, 0.657-1.39; P = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Some  multikinase inhibitors have a favorably reported PFS for patients with mRCC compared  with results using IFN-α or placebo. Our findings suggest that sunitinib might offer  some clinical benefit over sorafenib in terms of PFS. No statistical difference was  found between sorafenib and pazopanib treatments. However, these conclusions are  based on 2 indirect comparisons of single RCTs. More RCTs are required to confirm  these findings and investigate the clinical effectiveness of multikinase inhibitors  in the treatment of mRCC.",Copyright © 2011.

We previously devised a murine metal allergy model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as  an adjuvant. LPS reduces the minimum allergy-inducing concentration (MAIC) of metals  at both the sensitization and the elicitation steps. OBJECTIVES: Here, we examined  allergic cross-reactivity among some metals in this murine model, and compared the  effects of ultrapure (99·99% or more) and low purity (93-99%) metal salts. METHODS:  A mixture of a metal salt and Escherichia coli LPS was injected intraperitoneally  into BALB/c mice (0·25 mL per mouse). Ten days later, metal salts (with or without  LPS) were challenged to ear pinnas (20 μL per ear), and ear swelling was measured.  RESULTS: Among the ultrapure metals tested (Ni, Pd, Co, Cr, Cu and Au), only Ni and  Pd cross-reacted. In this cross-reaction, their MAICs were at the same level.  Combined challenge with Ni and Pd at sub-MAICs (but not at higher concentrations)  produced an additive effect. Surprisingly, mice sensitized with low purity Ni  reacted to all the tested low purity metals (Ni, Pd, Co and Cr), and the low purity  metals were shown to contain contaminant metals. CONCLUSIONS: In our model: (i) Ni  and Pd (members of the same group in the periodic table of elements) cross-react  with each other, (ii) this cross-reaction may depend on true and false antigens  forming metal-protein complexes with similar spatial geometries, (iii) Co, Cr, Cu  and Au do not cross-react with each other, (iv) in low purity materials, trace  contaminant metals may be sufficient to evoke allergy, and thus (v) high purity  metal salts should be considered for use in clinical patch testing.",© 2011 The Authors.

METHODS: An initial literature search revealed no suitable head-to-head trials  between budesonide/formoterol and salmeterol/fluticasone and therefore a systematic  review was conducted to find randomised controlled trials providing data for input  into an adjusted indirect comparison of the two combination treatments using placebo  as a common comparator. The Bucher adjusted indirect comparison method was used to  calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Eight  salmeterol/fluticasone trials and four budesonide/formoterol trials were identified  as being relevant for the analyses. The proportion of patients experiencing a  pneumonia adverse event was significantly lower with budesonide/formoterol than  salmeterol/fluticasone (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.80). The  proportion of patients experiencing a pneumonia serious adverse event was also  significantly lower with budesonide/formoterol than salmeterol/fluticasone (odds  ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.86). However, there were too few events  to draw any firm conclusions on pneumonia-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The  results of the indirect comparison support the hypothesis that budesonide/formoterol  is associated with fewer pneumonia events than salmeterol/fluticasone in chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease. The limitations of the analysis are that the results  from a single study, TORCH, have a large bearing on the overall findings of the  analysis, and that there is heterogeneity in the length and the dosing of the  included studies, although it does not appear that heterogeneity affected the  reported results. Another important limitation is the lack of predefined diagnostic  standards for pneumonia in these studies.",© 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.,"Halpin, D M G Gray, J Edwards, S J Morais, J Singh, D",Halpin DM Gray J Edwards SJ Morais J Singh D,NA,"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital, Exeter, UK.",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Meta-Analysis Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Systematic Review",NA,India,Int J Clin Pract,International journal of clinical practice,9712381,IM,NA,NA,2011/06/17 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00 [entrez] 2011/06/17 06:00 [pubmed] 2012/01/10 06:00 [medline],10.1111/j.1742-1241.2011.02685.x [doi],ppublish,Int J Clin Pract. 2011 Jul;65(7):764-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2011.02685.x.,65,7,764-74,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20120109,0 (Androstadienes) 0 (Bronchodilator Agents) 0 (Ethanolamines) 0 (Glucocorticoids) 51333-22-3 (Budesonide) 6EW8Q962A5 (Salmeterol Xinafoate) CUT2W21N7U (Fluticasone) QF8SVZ843E (Albuterol) W34SHF8J2K (Formoterol Fumarate),"Administration, Inhalation Albuterol/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives Androstadienes/administration & dosage Bronchodilator Agents/*administration & dosage Budesonide/administration & dosage Drug Therapy, Combination/methods Ethanolamines/administration & dosage Fluticasone Formoterol Fumarate Glucocorticoids/*administration & dosage Humans Pneumonia/mortality/*prevention & control Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*drug therapy/mortality Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Salmeterol Xinafoate Sample Size",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the absence of randomized, controlled trials involving a  direct comparison of all treatments of interest, indirect treatment comparisons and  network meta-analysis provide useful evidence for judiciously selecting the best  choice(s) of treatment. Mixed treatment comparisons, a special case of network  meta-analysis, combine direct and indirect evidence for particular pairwise  comparisons, thereby synthesizing a greater share of the available evidence than a  traditional meta-analysis. This report from the ISPOR Indirect Treatment Comparisons  Good Research Practices Task Force provides guidance on the interpretation of  indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis to assist policymakers and  health-care professionals in using its findings for decision making. We start with  an overview of how networks of randomized, controlled trials allow multiple  treatment comparisons of competing interventions. Next, an introduction to the  synthesis of the available evidence with a focus on terminology, assumptions,  validity, and statistical methods is provided, followed by advice on critically  reviewing and interpreting an indirect treatment comparison or network meta-analysis  to inform decision making.

767,21977547,NA,Publisher,NA,NA,2011 Jun,NA,NA,"PURPOSE: We compared the effectiveness and harms of anticonvulsants, tricyclic  antidepressants, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and the  lidocaine patchin adults with neuropathic pain. DATA SOURCES: To identify published  studies, we searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of  Effects, and reference lists of included studies. We also searched the US Food and  Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research website for additional  unpublished data and dossiers of information submitted by 5 pharmaceutical  manufacturers. REVIEW METHODS: Study selection, data abstraction, validity  assessment, grading the strength of the evidence, and data synthesis were all  carried out according to standard Drug Effectiveness Review Project review methods.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the strength of evidence evaluating the  comparative benefits or harms of these drugs to treat neuropathic pain was low to  moderate. Based on a small number of short-term trials directly comparing the drugs  in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, the  evidence did not support a statistically significant difference in response (50%  reduction in pain) or withdrawal due to adverse events with gabapentin, pregabalin,  and lamotrigine compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Oralpregabalin was similar  to lidocaine 5% medicated patchin rate of response, but resulted in more patients  withdrawing due to an adverse event. Adjusted indirect comparisons of  placebo-controlled trials suggested that duloxetine, pregabalin, and gabapentin were  superior to lacosamide and lamotrigine, but no difference in withdrawal from study  due to adverse events was found. In these analyses, differences were not found  between pregabalin, duloxetine, and gabapentin or comparisons of 5% lidocaine patch  and amitriptyline or gabapentin. Tricyclic antidepressants caused more dry mouth  than pregabalin or gabapentin while gabapentin and pregabalin resulted in higher  rates of ataxia. In patients with cancer-related neuropathic pain who were taking  opioids, there was no difference in pain relief with low-dose gabapentin compared  with low-dose imipramine. Monotherapy with either drug was insufficient for pain  relief. In patients with spinal cord injury, gabapentin was more effective for pain  relief than amitriptyline. The difference was significant only in the subgroup of  patients with the highest levels of depression. In patients with central poststroke  pain, there was no difference between amitriptyline and carbamazepine. There was no  direct evidence in patients with HIV-associated neuropathic pain, multiple  sclerosis, complex regional pain syndrome, postmastectomy pain syndrome, phantom  limb pain, or traumatic nerve injury pain. Evidence for comparative effectiveness in  patients with types of neuropathic pain other than diabetic or postherpetic was  insufficient to assess comparative safety. Post hoc analyses have not found older  age to have an impact on response or treatment-emergent adverse events with  duloxetine. Combination therapy with duloxetine and pregabalin; lidocaine patch and  pregabalin; or gabapentin with imipramine, nortriptyline, or venlafaxine may have  had a potential benefit compared with monotherapy, but there was an increased risk  of adverse events.",Copyright © 2011 by Oregon Health & Science University.,"Selph, Shelley Carson, Susan Fu, Rongwei Thakurta, Sujata Low, Allison McDonagh, Marian",Selph S Carson S Fu R Thakurta S Low A McDonagh M,NA,NA,eng,NA,Review Book,NA,Portland (OR),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2011/06/01 00:00,NA,2011/06/01 00:00,NA,NBK61823 [bookaccession],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon Health & Science University,Drug Class Reviews,Drug Class Review: Neuropathic Pain: Final Update 1 Report,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The current analysis indirectly compares the overall survival (OS)  benefit of everolimus and sorafenib as second-line treatment options. RESEARCH  DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-arm sorafenib study is selected as a basis to match an  everolimus sunitinib-refractory subpopulation of the RECORD-1 trial. Only patients  with clear cell histology are included. An adjusted matching approach is taken where  1000 repeated random samples matched to the sorafenib population on risk score  distribution are produced, and a 95% CI around the mean of all sampled median OS is  generated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures include adjusted median  OS and progression-free survival. RESULTS: In all, 45 clear cell histology sorafenib  patients and 1000 samples of N=41 sunitinib-refractory everolimus patients are  considered for analysis. After adjusted matching, the estimated median OS benefit is  32.0 [corrected] weeks (95% CI: 22, 64) and 81.5 weeks (95% CI:78, 86) for sorafenib  and everolimus patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that  sunitinib-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients treated with  everolimus may experience significantly improved OS outcomes compared to those  treated with sorafenib. However, because this is not a randomized controlled trial,  the results should be interpreted as those from an observational study.","© 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.","Di Lorenzo, Giuseppe Casciano, Roman Malangone, Elisabetta Buonerba, Carlo Sherman, Steven Willet, Jacob Wang, Xufang Liu, Zhimei De Placido, Sabino",Di Lorenzo G Casciano R Malangone E Buonerba C Sherman S Willet J Wang X Liu Z De Placido S,NA,"University Federico II of Napoli, Medical Oncology, Endocrinology and Oncology  Department, Naples, Italy.",eng,NA,"Clinical Trial, Phase II Clinical Trial, Phase III Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20110521,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,IM,NA,NA,2011/05/24 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez] 2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed] 2011/09/29 06:00 [medline],10.1517/14656566.2011.587119 [doi],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2011 Jul;12(10):1491-7. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2011.587119.

METHODS: Survival outcomes were compared between  subgroups of East Asian patients receiving treatments of either bevacizumab +  cisplatin-based chemotherapy or pemetrexed + cisplatin using a matching-adjusted  indirect comparison approach. Patient-level data were used to derive a new group  with similar characteristics compared to those reported in a phase III clinical  trial evaluating pemetrexed + cisplatin therapy. Exclusions to the SAiL data  included those with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status  (PS) of 2, those with mixed cell histology, non-East Asians and those who did not  receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In total 1000 samples of the pre-matched  analysis set of the SAiL data were selected that resulted in equal distributions of  the ECOG PS and gender matching variables selected and evaluated for a  progression-free survival (PFS) outcome. RESULTS: Median PFS was longer for patients  treated with bevacizumab-based therapy (7.4 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]:  6.7-8.2) versus pemetrexed + cisplatin (6.4 months; 95% CI N/A) among non-squamous  East Asian NSCLC patients.

In the absence of evidence from head-to-head trials, an adjusted indirect treatment  comparison (ITC) approach was selected to compare these treatments. METHODS: BevCG  and CP treatments have been compared in their relative effects versus their common  comparator, the CG treatment. Outcomes from the ITC were used in a statistical model  to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the two  treatments. The non-proportional hazards log-logistic, accelerated failure time  model was selected as it provided the best fit. The ITC hazard ratio (HR) was  conservatively adjusted to match what was observed between the cumulative hazard  functions until the end of the Avastin in Lung trial follow-up period. RESULTS: The  ITC analysis suggests that patients treated with Bev-based treatment can expect more  favorable outcomes in terms of both PFS and OS (PFS HR=0.71 and OS HR=0.41).  Probabilistic sensitivity analyses of PFS and OS HR showed that HR values below 1  are likely to occur in 82% of patients for PFS HR and in 94% of patients for OS HR.

This assumption  is implausible when hazard functions intersect, and can have a huge impact on  decisions based on comparisons of expected survival, such as cost-effectiveness  analysis. METHODS: As an alternative to network meta-analysis of survival data in  which the treatment effect is represented by the constant hazard ratio, a  multi-dimensional treatment effect approach is presented. With fractional  polynomials the hazard functions of interventions compared in a randomized  controlled trial are modeled, and the difference between the parameters of these  fractional polynomials within a trial are synthesized (and indirectly compared)  across studies. RESULTS: The proposed models are illustrated with an analysis of  survival data in non-small-cell lung cancer. Fixed and random effects first and  second order fractional polynomials were evaluated.

The purpose of this study was to indirectly compare rates of major  molecular response (MMR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival by  month 12 with nilotinib and dasatinib treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP. METHODS:  Individual patient data from a randomized trial of nilotinib vs. imatinib (ENESTnd)  and published summary data from a separate randomized trial of dasatinib vs.  imatinib (DASISION) were utilized. A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was  conducted by weighting individual patients treated with nilotinib to match baseline  characteristics reported for dasatinib-treated patients, including age, gender, ECOG  performance status and hematology lab values. After matching, efficacy outcomes were  compared for patients treated with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily vs. dasatinib 100 mg  once daily. Patients randomized to imatinib 400 mg once daily in each trial were  used to assess the adequacy of the matching. RESULTS: Before matching, patients  randomized to nilotinib in ENESTnd (n = 273) were older, with a lower median  platelet count and more favorable performance status compared to patients randomized  to dasatinib in DASISION (n = 259). After matching, all baseline characteristics  were balanced across treatment groups. Matched patients treated with nilotinib vs.  dasatinib experienced significantly higher rates of MMR (56.8 vs. 45.9%, p = 0.014)  and overall survival (99.5 vs. 97.3%, p = 0.046) and numerically higher rates of PFS  (98.8 vs. 96.5%).

RESULTS: We identified published results of randomized controlled trials  from the United States in which HIV-infected patients received rifabutin,  azithromycin, clarithromycin, or placebo for prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium  complex (MAC). We extracted the number of subjects, follow-up time, primary MAC  events, mean CD4 count, and proportion of subjects on mono or dual antiretroviral  therapy (ART) from each study. We derived the efficacy of each drug using adjusted  indirect comparisons and, when possible, by direct comparisons. Five articles  satisfied our inclusion criteria. Using direct comparison, we estimated the  efficacies of rifabutin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin compared to placebo to be  53% (95% CI, 48-61%), 66% (95% CI, 61-74%), and 66% (95% CI, 60-81%), respectively.  Using adjusted indirect calculations, the efficacy of rifabutin compared to placebo  ranged from 41% to 44%. The adjusted indirect efficacies of clarithromycin and  azithromycin were estimated to be 73% and 72%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate  estimates of specific drug dosages as compared to placebo are important for policy  and implementation research.

This has  resulted in failure to directly identify the best treatment with standard methods.  Mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis allows one to perform simultaneous  inference regarding all treatments and select the best among them. STUDY DESIGN AND  SETTING: We applied MTC models to the Meta-Analyses of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy  in HNC, which pooled individual patient data concerning more than 24,000 patients  involved in 102 trials. Fixed- and random-effects models, models with or without  consistency factors, possibly adapted to multiarm trials are discussed. RESULTS:  Altered fractionated concomitant chemoradiotherapy (AF-CRT) leads to the highest  probability of survival in nonmetastatic HNC. The probability that AF-CRT is the  best treatment is 94% with random-effects models. There was no relevant  inconsistency. When only the most recent trials were selected, AF-CRT and  concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) were the two best treatments. AF-CRT remains  better than CRT but with a lower posterior probability. CONCLUSION: MTC is a  powerful method for investigating networks of randomized trials. Homogeneity,  similarity of trial designs, populations, and the consistency of the network should  be thoroughly checked.",Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify randomized controlled  trials that assessed the efficacy of anticytokine agents in combination with  conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) after 6 months of  treatment, using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, in  patients with RA who have shown inadequate response to DMARD including methotrexate.  Indirect treatment comparisons were carried out by a multiple-treatment Bayesian  random-effects metaanalysis. Data were analyzed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo  simulation. Noninferiority of CZP was assessed in comparison with a predefined  equivalence margin of 5%. RESULTS: Nineteen placebo-controlled studies were  identified: 14 evaluated the efficacy of 5 anti-TNF-α agents (infliximab,  etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, CZP) and 5 evaluated efficacy of 2  anti-interleukin agents (anakinra, tocilizumab). Every treatment showed significant  efficacy versus placebo in individual studies. The multiple-treatment metaanalysis  showed a highest OR for CZP on ACR20 response. Metaanalysis indicates that the  efficacy of CZP according to ACR20 response is superior to that of infliximab,  adalimumab, and anakinra, and equivalent or superior to that of etanercept,  golimumab, and tocilizumab. According to ACR50 response, the efficacy of CZP is  equivalent or superior to that of all other anticytokines.

A meta-analysis of  safety measured via discontinuation because of adverse events was also performed.  METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 21 clinical trials to estimate treatment  differences vs. placebo, separately, for duloxetine, fluoxetine, gabapentin,  milnacipran, pramipexole, pregabalin, either of two tricyclic antidepressants, and  tramadol plus paracetamol. Indirect treatment comparisons using mixed treatment  comparisons methodology were conducted for all pairwise comparisons. Pain response  was analyzed as improvement of at least 30%, and separately of 50%, from baseline.  RESULTS: When compared with placebo, statistically significant pain responses  (improvement of 30% and 50%) were observed for patients treated with duloxetine,  milnacipran 200 mg/day, pregabalin 300 or 450 mg/day, and tramadol plus paracetamol.  Treatment with fluoxetine, gabapentin, or milnacipran 100 mg/day resulted in  significant findings for the 30% improvement in pain response. The meta-analysis  showed a statistically increased risk of discontinuation because of adverse events  for milnacipran 100 and 200 mg/day (both P < 0.001), and pregabalin 300 and 450  mg/day (P = 0.009 and P < 0.001, respectively). All other treatments, except  fluoxetine, showed numerically increased risk over placebo for discontinuation  because of adverse events.

We aimed to  systematically compare their relative benefits and harms through meta-analysis, and  adjusted indirect comparison. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, trial registries  and regulatory documents through May 2009 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of  dabigatran (150 and 220 mg daily) and rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) compared with  enoxaparin (40-60 mg daily) in elective orthopaedic surgery. We used random effects  meta-analysis to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals  (95% CI) for the outcomes of total venous thromboembolism, VTE (deep venous  thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism and all-cause mortality), and haemorrhagic  adverse events (major and clinically relevant non-major bleeds). Adjusted indirect  comparison was used for the pooled RRs of dabigatran and rivaroxaban with enoxaparin  as the common control. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban was superior to enoxaparin for the  prevention of venous thromoboembolism (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43-0.73, P<0.0001), with a  trend for increased haemorrhage (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94-1.69, P=0.13). Dabigatran was  not superior to enoxaparin for prevention of VTE (RR 1.12, 95% 0.97-1.29, P=0.12),  and did not reduce haemorrhage risk (RR 1.10, 95% 0.90-1.35, P=0.32). Adjusted  indirect comparison showed that rivaroxaban was superior to dabigatran in preventing  VTE, RR 0.50 (95% CI 0.37-0.68), but with a slight trend towards increased  haemorrhage RR 1.14 (95% CI 0.80-1.64).

We hypothesize that VGC 450 mg daily  may be as effective as and safer than 900 mg daily. METHODS: studies evaluating  valganciclovir 900 mg and 450 mg daily against controls were evaluated. Direct  comparisons were performed by random-effects models and indirect comparisons by the  Bucher method. RESULTS: twelve trials with VGC 900 mg (1543 patients) and 8 trials  with VGC 450 mg (1531 patients) were included. The risk of CMV disease with VGC 900  mg versus controls was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI], .64-1.76; P = .81;  I2=29%) and with VGC 450 mg vs controls .77 (95%CI, .49-1.18; P = .23; I2=24%). The  risk of leucopenia was 5.24 (2.09-13.15; P = .0004; I2=44%) for VGC 900 mg versus  controls and 1.58 (.96-2.61; P = .07; I2=36%) for VGC 450 mg versus controls; the  risk for acute allograft rejection was 1.71 (.45, -6.50; P = .43) for VGC 900 mg and  .80 (.50-1.28; P = .34) for VGC 450 mg. Adjusted indirect comparison between VGC 900  mg and VGC 450mg: the risk for CMV disease was not significantly different: odds  ratio (OR), 1.38 (.84-2.25); P = .19; the risk of leucopenia was significantly  increased with VGC 900 mg: 3.32 (1.76-6.26); P = .0002; and the risk of rejection  was significantly increased with VGC 900 mg: 2.56 (1.50-4.53); P = .0005. Results  remained consistent after adjustments by allograft, CMV control strategy, and  immunosuppression.

DESIGN: Comparative effectiveness analysis using an indirect treatment  comparison (ITC) method in a Bayesian framework. PATIENTS: Adults with rheumatoid  arthritis who had been enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and had never  failed biologic DMARD therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two random-effects  logistic regression models, representing 6 and 12 months of treatment, were created  using RCTs identified in a literature search. Twenty-three RCTs (11,589 patients)  were included in the 6-month model and 10 RCTs (6051 patients) in the 12-month  model. Nine biologic DMARDs in five therapeutic drug classes were included in the  6-month model, and six biologic DMARDs in three classes were included in the  12-month model. Our efficacy end point was the American College of Rheumatology 50%  improvement criteria. In the 6-month model, all biologic DMARDs and methotrexate  were significantly more efficacious than placebo and ranked in the following order:  certolizumab (median log odds ratio [OR] 2.6), tocilizumab (1.7), rituximab (1.6),  infliximab (1.6), etanercept (1.4), adalimumab (1.4), golimumab (1.4), abatacept  (1.2), anakinra (1.0), and methotrexate (0.8). Of 45 pairwise comparisons,  certolizumab was significantly more efficacious than methotrexate, but no other  comparisons were significant. The rank order in the 12-month analysis was  certolizumab (median log OR 2.0), rituximab (2.0), adalimumab (1.4), infliximab  (1.4), etanercept (0.9), abatacept (0.6), and methotrexate (0.8). Of the 21 pairwise  comparisons, none were significant. The results of the model using therapeutic class  revealed that each class was more efficacious than placebo. In pairwise comparisons,  each class was more efficacious than methotrexate, but none was more efficacious  than another. CONCLUSION: Use of emerging ITC methods enabled us to compare the  efficacy of biologic DMARDs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the absence  of direct head-to-head comparison trials. Our methods enabled us to rank order these  treatments. Further analyses by drug and by therapeutic class suggest that biologic  DMARDs are similarly efficacious.",NA,"Devine, Emily Beth Alfonso-Cristancho, Rafael Sullivan, Sean D",Devine EB Alfonso-Cristancho R Sullivan SD,NA,"Pharmaceutical Outcomes Research and Policy Program, Department of Medical Education  and Biomedical Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington  98195-7630, USA. bdevine@uw.edu",eng,NA,Comparative Study Journal Article,NA,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,IM,NA,NA,2010/12/25 06:00,2011/07/02 06:00,2010/12/25 06:00,2010/12/25 06:00 [entrez] 2010/12/25 06:00 [pubmed] 2011/07/02 06:00 [medline],10.1592/phco.31.1.39 [pii] 10.1592/phco.31.1.39 [doi],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2011 Jan;31(1):39-51. doi: 10.1592/phco.31.1.39.,31,1,39-51,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20110701,"0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal) 0 (Antirheumatic Agents) YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)","Adult Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Antirheumatic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy Humans Meta-Analysis as Topic Methotrexate/*therapeutic use Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Treatment Failure Treatment Outcome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While all  biologicals have proven effective in trials, very limited direct comparisons are  available. The objective of the present work was to compare the efficacy of  biologicals (anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents, rituximab, abatacept,  tocilizumab) in patients with RA with active disease and (i) an inadequate response  (IR) to methotrexate (IR-MTX), (ii) an IR to anti-TNF agents (IR-anti-TNFs) using  indirect comparisons. METHODS: Randomised clinical trials were identified examining  the efficacy of a biological agent in RA at 6 months in patients with an IR-MTX or  with an IR-anti-TNF. To compare the relative efficacy of biologicals, adjusted  indirect comparison meta-analytic methods to estimate the ORs of achieving a 50%  improvement according to American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR50) response  at 6 months were used. RESULTS: A total of 18 published trials and 1 abstract were  included in the analyses. In IR-MTX, anti-TNFs had the same probability of reaching  an ACR50 compared to 'non-anti-TNF biologicals' taken together (OR 1.30, 95 % CI  0.91 to 1.86). However, when compared to specific biological agents, anti-TNFs  demonstrated a higher probability of reaching an ACR50 than abatacept (OR 1.52, 95 %  CI 1.0 to 2.28), but not in comparison to rituximab and tocilizumab. In IR-anti-TNF,  no significant differences existed between rituximab, tocilizumab, abatacept and  golimumab. [corrected] CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials  of patients with IR-MTX, anti-TNFs demonstrated a higher probability of achieving an  ACR50 response than abatacept.

METHODS: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, SCOPUS,  www.clinicalstudyresults.org and www.clinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized  pharmacological placebo-controlled trials until 30 May 2010. Outcomes of interest  were symptom reduction [pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and reduced health-related  quality of life (HRQOL)] and acceptability (total drop-out rates). We performed a  meta-analysis of each drug vs placebo using a random-effects model and adjusted  indirect analyses of the three drugs. Methodological quality was assessed by the  Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Ten AMT studies (612 patients), four DLX  studies (1411 patients) and five MLN studies (4129 patients) met the inclusion  criteria. The reported methodological quality of most AMT trials was poor, that of  DLX and MLN were high. The three drugs were superior to placebo except DLX for  fatigue, MLN for sleep disturbance and AMT for HRQOL. The significant effects of AMT  and DLX were small and those of MLN not substantial. In adjusted indirect  comparisons, AMT was superior to DLX and MLN in reduction of pain, sleep  disturbances, fatigue and limitations of HRQOL. DLX was superior to MLN in reducing  pain, sleep disturbances and limitations of HRQOL. MLN was superior to DLX in  reducing fatigue. There were no significant differences in acceptability of the  three drugs.

Evidence from comparisons of competing  interventions is increasingly important, although head-to-head studies are seldom  available to inform decisions. In this article, we describe the simulated treatment  comparison (STC) approach to incorporating 'missing arms' into an existing trial.  This approach yields a simulated head-to-head trial and can address many of the  differences among source trials. It provides inputs for economic models and can  inform decision makers until actual trial data are available. A simulation is  constructed to replicate an index trial, including enrolment, randomization and  follow-up of patients. The simulation is driven by predictive equations derived from  the index trial. Separate data for the comparators are used to calibrate the index  equations to reflect the alternative interventions. The simulation is used to add  the missing arms to the index trial and estimate the results that would have been  obtained in a head-to-head trial. The STC can also be used to estimate results in  various settings and populations and to explore variations in the trial design.

Indirect cross-trial  treatment comparisons are possible, but can be biased by cross-trial differences in  patient characteristics. Using only published aggregate data, adjustment for such  biases may be impossible. Although individual patient data (IPD) would permit  adjustment, they are rarely available for all trials. However, many researchers have  the opportunity to access IPD for trials of one treatment, a new drug for example,  but only aggregate data for trials of comparator treatments. We propose a method  that leverages all available data in this setting by adjusting average patient  characteristics in trials with IPD to match those reported for trials without IPD.  Treatment outcomes, including continuous, categorical and censored time-to-event  outcomes, can then be compared across balanced trial populations. The proposed  method is illustrated by a comparison of adalimumab and etanercept for the treatment  of psoriasis. IPD from trials of adalimumab versus placebo (n = 1025) were  re-weighted to match the average baseline characteristics reported for a trial of  etanercept versus placebo (n = 330). Re-weighting was based on the estimated  propensity of enrolment in the adalimumab versus etanercept trials. Before matching,  patients in the adalimumab trials had lower mean age, greater prevalence of  psoriatic arthritis, less prior use of systemic treatment or phototherapy, and a  smaller mean percentage of body surface area affected than patients in the  etanercept trial. After matching, these and all other available baseline  characteristics were well balanced across trials. Symptom improvements of ≥75% and  ≥90% (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score at week 12)  were experienced by an additional 17.2% and 14.8% of adalimumab-treated patients  compared with the matched etanercept-treated patients (respectively, both p <  0.001). Mean percentage PASI score improvements from baseline were also greater for  adalimumab than for etanercept at weeks 4, 8 and 12 (all p < 0.05). Matching  adjustment ensured that this indirect comparison was not biased by differences in  mean baseline characteristics across trials, supporting the conclusion that  adalimumab was associated with significantly greater symptom reduction than  etanercept for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.",NA,"Signorovitch, James E Wu, Eric Q Yu, Andrew P Gerrits, Charles M Kantor, Evan Bao, Yanjun Gupta, Shiraz R Mulani, Parvez M",Signorovitch JE Wu EQ Yu AP Gerrits CM Kantor E Bao Y Gupta SR Mulani PM,NA,"Analysis Group Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, USA. jsignorovitch@analysisgroup.com",eng,NA,"Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,NA,NA,NA,2010/09/14 06:00,2010/12/29 06:00,2010/09/14 06:00,2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez] 2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed] 2010/12/29 06:00 [medline],17 [pii] 10.2165/11538370-000000000-00000 [doi],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2010;28(10):935-45. doi: 10.2165/11538370-000000000-00000.,28,10,935-45,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20101228,"0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents) 0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal) 0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized) 0 (Immunoglobulin G) 0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor) FYS6T7F842 (Adalimumab) OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)","Adalimumab Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized Comparative Effectiveness Research/*methods Etanercept Humans Immunoglobulin G/*therapeutic use Psoriasis/*drug therapy Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*therapeutic use",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent data suggest the superiority  of prasugrel or ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. However, there is no  comparison of prasugrel vs. ticagrelor. We performed an adjusted indirect  meta-analysis comparing prasugrel vs. ticagrelor for acute coronary syndromes  (ACSs). METHODS: Randomized trials were searched in PubMed. The primary end-point  was the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. Odds ratios (OR)  were computed (95% confidence intervals). RESULTS: Three trial (32,893) patients  were included. Overall, either prasugrel or ticagrelor appeared significantly  superior to clopidogrel for the 12-month risk of death, MI or stroke (OR=0.83  [0.77-0.89], p<0.001), death (OR=0.83 [0.74-0.93], p=0.001), MI (OR=0.79  [0.73-0.86], p<0.001), and stent thrombosis (OR=0.61 [0.51-0.74], p<0.001), without  any significant difference in stroke or major bleeding (both p>0.05), despite more  frequent drug discontinuation (OR=1.12 [1.05-1.19], p<0.001). Head-to-head  comparison of prasugrel vs. ticagrelor showed no significant differences in overall  death, MI, stroke, or their composite (all p>0.05). Prasugrel was associated with a  significantly lower risk of stent thrombosis (OR=0.64 [0.43-0.93], p=0.020).  Ticagrelor was associated with a significantly lower risk of any major bleeding  (OR=1.43 [1.10-1.85], p=0.007), and major bleeding associated with bypass grafting  (OR=4.30 [1.73-10.6], p=0.002). However, the more clinically relevant risk of major  bleeding not related to bypass surgery was similar with either prasugrel or  ticagrelor (OR=1.06 [0.77-1.45], p=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Prasugrel and ticagrelor are  superior to clopidogrel for ACS. Head-to-head comparison suggests similar efficacy  and safety of prasugrel and ticagrelor, but prasugrel appears more protective from  stent thrombosis, while causing more bleedings.",Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We previously found  that lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a cell-surface component of gram-negative bacteria)  markedly promotes Ni allergy in a murine model. Establishing the minimum  concentration or amount of Ni needed to induce allergic responses may help us to  prevent or reduce such responses. OBJECTIVES: Using the above murine model, we  examined the influence of LPS on the minimum allergy-inducing concentrations of Ni  (Ni-MAICs) at the sensitization step and at the elicitation step. METHODS: BALB/c  mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture containing various  concentrations of LPS and NiCl(2). Ten days later, their ear pinnas were challenged  intradermally with a mixture containing various concentrations of LPS and NiCl(2),  and ear swelling was measured. RESULTS: Without LPS, the Ni-MAICs at the  sensitization and elicitation steps were around 1×10(-2) mol L(-1) and 1×10(-5) mol  L(-1) , respectively. Sensitization with NiCl(2) + LPS did not alter the value at  elicitation. Surprisingly, LPS markedly reduced these Ni-MAICs (to around 1×10(-6)  molL(-1) at sensitization, with 25 μg mL(-1) LPS, and 1×10(-12) mol L(-1) at  elicitation, with 0·5 μg mL(-1) LPS). The effect of LPS depended on its  concentration and the timing of its injection. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest  that: (i) Ni-MAIC is higher at sensitization than at elicitation; (ii) once  sensitization is established, Ni allergy can easily be induced by a low  concentration of Ni; and (iii) a bacterial milieu or infection may greatly  facilitate the establishment and elicitation of Ni allergy.",© 2010 The Authors.

As no head-to-head comparison of these treatments exists,  this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of the two treatments using an  indirect treatment comparison approach. An indirect comparison on progression-free  survival (PFS) was performed for two relevant randomised controlled trials using a  well-accepted adjusted indirect comparison method. The results were used in a  statistical disease model (Markov model) to extrapolate the long-term effectiveness  of the two treatments. A hazard ratio of 0.83 for PFS for bevacizumab plus cisplatin  and gemcitabine, was calculated suggesting that this treatment is associated with a  17% lower risk of disease progression and death compared with pemetrexed plus  cisplatin treatment. The Markov model predicted that bevacizumab plus cisplatin and  gemcitabine resulted in 2.5 months additional PFS and overall survival compared with  pemetrexed plus cisplatin. Based on this analysis bevacizumab plus cisplatin and  gemcitabine is more effective than pemetrexed plus cisplatin for patients with  advanced non-squamous NSCLC and should be considered as one of the preferred  targeted treatments of choice for these patients.",Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of data  from individual patients, with direct and indirect comparisons made on the primary  outcome measure of patients' dissatisfaction. DATA SOURCES: Data were sought from  the 30 randomised controlled trials identified after a comprehensive search of the  Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases, reference lists, and  contact with experts. Raw data were available from 2814 women randomised into 17  trials (seven trials including 1359 women for first v second generation endometrial  destruction; six trials including 1042 women for hysterectomy v first generation  endometrial destruction; one trial including 236 women for hysterectomy v Mirena;  three trials including 177 women for second generation endometrial destruction v  Mirena). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials  comparing hysterectomy, first and second generation endometrial destruction, and  Mirena for women with heavy menstrual bleeding unresponsive to other medical  treatment. RESULTS: At around 12 months, more women were dissatisfied with outcome  with first generation hysteroscopic techniques than with hysterectomy (13% v 5%;  odds ratio 2.46, 95% confidence interval 1.54 to 3.9, P<0.001), but hospital stay  (weighted mean difference 3.0 days, 2.9 to 3.1 days, P<0.001) and time to resumption  of normal activities (5.2 days, 4.7 to 5.7 days, P<0.001) were longer for  hysterectomy. Unsatisfactory outcomes were comparable with first and second  generation techniques (odds ratio 1.2, 0.9 to 1.6, P=0.2), although second  generation techniques were quicker (weighted mean difference 14.5 minutes, 13.7 to  15.3 minutes, P<0.001) and women recovered sooner (0.48 days, 0.20 to 0.75 days,  P<0.001), with fewer procedural complications. Indirect comparison suggested more  unsatisfactory outcomes with second generation techniques than with hysterectomy  (11% v 5%; odds ratio 2.3, 1.3 to 4.2, P=0.006). Similar estimates were seen when  Mirena was indirectly compared with hysterectomy (17% v 5%; odds ratio 2.2, 0.9 to  5.3, P=0.07), although this comparison lacked power because of the limited amount of  data available for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: More women are dissatisfied after  endometrial destruction than after hysterectomy. Dissatisfaction rates are low after  all treatments, and hysterectomy is associated with increased length of stay in  hospital and a longer recovery period.

The majority of the efficacy  evidence described in the manufacturer's submission is derived from a phase III  open-label randomised controlled trial (RCT) known as the JMDB trial. The trial  achieved its primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of  pemetrexed/cisplatin to gemcitabine/cisplatin for overall survival in all patients  with NSCLC. Because no other studies were found comparing pemetrexed/cisplatin with  any other relevant comparator, additional efficacy evidence was presented from two  phase III RCTs comparing gemcitabine/cisplatin with gemcitabine/carboplatin and  docetaxel/cisplatin. The manufacturer's submission reported from its indirect  comparisons' analysis that median overall survival and progression-free survival and  tumour response rates were more favourable for pemetrexed/cisplatin than for any  other comparator. The manufacturer did not identify any published cost-effectiveness  analyses of pemetrexed for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC.  Therefore economic evidence was derived solely from a de novo economic model  developed by the manufacturer. A Markov model was developed to evaluate the  cost-effectiveness of pemetrexed/cisplatin compared to gemcitabine/cisplatin,  docetaxel/cisplatin and gemcitabine/carboplatin. The clinical data used in the  economic evaluation were primarily generated from the JMDB trial, with additional  data from the two further trials used in the indirect comparisons analysis. The ERG  identified a series of problems with this economic model. As a result, three  different versions of the model were submitted to NICE and considered by the ERG.  The ICERs estimated by this final version of the model ranged from 8056 pounds to  33,065 pounds per QALY, depending on the comparator, the population and the  application of a continuation rule. The ERG considered that the model required  extensive modification and redesign, and should be subjected to thorough validation  against the JMDB trial results. A full quality audit was also required as it was  likely that further model inconsistencies may be present that had not yet been  identified. The manufacturer subsequently included evidence in the form of three  cost effectiveness analyses (two models and an 'in-trial' analysis), stating that a  thorough validation process had been followed according to the NICE request. The  very short time available to the ERG to consider the new evidence precluded a  comprehensive assessment. Instead, the ERG chose to present a simple exploratory  analysis combining its own survival projections with key cost estimates obtained  from the JMDB trial individual patient data. Compared to gemcitabine, this resulted  in ICERs ranging from 17,162 pounds to 30,142 pounds per QALY, depending on the  patient population, the maximum number of cycles of chemotherapy and whether a cycle  based efficacy adjustment was applied or not. The guidance issued by NICE in  September 2009 states that pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is recommended  as an option for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or  metastatic NSCLC only if the histology of the tumour has been confirmed as  adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma.",NA,"Fleeman, N Bagust, A McLeod, C Greenhalgh, J Boland, A Dundar, Y Dickson, R Tudur Smith, C Davis, H Green, J Pearson, M",Fleeman N Bagust A McLeod C Greenhalgh J Boland A Dundar Y Dickson R Tudur Smith C Davis H Green J Pearson M,NA,"Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.  nigel.fleeman@liverpool.ac.uk",eng,NA,"Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review",NA,England,Health Technol Assess,"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",9706284,IM,NA,NA,2010/06/12 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,2010/05/29 06:00,2010/05/29 06:00 [entrez] 2010/06/12 06:00 [pubmed] 2011/02/08 06:00 [medline],10.3310/hta14Suppl1/07 [doi],ppublish,Health Technol Assess. 2010 May;14 Suppl 1:47-53. doi: 10.3310/hta14Suppl1/07.,14 Suppl 1,NA,47-53,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20110207,"0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic) 0 (Glutamates) 0 (Immunosuppressive Agents) 0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents) 0 (Taxoids) 04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed) 0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine) 15H5577CQD (Docetaxel) 5Z93L87A1R (Guanine) B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine) BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin) Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)","Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/economics/*therapeutic use Carboplatin/therapeutic use Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/economics/pathology Cisplatin/therapeutic use Cost-Benefit Analysis Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use Disease Progression Docetaxel Glutamates/economics/*therapeutic use Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/economics/therapeutic use Humans Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/economics/pathology Models, Economic Pemetrexed Quality-Adjusted Life Years Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/therapeutic use Taxoids/therapeutic use United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33

Evidence on the comparative benefits and harms is still accruing. The authors  searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and sought  unpublished data from the databases of FDA, US National Institutes for Health, and  Industry through May 2009 for randomized controlled trials. Outcomes of interest  were symptom reduction (pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, reduced  health-related quality of life), and adverse events. 17 studies with 7,739 patients  met the inclusion criteria. The 3 drugs were superior to placebo except DLX for  fatigue, MLN for sleep disturbance, and PGB for depressed mood. Adjusted indirect  comparisons indicated no significant differences for 30% pain relief and dropout  rates due to adverse events between the 3 drugs. Significant differences in average  symptom reduction were found: DLX and PGB were superior to MLN in reduction of pain  and sleep disturbances. DLX was superior to MLN and PGB in reducing depressed mood.  MLN and PGB were superior to DLX in reducing fatigue. The risk of headache and  nausea with DLX and MLN was higher compared with PGB. The risk of diarrhea was  higher with DLX compared to MLN and PGB. There is evidence for the short-term (up to  6 months) efficacy of DLX, MLN, and PGB. Differences with regard to the occurrence  of the key symptoms of FMS and to drug-specific adverse events may be relevant for  the choice of medication. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents comparative data on the  efficacy and harms of duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin in fibromyalgia  syndrome. The results can help clinicians in choosing medication since the 3 drugs  have different effects on the key symptoms of fibromyalgia syndrome and differences  in side effects, contraindications, and warnings.",Copyright (c) 2010 American Pain Society.

Percutaneous ethanol injection  (PEI) is less frequently used, and percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI) has been  mostly abandoned. Robust evidence showing benefit of one therapy versus another is  lacking. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence comparing RFA, PEI and PAI using  meta-analytical techniques. METHODS: Literature search was undertaken until December  2008 to identify comparative studies evaluating survival, recurrence, complete  necrosis of tumour and complications. Only randomized clinical trials and  quasi-randomized studies were included. Adjusted indirect comparisons were made when  direct comparative studies were insufficient. RESULTS: Eight studies were  identified: RFA vs. PEI (n=5), PAI vs. PEI (n=2) and RFA vs. PAI vs. PEI (n=1)  including 1035 patients with nine comparisons. RFA was superior to PEI for survival  (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35-0.78; p=0.001), complete necrosis of tumour and local  recurrence. For tumours 2 cm RFA was not significantly better than PEI. PAI did not  differ significantly from PEI for survival (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.23-1.33; p=0.18), and  local recurrence but required less sessions. PAI had similar outcomes, except local  recurrence, to RFA in the direct and indirect comparison. CONCLUSIONS: RFA seems to  be a superior ablative therapy than PEI for HCC, particularly for tumours >2 cm. PAI  did not differ significantly from PEI for all the outcomes evaluated. RFA and PAI  have similar survival rates. For tumours 2 cm outcome benefits comparing RFA and PEI  are similar. PAI needs re-evaluation versus both PEI and RFA for tumours 2 cm.",Copyright (c) 2010 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by  Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, we performed a  meta-analysis of randomised trials to evaluate the clinical outcome of DES as  compared with bare-metal stent (BMS) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).  METHODS AND RESULTS: We undertook a literature search until July 2009. Thirteen  clinical trials met inclusion criteria, with 7,244 patients enrolled. Up to 1-year,  patients treated with DES as compared with BMS experienced less target-vessel  revascularisation (TVR) (5.11% versus 11.19% respectively, p<0.00001) and recurrent  myocardial infarction rates (3.03% versus 3.70% respectively, p=0.02). In addition,  no significant differences were found in terms of cardiac death (2.80% versus 3.52%,  p=0.21) and stent thrombosis (2.65% versus 2.76%, p=0.37). Using the adjusted  indirect comparison, a significant difference between sirolimus- and  paclitaxel-eluting stent was found when TVR was evaluated (OR [95% CI] =0.59  [0.40-0.89], p=0.01), without differences in other clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:  In patients undergoing PCI for STEMI, treatment with DES is associated with  decreased TVR and myocardial infarction rates, without increasing cardiac death or  stent thrombosis occurrence.

In behavioral medicine, they are regularly used to derive clinical  practice guidelines. Owing to an increasing complexity of data integration methods  used, their interpretation has become a challenge to clinicians and researchers.  This review aims to provide an accessible introduction to recent advances in the  methodology and reporting style of quantitative reviews within the field of  behavioral medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: Meta-analytical findings are sensitive to the  precise methods used. State-of-the-art criteria for reporting of clinical trials and  meta-analyses have been put forward. Further adaptations of these criteria result  from recent meta-analyses of the placebo effect in clinical trials. There is a need  to carefully develop and evaluate methods to deal with patient dropout and missing  data. Useful methods to evaluate diagnostic test accuracy and meta-analytically  evaluate direct and indirect treatment comparisons have recently been developed.  SUMMARY: In the interdisciplinary field of behavioral medicine, meta-analyses are  applied to evaluate interventions, diagnostic instruments, and procedures, and to  derive evidence-based treatment recommendations. Criteria to improve reporting  quality and methods to control for potential biases have been adapted to meet the  requirements of research in behavioral medicine today.",NA,"Nestoriuc, Yvonne Kriston, Levente Rief, Winfried",Nestoriuc Y Kriston L Rief W,NA,"Department of Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Philipps-University  of Marburg, Germany. yn@staff.uni-marburg.de",eng,NA,Journal Article Review,NA,United States,Curr Opin Psychiatry,Current opinion in psychiatry,8809880,IM,NA,NA,2010/01/20 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/01/20 06:00,2010/01/20 06:00 [entrez] 2010/01/20 06:00 [pubmed] 2010/04/27 06:00 [medline],10.1097/YCO.0b013e328336666b [doi],ppublish,Curr Opin Psychiatry. 2010 Mar;23(2):145-50. doi: 10.1097/YCO.0b013e328336666b.,23,2,145-50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20100426,NA,"Behavioral Medicine/*statistics & numerical data *Data Interpretation, Statistical Evidence-Based Medicine/*standards/*statistics & numerical data Humans *Meta-Analysis as Topic",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,54
