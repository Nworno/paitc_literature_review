rayyan-804153286,Geometric approaches to assessing the numerical feasibility for conducting matching-adjusted indirect comparisons.,2022,3,28,Pharmaceutical statistics,1539-1612 (Electronic),,,,Glimm E and Yau L,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35343622/,eng,,England,"We discuss how to handle matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) from a data analyst's perspective. We introduce several multivariate data analysis methods to assess the appropriateness of MAIC for a given set of baseline characteristics. These methods focus on comparing the baseline variables used in the matching of a study that provides the summary statistics or aggregated data (AD) and a study that provides individual patient level data (IPD). The methods identify situations when no numerical solutions are possible with the MAIC method. This helps to avoid misleading results being produced. Moreover, it has been observed that sometimes contradicting results are reported by two sets of MAIC analyses produced by two teams, each having their own IPD and applying MAIC using the AD published by the other team. We show that an intrinsic property of the MAIC estimated weights can be a contributing factor for this phenomenon.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",35343622,

Naive, indirect comparisons may be inappropriate, as the study designs and patient populations could differ substantially. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC) can reduce many biases associated with indirect comparisons between studies. To determine the comparative efficacy and safety of lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) to tisagenlecleucel, we describe an unanchored MAIC of the pivotal studies TRANSCEND NHL 001 (TRANSCEND; NCT02631044; liso-cel) and JULIET (NCT02445248; tisagenlecleucel). METHODS: Individual patient data (IPD) from TRANSCEND were available to the authors; for the JULIET pivotal study, summary-level data from the published study were used. To balance the populations between two studies, IPD from TRANSCEND were adjusted to match the marginal distribution (e.g., mean, variance) of clinical factors among patients from JULIET. RESULTS: Results from the primary MAIC showed liso-cel had statistically significant greater efficacy than tisagenlecleucel (objective response rate: odds ratio [OR] = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63‒4.74; complete response rate: OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22‒3.30; progression-free survival: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47‒0.91; overall survival: HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47‒0.95). MAIC of safety outcomes showed lower ORs for all-grade and grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome, and grade ≥ 3 prolonged cytopenia for liso-cel when compared with tisagenlecleucel; there were no statistically significant differences detected for other safety outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this MAIC of two CAR T-cell therapies indicates liso-cel had favorable efficacy and a comparable or better safety profile relative to tisagenlecleucel.

Carfilzomib plus dexamethasone and daratumumab (KdD) and daratumumab plus bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) are lenalidomide-sparing triplet regimens that are approved for relapsed and/or refractory MM (R/RMM). In the absence of a head-to-head trial comparing these treatments, a matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of KdD versus DVd. Results showed that treatment with KdD decreases the risk of progression or death versus DVd (HR 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.90). Time-dependent analysis demonstrated a larger benefit for KdD after the first eight cycles. Unmatched subgroup analysis indicated that KdD may be particularly effective in lenalidomide-exposed and -refractory patients. The present analysis suggests that KdD improves outcomes compared with DVd in patients with R/RMM and may provide a rationale for a preferential treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",35289710,

We aimed to compare eluxadoline with antispasmodics in the treatment of IBS. Methods: We searched the OVID Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing eluxadoline or antispasmodics with placebo. The search was conducted from 1 January 1980, to 1 September 2020, without any language restrictions. The primary efficacy outcome was the relief of abdominal pain, defined by a reduction of pain scores of at least 30% from baseline. The secondary efficacy outcome was the relief of global IBS symptoms, defined by a composite response of a decrease in abdominal pain and improvement in stool consistency on the same day for at least 50% of the days assessed. The data were pooled using a random-effects model. Outcome estimates were pooled by using Risk Ratios (RRs) and P-scores. Results: Forty-two trials with 8,457 participants were included from 45 articles. Compared with placebo, each of drotaverine, pinaverium, alverine combined with simethicone (ACS) and eluxadoline 100 mg was highly effective in the relief of abdominal pain, with drotaverine [RR, 2.71 (95% CI, 1.70 to 4.32), P-score = 0.95] ranking first. Drotaverine, otilonium, cimetropium, pinaverium, and eluxadoline 100 mg had significantly high the relief of global IBS symptomss, for which drotaverine [RR, 2.45 (95% CI, 1.42 to 4.22), P-score = 0.95] was ranked first. No significant difference was found between these interventions. Pinaverium had a significantly higher the relief of global IBS symptoms than eluxadoline [RR, 1.72 (95% CI, 1.33 to 2.21)] on sensitivity analysis. However, no significant difference was found in the number of adverse events between each intervention and the placebo. Conclusion: Our network meta-analysis showed that eluxadoline 100 mg was at least as effective as antispasmodics in relieving abdominal pain in IBS. But eluxadoline had more reported adverse events. Antispasmodics are still the first choice for the treatment of IBS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",35281934,PMC8906885

METHODS: Two patient-level datasets were used: ANNEXA-4, a prospective, single-arm trial of patients taking apixaban or rivaroxaban who received andexanet alfa and ORANGE, a prospective, observational study of anticoagulated patients in UK hospitals, some of whom received PCC. Patients were propensity score matched based on demographic and clinical characteristics. Subgroup analyses were performed by bleed type (intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], gastrointestinal [GI], other). Relative risk (RR) of all-cause 30-day mortality was calculated. RESULTS: 322 ANNEXA-4 patients treated with andexanet alfa (mean age = 77.7 years; 64.9% ICH) were matched with 88 ORANGE patients treated with PCC (mean age = 74.9 years, 67.1% ICH). Adjusted 30-day mortality for patients treated with andexanet alfa (14.6%) was lower than patients treated with PCC (34.1%; RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.29-0.63). In the ICH subgroup, patients treated with andexanet alfa had lower mortality (15.3%) than patients treated with PCC (48.9%; RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.20-0.48). Mortality risk was lowest for patients in the GI subgroup but did not differ significantly by treatment (12.2% for andexanet alfa vs 25.0% for PCC; RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.21-1.16). CONCLUSIONS: In this propensity score-matched comparison across 2 independent datasets, adjusted 30-day mortality rates were lower for patients treated with andexanet alfa than in matched patients receiving PCC. This indirect comparison was limited in that it could not account for several highly predictive variables including GCS score, hematoma volume, and expected survival. Further research is warranted to confirm the mortality differences between reversal/replacement agents for DOAC-related bleeding.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",35280921,PMC8898077

This analysis aimed to compare time to deterioration (TTD) in QOL with transarterial radioembolization (TARE) and atezolizumab-bevacizumab, as well as sorafenib, in advanced and unresectable HCC. METHODS: Patient-level data from SARAH (TARE using SIR-Spheres(®) Y-90 resin microspheres [SIR-Spheres] versus sorafenib) and aggregate data from IMbrave150 (atezolizumab-bevacizumab versus sorafenib) randomized controlled trials were used to conduct an anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). Patients with a Child-Pugh score B in SARAH were excluded to align with exclusion criteria in IMbrave150. To identify potential effect modifiers for adjustment, the literature was searched and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were implemented using SARAH data. Patients from SARAH were then weighted to balance with baseline characteristics from IMbrave150. Median TTD in QOL and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated. RESULTS: Four potential effect modifiers were identified and used for adjustment: cause of disease (viral/non-viral), macrovascular invasion, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score, and alpha-fetoprotein level. The MAIC included 217 patients from SARAH (TARE = 94; sorafenib = 123). Median TTD in QOL was 11.23 and 8.64 months for atezolizumab-bevacizumab and TARE, respectively (HR = 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-1.50; p = 0.725). A sensitivity analysis was conducted adjusting for cause of disease defined as hepatitis B/hepatitis C/non-viral: median TTD in QOL was higher for TARE compared with atezolizumab-bevacizumab (19.88 vs 11.23 months; HR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.36-1.19; p = 0.163). Sorafenib resulted in the shortest TTD in QOL, with statistically significant differences in both base case and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: TARE using SIR-Spheres may achieve similar TTD in QOL compared with atezolizumab-bevacizumab, as the analyses found no statistically significant differences between these two interventions. Both TARE using SIR-Spheres and atezolizumab-bevacizumab seem to be more efficacious than sorafenib in maintaining QOL.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",35279814,

We aim to conduct the first network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (or their combinations) in adults with ADHD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for NMAs. We will search a broad set of electronic databases/registries and contact drug companies and experts in the field to retrieve published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel or cross-over) of medications (either licensed or unlicensed) and any non-pharmacological intervention in adults (≥18 years) with ADHD. Primary outcomes will be: (1) change in severity of ADHD core symptoms, and (2) acceptability (all-cause discontinuation). Secondary outcomes will include tolerability (drop-out due to side effects) and change in the severity of emotional dysregulation, executive dysfunctions and quality of life. The risk of bias in each individual RCT included in the NMA will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool-version 2. We will evaluate the transitivity assumption comparing the distribution of possible effect modifiers across treatment comparisons. We will perform Bayesian NMA for each outcome with random-effects model in OpenBUGS. Pooled estimates of NMA will be obtained using the Markov Chains Monte Carlo method. We will judge the credibility in the evidence derived from the NMA using the CINeMA tool (which includes assessment of publication bias). We will conduct a series of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this is the protocol for an aggregate-data level NMA, ethical approval will not be required. Results will be disseminated at national/international conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.

In practice,2213-2201 (Electronic),,,,Cai S and Xu S and Lou H and Zhang L,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35272073/,eng,,United States,"BACKGROUND: Several promising clinical trials have demonstrated the effects of type 2 biologics compared with placebos in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). However, there are no head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) between the biologics. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of different biologics used for the treatment of CRSwNP. METHODS: We systematically identified RCTs investigating the effects of biologics for CRSwNP. Primary outcomes were nasal polyp score (NPS), nasal congestion severity, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score, loss of smell severity, the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test score, and the Lund-Mackay computed tomography score. Bucher indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was used to compare the outcome parameters. RESULTS: Seven RCTs (Bachert 2017, OSTRO, POLYP 1, POLYP 2, SINUS-24, SINUS-52, and SYNAPSE) involving 1913 patients and 4 biologics (benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, and omalizumab) were included for ITC. Dupilumab presented better effects in decreasing NPS and nasal congestion severity compared with the other 3 biologics at 24 weeks of the treatment and at the end of follow-up (more than 48 weeks). Benralizumab was the least effective in reducing nasal congestion severity and SNOT-22 score at 24 weeks. No significant differences were observed between the effects of the other biologics. CONCLUSION: Our current findings suggest that dupilumab exhibits the best efficacy and safety for the treatment of CRSwNP.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",35272073,

Thus, indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) can aid treatment decision making. This study assessed the feasibility of two ITCs, a network meta-analysis (NMA) and a population-adjusted ITC (PAIC), comparing the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor niraparib in the PRIMA trial (NCT02655016) with other 1L maintenance treatments. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify trials using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to assess differences in trial design, population characteristics, treatment arms, and outcome measures. All 12 trials identified were excluded from the NMA due to the absence of a common comparator and differences in survival measures and/or inclusion criteria. The PAIC comparing PRIMA and PAOLA-1 trials was also not feasible due to differences in inclusion criteria, survival measures, and the previous receipt of chemotherapy/bevacizumab. Neither ITC met recommended guidelines for analysis; the results of such comparisons would not be considered appropriate evidence when selecting 1L maintenance options in ovarian cancer. ITCs in this setting should be performed cautiously, as many factors can preclude objective trial comparisons.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: feasibility | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""interesting to keep it in the discussion of the article""]}",35267593,PMC8909094

Population-based data can provide insights in outcomes from clinical practice. The aim of our study was to investigate disease-free and overall survival in a nationwide population aligned with the inclusion criteria of CheckMate 577. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Resected patients with stage II/III esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer (2015-2016) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients with cervical esophageal cancer, irradical resection, or complete pathological response were excluded. Disease-free and overall survival were assessed from 12 weeks after resection using Kaplan-Meier methods. In addition, to adjust for differences in characteristics between CheckMate 577 and our population-based cohort, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison was performed for pathological lymph node status and pathological tumor status. RESULTS: We identified 634 patients. Sixty percent of patients were diagnosed with recurrence or were deceased at the end of follow-up. Median disease-free survival was 19.7 months and median overall survival was 32.2 months. After the matching procedure, the median disease-free survival was 17.2 months and median overall survival was 28.2 months. CONCLUSIONS: Disease-free survival in our population-based study was considerably longer than the placebo population of CheckMate-577 (19.7 versus 11.0 months). Possible explanations are differences in characteristics, quality of esophageal cancer care, or differential strategies for evaluation of recurrence. In the Netherlands postoperative imaging is not part of the standard follow-up as opposed to the standard postoperative imaging in the CheckMate 577 trial. The difference in postoperative imaging could partially explain the longer disease-free survival observed in our study. Quality and optimization of current treatment modalities remain important aspects of esophageal cancer care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",35237351,PMC8883292

The objective was to conduct a systematic review identifying studies reporting survival in HSCT-receiving patients and apply parametric analyses to predict long-term survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five relevant studies were identified. Analyses were conducted in 10 studies (n=503; ""global"" analysis) reporting overall survival (OS) data as Kaplan-Meier curves or at patient level. Four studies (n=217; ""subgroup"" analysis) measured OS from the point of HSCT. Patient-level data were recreated from Kaplan-Meier curves and pooled, with six models tested for longer-term extrapolation. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken involving removal of data from the oldest study cohort (recruited between 1981-1997) to determine if the year which patients received HSCT impacted survival compared to post-2009 data. RESULTS: Median OS and five-year survival probability were 11.4 months and 24.4% (95% CI, 20.5-28.5%) in the global analysis, and 12.0 months and 28.4% (95% CI, 22.1-34.9%) in the subgroup analysis. The generalised gamma and Gompertz models fit longer-term extrapolation criteria. The generalised gamma model predicted survival at 10.4% vs. 14.8% (15 years), 8.3% vs. 12.8% (20 years), and 6.9% vs. 11.4% (25 years) for the global and subgroup analysis, respectively. The Gompertz model predicted survival to plateau at 23% vs. 25.6% just before 10 years. The sensitivity analysis excluding older data found median survival increased two-fold (25.3 vs. 12 months). CONCLUSIONS: Results synthesize long-term evidence of outcomes for HSCT-receiving patients, providing a basis for treatment comparison. Risk of death is low beyond four years and newer data appears correlated with improved outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_comparison",35179764,

Teprotumumab has been compared with placebo in randomized clinical trials, but not with intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP), which sometimes is used in clinical practice for this condition. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of teprotumumab vs IVMP vs placebo. DATA SOURCES: Deidentified patient-level data from teprotumumab trials and aggregate-level data from literature on the most recommended regimen of IVMP. STUDY SELECTION: PubMed and Embase were searched for randomized/observational studies using key terms and controlled vocabulary. Full texts of eligible articles were reviewed and cataloged. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Conducted by 1 reviewer (R.A.Q.) and 1 verifier (R.B.), including study characteristics, eligibility criteria, baseline characteristics, and outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in proptosis by millimeter and diplopia response (percentage with ≥1 grade reduction) from baseline to week 12 in patients receiving IVMP and placebo, and to week 24 in patients receiving teprotumumab. RESULTS: The search identified 1019 records, and 6 through manual searches, alerts, and secondary references. After excluding duplicates and screening full-text records, 12 IVMP studies were included in the matching-adjusted indirect comparison (11 for proptosis change [n = 419], 4 for diplopia response [n = 125], and 2 teprotumumab [n = 79] and placebo [n = 83] comparator studies). Treatment with IVMP resulted in a proptosis difference of -0.16 mm (95% CI, -1.55 to 1.22 mm) from baseline to week 12 vs placebo. The proptosis treatment difference between IVMP and teprotumumab of -2.31 mm (95% CI, -3.45 to -1.17 mm) favored teprotumumab. Treatment with IVMP (odds ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 0.94-7.70) was not favored over placebo in odds of diplopia response; however, teprotumumab was favored over IVMP (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.07-5.03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis suggests that use of IVMP is associated with a small, typically not clinically relevant, change from baseline in proptosis vs placebo, with modest changes in diplopia. While this nonrandomized comparison suggests that use of teprotumumab, compared with IVMP, is associated with greater improvements in proptosis and may be twice as likely to have a 1 grade or higher reduction in diplopia, randomized trials comparing these 2 treatments would be warranted to determine if 1 treatment is superior to the other to a clinically relevant degree.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: observational | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""observational""]}",35175308,PMC8855315

A lifetime partitioned survival mixture cure model, which comprises pre-progression, post-progression, and death health states, was used to estimate the accumulated costs and outcomes in terms of life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was used to reweight patient-level data from ZUMA-1, the pivotal clinical trial for axi-cel, to aggregate-level data from the pivotal tisa-cel trial, JULIET. The analysis was performed from the National Health System perspective, thus only direct costs were included. Sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed. Axi-cel yielded 2.74 incremental LYG and 2.31 additional QALY gained per patient compared to tisa-cel. Total incremental lifetime costs for axi-cel versus tisa-cel were €30,135/patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of axi-cel versus tisa-cel resulted in €10,999/LYG and the incremental cost-utility ratio in €13,049/QALY gained. SA proved robustness of the results. Considering the frequently assumed willingness-to-pay thresholds in Spain (€22,000/QALY and €60,000/QALY), axi-cel is a cost-effective treatment vs. tisa-cel for adult patients with R/R DLBCL in Spain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics,FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc",35158805,PMC8833685

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors idelalisib, copanlisib, umbralisib and (formerly) duvelisib are indicated for third-line, fourth-line, and later (3L/4L+) treatment of R/R FL. The objective of this analysis was to provide an indirect treatment comparison of tazemetostat with each PI3K inhibitor for 3L/4L+ R/R FL treatment. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify trials for idelalisib (DELTA), duvelisib (DYNAMO), copanlisib (CHRONOS-1 Part B), and umbralisib (UNITY-NHL) in 3L+ R/R FL. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were conducted by weighting tazemetostat individual patient data with available baseline characteristics from each comparator trial: age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, disease stage, histology, prior treatment lines, prior stem cell therapy, progression within 24 months, and refractory status to last therapy. Only the tazemetostat trial included patients with grade 3b or transformed FL, or recorded EZH2 mutation status. Primary safety outcomes included risk of grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); primary efficacy outcomes included objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Matched patients treated with tazemetostat had lower relative risk (RR) for all grouped safety outcomes, including any grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, compared with idelalisib (RR = 0.45), duvelisib (RR = 0.35), copanlisib (RR = 0.37), and umbralisib (RR = 0.65; all, p < 0.01), any serious TEAE, and any TEAE leading to dose reduction, drug discontinuation, or interruption. The ORR was not significantly different for tazemetostat versus other treatments (idelalisib 43% vs 56%, p = 0.16; duvelisib 48% vs 47%, p = 0.91; copanlisib 49% vs 61%, p = 0.11; and umbralisib 57% vs 47%, p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: In this statistically adjusted comparison, tazemetostat was associated with lower RR for safety outcomes versus idelalisib, duvelisib, copanlisib, and umbralisib, while achieving similar efficacy outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",35157216,

METHODS: Randomized trials of antihypertensives for nonsevere pregnancy hypertension were identified from online electronic databases, to February 28, 2021 (registration URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/; unique identifier: CRD42020188725). Our outcomes were severe hypertension, proteinuria/preeclampsia, fetal/newborn death, small-for-gestational age infants, preterm birth, and admission to neonatal care. A Bayesian random-effects model generated estimates of direct and indirect treatment comparisons. Trial sequential analysis informed future trials needed. RESULTS: Of 1246 publications identified, 72 trials were included; 61 (6923 women) were informative. All commonly prescribed antihypertensives (labetalol, other β-blockers, methyldopa, calcium channel blockers, and mixed/multi-drug therapy) versus placebo/no therapy reduced the risk of severe hypertension by 30% to 70%. Labetalol decreased proteinuria/preeclampsia (odds ratio, 0.73 [95% credible interval, 0.54-0.99]) and fetal/newborn death (odds ratio, 0.54 [0.30-0.98]) compared with placebo/no therapy, and proteinuria/preeclampsia compared with methyldopa (odds ratio, 0.66 [0.44-0.99]) and calcium channel blockers (odds ratio, 0.63 [0.41-0.96]). No other differences were identified, but credible intervals were wide. Trial sequential analysis indicated that 2500 to 10 000 women/arm (severe hypertension or safety outcomes) to >15 000/arm (fetal/newborn death) would be required to provide definitive evidence. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, all commonly prescribed antihypertensives in pregnancy reduce the risk of severe hypertension, but labetalol may also decrease proteinuria/preeclampsia and fetal/newborn death. Evidence is lacking for many other safety outcomes. Prohibitive sample sizes are required for definitive evidence. Real-world data are needed to individualize care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",35138877,PMC8823910

Access to individual patient data (IPD) can be advantageous when conducting cost-effectiveness analyses or indirect treatment comparisons. While exact times of censoring are often marked on published Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, an algorithm for reconstructing IPD from such curves that allows for their incorporation is presently unavailable. Methods. An algorithm capable of incorporating marked censoring times was developed to reconstruct IPD from KM curves, taking as additional inputs the total patient count and coordinates of the drops in survival. The reliability of the algorithm was evaluated via a simulation exercise, in which survival curves were simulated, digitized, and then reconstructed. To assess the reliability of the reconstructed curves, hazard ratios (HRs) and quantiles of survival were compared between the original and reconstructed curves, and the reconstructed curves were visually inspected. Results. No systematic differences were found in HRs and quantiles in the original versus reconstructed curves. Upon visual inspection, the reconstructed IPD provided a close fit to the digitized data from the published KM curves. Inherent to the algorithm, censoring times were incorporated into the reconstructed data exactly as specified. Conclusion. This new algorithm can reliably be used to reconstruct IPD from reported KM survival curves in the presence of extractable censoring times. Use of the algorithm will allow health researchers to reconstruct IPD more closely by incorporating censoring times exactly as marked, requiring as additional inputs the total patient count and coordinates of the drops in survival.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",35128059,PMC8808036

With the immunosuppressive effect, corticosteroids may be used to reduce the efficacy of PDL1 blockade, as well as prevent overactive immune responses, thereby reducing the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). This study quantitatively summarized the current evidence, and compared the efficacy and toxicity of therapies involving chemotherapy plus PDL1 inhibitors plus dexamethasone pretreatment (I+C+D) with chemotherapy plus PDL1 inhibitors (I+C) and therapies involving PDL1 inhibitors or chemotherapy alone (I or C). METHODS: The protocol of this study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021227281). By using a network meta-analysis approach, the different treatments were compared and ranked based on their effectiveness and rates of irAEs at the different grades. Risk rates were determined through direct meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: 12 randomized clinical trials were included with a total of 7155 NSCLC patients. Network meta-analysis generated 15 comparisons. The combination treatment of I+C+D showed a longer progression-free survival and overall survival, while I+C was less toxic, and the toxicity of I+C+D or that of I+C had been significantly decreased, compared to that of monotherapy with either drug. According to the ranking analysis, I+C+D is consistently proved to be the most effective therapeutic strategy, while I+C is linked to the lowest rate of irAEs, with the rate of grade value of ≥3 irAEs. CONCLUSION: The combination treatment of I+C+D is the most effective approach for the first-line treatment of NSCLC patients treated with I+C, I, or C.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",35106186,PMC8784760

To date, no comparative data from head-to-head clinical trials are available for these biologics. OBJECTIVE: An indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of dupilumab versus each of the anti-IL-5 and anti-IgE therapies using the endpoints of annualized severe asthma exacerbation rates and change in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). METHODS: Embase®, MEDLINE®, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for studies published between January 1, 1980 and March 25, 2019. Eligible articles included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients aged ≥ 12 years with persistent/uncontrolled asthma using at least medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β(2)-agonist with add-on biologic therapy. Bucher ITCs were performed to compare subgroups of dupilumab patients with the anti-IL-5s and anti-IgE trial populations. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs were included in the analyses. The matched dupilumab subgroups were associated with greater reductions in annualized severe exacerbation rates compared with benralizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and omalizumab (54%, 28%, 38%, and 26% greater reduction, respectively). A greater improvement in FEV(1) was also observed for dupilumab at week 12 and/or week 24/52 than for the other biologics (0.06-0.14 L).

This study was the first to investigate the impact of time point-specific NMAs of osteoporosis treatments on variability in treatments' onset of action caused by their different mechanisms of actions and trial designs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, including romosozumab (ROMO), teriparatide (TPTD), abaloparatide (ABL), alendronate (ALN), risedronate (RIS), ibandronate (IB), zoledronic acid/zoledronate (ZOL), denosumab (DEN), and raloxifene (RLX), on at least 1 fracture or bone mineral density (BMD) outcome. Of 100 RCTs identified in 5 databases, 27 RCTs were included for NMAs of new vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fracture outcomes at 12, 24, and 36 months, and 47 RCTs were included for NMAs of BMD outcomes at lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck to compare the relative efficacy of osteoporosis treatments. Quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. FINDINGS: For vertebral fractures, TPTD (83.63%), ABL (69.11%), and ROMO/ALN (78.70%) had the highest probability to be the most effective treatment at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. ROMO/ALN had the highest probability (54.4%, 64.69%, and 90.29%, respectively) to be the most effective treatment for nonvertebral fractures at 12, 24, and 36 months. For hip fractures, ROMO/ALN (46.31%), ABL (61.1%), and DEN (55.21%) had the highest probability to be the most effective treatment at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. ROMO had the highest probability (76.06%, 44.19%, and 51.78%, respectively) to be the most effective treatment for BMD outcomes at lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck.

METHODS: We conducted a pairs-comparison meta-analysis and an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis extracting published data from randomized controlled trials in literature databases from the inception of each database to Aug. 31, 2021, evaluating efficacy and safety of BTX-A intravesical instillation and BTX-A intravesical injection. We also carried out a subgroup analysis. RESULTS: We identified 24 trials in 21 studies were included in our study, of which 18 trials in 17 studies were BTX-A intravesical injections, 6 trials in 4 studies were BTX-A intravesical instillation. Compared with the normal saline injection, BTX-A intravesical injections for patients with OAB and IC/ BPS can obviously improve the symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency episode, UI and UUI, but BTX-A significantly increased the rate of urinary retention and urinary tract infection and increased PVR (p < 0.05). Adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis showed that BTX-A intravesical injections was more effective than BTX-A intravesical instillation (p > 0.05).

METHODS: Individual patient data (IPD) from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the combination versus amlodipine 5 mg (EudraCT Number: 2019-000751-13) and aggregated data (AgD) from a published RCT comparing amlodipine 10 mg versus amlodipine 5 mg were utilized in an anchored simulated treatment comparison (STC). The RCT with IPD was used to create models assessing how patients might respond to the combination if they were more comparable to those patients in the RCT with AgD. A population-adjusted indirect comparison of the treatment strategies was then conducted, using amlodipine 5 mg as an anchor. RESULTS: In the efficacy analyses, a total of 261 patients were included in the amlodipine 10 mg arm of the RCT with AgD; and a total of 178 patients in the low-dose combination arm of the RCT with IPD. Respectively, in the Amlodipine 10 mg arm and in the low-dose combination arm, the mean age was 54.3 years-old (Standard deviation [SD] 10.6), and 57.1 years-old (13.7); 8.7% and 18.8% of patients were diabetics; and the mean baseline SBP/DBP was 149.3 (12.0)/96.5 (4.7) mmHg, and 148.8 (8.2)/90.2 (7.6) mmHg.

This study indirectly compared the overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) associated with tisagenlecleucel, using data from the JULIET study (NCT02445248), versus historical treatments assessed in the CORAL study follow-up population. To assess treatment effects in the treated (full analysis set [FAS]) and enrolled (intent-to-treat [ITT]) study populations, the JULIET FAS vs. the CORAL follow-up FAS and JULIET ITT vs. CORAL follow-up ITT populations were separately compared. Propensity score weighting using standardized mortality ratio weight (SMRW) and fine stratification weight (FSW) was used to compare OS and ORR, adjusting for baseline confounders. The results indicated that tisagenlecleucel was associated with a lower hazard of death among the FAS (adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI], both FSW and SMRW: 0.44 [0.32, 0.59]) and ITT populations (FSW: 0.60 [0.44, 0.77], SMRW: 0.57 [0.44, 0.73]; all p<0.001). Median OS was 12.48 months (JULIET) vs. 4.34-4.40 months (CORAL) for the FAS, and 8.25 (JULIET) vs. 4.04-4.86 (CORAL) for the ITT populations. Tisagenlecleucel was associated with a significantly higher ORR compared to historical treatments among the FAS (adjusted response rate difference [95% CI], both FSW and SMRW: 36% [22%, 0.48%]; p<0.001) and among the ITT populations after SMRW adjustment (11% [0%, 22%]; p=0.043).

METHODS: Randomized case-control studies that compared the efficacy of various nonsurgical treatments in PC-BPPV patients at 1 week and 1 month of follow-up were comprehensively screened. Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to evaluate direct and indirect treatment comparisons. We further conducted subgroup pairwise meta-analysis to explore the inconsistency between comparisons of the Epley versus a sham maneuver and the Epley versus the Semont maneuver. RESULTS: A total of 41 parallel, randomized controlled studies were included. The Epley with vestibular rehabilitation (EVR), Epley, Semont and Hybrid maneuvers were effective in eliminating nystagmus during a Dix-Hallpike test at 1 week of follow-up (odds ratios [ORs]: 11.41-23.8, 95% credible interval [CrI]: excluding null), among which EVR showed the best efficacy (the surface area under the cumulative ranking curves [SUCRA] = 77.5%). However, at 1 month of follow-up, only the Semont (rank first, SUCRA = 76.1%) and Epley maneuvers (rank second, SUCRA = 65.3%) were effective in eliminating nystagmus during a Dix-Hallpike test. In the pairwise subgroup meta-analysis, for patients younger than 55 years of age, the efficacy of the Epley maneuver was comparable to that of the Semont maneuver [rate ratio (RR): 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.05]; for patients with a longer duration before treatment, the effect of the Epley maneuver was equivalent to that of a sham maneuver (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.90-1.29). CONCLUSION: Among the 12 types of PC-BPPV treatments, the Epley, Semont, EVR, and Hybrid maneuvers were effective in eliminating nystagmus during a Dix-Hallpike test for PC-BPPV at 1 week of follow-up, whereas only the Epley and Semont maneuvers were effective at 1 month of follow-up.

Our objective was to compare the adjusted, lifetime cost-effectiveness between nivolumab-ipilimumab, pembrolizumab-axitinib, and sunitinib for patients with mRCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3-state Markov model was developed comparing nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib to each other and sunitinib, over a 20-year lifetime horizon from a US medical center perspective. The clinical outcomes of nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib were compared using matching-adjusted indirect comparison. Costs of drug treatment, adverse events, and utilities associated with different health states and adverse events were determined using national sources and published literature. Our outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using quality-adjusted life years (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Nivolumab-ipilimumab was the most cost-effective option in the base case analysis with an ICER of $34,190/QALY compared with sunitinib, while the pembrolizumab-axitinib ICER was dominated by nivolumab-ipilimumab and was not cost-effective (ICER=$12,630,828/QALY) compared with sunitinib. The mean total costs per patient for the nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib arms were $284,683 and $457,769, respectively, compared with sunitinib at $241,656. QALY was longer for nivolumab-ipilimumab (3.23 QALY) than for adjusted pembrolizumab-axitinib (1.99 QALY), which was longer than sunitinib's (1.98 QALY). These results were most sensitive to treatment cost in both groups, but plausible changes did not alter the conclusions.

Nevertheless, the challenges associated with the use of observational data can undermine the results of the studies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using observational data for vaccine effectiveness studies by examining granular weekly effectiveness. DESIGN SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used Columbia University Medical Center data linked to State and City Immunization Registries to assess the weekly effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We conducted manual chart review of cases in week one in both groups along with a set of sensitivity analyses for Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen vaccines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used propensity score matching with up to 54,987 covariates and fitted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and constructed Kaplan-Meier plots for two main outcomes (COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization). RESULTS: The study included 179,666 patients. We observed increasing effectiveness after the first dose of mRNA vaccines with week 6 effectiveness approximating 84% (95% CI 72-91%) for COVID-19 infection and 86% (95% CI 69-95) for COVID-19-associated hospitalization. When analyzing unexpectedly high effectiveness in week one, chart review revealed that vaccinated patients are less likely to seek care after vaccination and are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 during the encounters for other conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed potential outcome misclassification for COVID-19 ICD10-CM diagnosis and the influence of excluding patients with prior COVID-19 infection and anchoring in the unexposed group. Overall vaccine effectiveness analysis in fully vaccinated patients matched the results of the randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Observational data can be used to ascertain vaccine effectiveness if potential biases are accounted for. The data need to be scrutinized to ensure that compared groups exhibit similar health seeking behavior and are equally likely to be captured in the data. Given the difference in temporal trends of vaccine exposure and baseline characteristics, indirect comparison of vaccines may produce biased results. KEY POINTS: Question: When accounted for all potential biases, what is the weekly effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines?Findings: In this cohort study we replicated the results of randomized clinical trials, discovered plausible increase in effectiveness after week one following the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and found differences in temporal trends of vaccine exposure and baseline characteristics in vaccinated groups.Meaning: Observational data can be used to reliably estimate vaccine effectiveness if the biases are accounted for.

To account for differences in respective clinical trials, a validated balancing technique was used to enable an indirect comparison of ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment efficacy in aHUS. Patient-level data from four eculizumab clinical trials were available for pooling and comparison with data from two ravulizumab trials. In the primary analysis, adult native kidney data were compared. Propensity scores were calculated from baseline characteristics (dialysis status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, platelet count, serum lactate dehydrogenase). Stabilized inverse probability weighting was used to balance groups. Changes in outcomes from baseline to 26 weeks were compared between treatment groups. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of findings. Overall, 85 patients (46 ravulizumab, 39 eculizumab) were included in the primary analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics were well balanced after weighting at baseline. At 26 weeks, clinical outcomes (including renal function, hematological markers, and dialysis prevalence), and fatigue and quality of life measures were improved with eculizumab and ravulizumab treatment. No differences between treatment groups reached statistical significance, although confidence intervals were wide. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis results were consistent with those of the primary analysis. Using appropriate methodology for indirect comparison of studies, no differences in outcomes were seen between ravulizumab and eculizumab, although, owing to small sample sizes, confidence intervals were wide. .","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34931610,

Effectiveness data for SoC, everolimus and sunitinib were obtained from published Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Given a lack of head-to-head effectiveness data, matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) were performed to population-adjust [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE survival data based on prognostic factors and derive estimates of relative effectiveness. Health state utilities were estimated from real-world evidence. Drug acquisition costs were taken from nationally published sources (BNF, NICE), and administration costs were based on treatment protocols in [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE studies, combined with nationally published unit costs (PSSRU, DoH reference costs). Incidence of adverse events were estimated using published sources. A discount rate of 3.5% was applied to both utilities and costs, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.

The objective of the current analysis was to compare the efficacy of crisaborole 2% relative to pimecrolimus 1%, tacrolimus 0.03% and tacrolimus 0.1% in patients aged ≥ 2 years with mild-to-moderate AD by comparing improvement in Investigator's Static Global Assessment scores ( (ISGA scores of 0/1 indicating ""clear or almost clear""). ISGA was selected as the primary efficacy outcome given the US Food and Drug Administration's recommendations on the use of ISGA for assessment of global severity in AD and to align with efficacy measurements in the crisaborole registration trials. Safety endpoints could not be analyzed due to differences in outcome definitions across studies. METHODS: Efficacy of crisaborole was evaluated using individual patient data (IPD) from two pivotal phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and efficacy of comparators was evaluated using published RCTs included in a previous network meta-analysis. Vehicle controls were not comparable due to differences in ingredients and population imbalance and, therefore, an unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was used, which reweighted IPD for crisaborole to estimate absolute response in comparator populations. RESULTS: The odds of achieving an improvement in ISGA score was higher with crisaborole 2% versus pimecrolimus 1% (odds ratio [OR] 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45-2.85; effective sample size =  627, reduced from 1021; p value < 0.001) and for crisaborole 2% versus tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.09-2.05; effective sample size = 311, reduced from 1021; p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: The unanchored MAIC suggests that the odds of achieving an improvement in ISGA score is greater with crisaborole 2% than with pimecrolimus 1% or tacrolimus 0.03% in patients aged ≥ 2 years with mild-to-moderate AD.

An indirect treatment comparison (network meta-analysis) was performed to determine if adjunctive cenobamate increases the odds ratio (OR) for ≥50% responder rate or for withdrawals due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to ASM discontinuation versus adjunctive therapy with other ASMs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (maintenance phase ≥ 12 weeks) assessing adjunctive ASMs in adults with uncontrolled focal seizures. Cenobamate was compared to a group of seven other ASMs, and to subgroups of branded (brivaracetam, eslicarbazepine acetate, lacosamide, and perampanel) and older (lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate) ASMs at FDA-recommended daily maintenance doses (FDA-RDMD), at all doses, and at maximum and minimum daily doses. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were eligible for analysis. The placebo-adjusted ≥ 50% responder rate for FDA-RDMD of cenobamate was superior (OR 4.200; 95% CI 2.279, 7.742) to FDA-RDMD of all seven assessed (OR 2.202 95% CI 1.915, 2.532; p = 0.044) and branded ASMs (OR 2.148; 95% CI 1.849, 2.494; p = 0.037).

In the proposed framework, patients with cancer receive at least two lines of therapy (LOTs) followed by palliative care throughout their lifetime. Patients cycle through progression-free and progressive disease health states in each LOT before death. Under this framework, four broad aspects of modeling effectiveness of treatment sequences need exploration. First, disease progression, treatment discontinuation, and the relationship between the two events should be considered. Second, the effectiveness of each LOT depends on its placement in a treatment sequence as the effectiveness of later LOTs may be influenced by the earlier LOTs. Third, the treatment-free interval (TFI; time between discontinuation of earlier LOT and initiation of later LOT) may impact a therapy's effectiveness. Fourth, in the absence of head-to-head trials directly comparing LOTs, indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of outcomes for a specific LOT or even for the entire treatment sequence is important to consider. A search of decision models that estimated effectiveness of at least two lines of oncology therapy was conducted in PubMed (N = 20) and technology appraisals by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (N = 26) to assess four methodological aspects related to the model framework: (1) selection of outcomes for effectiveness in a treatment sequence, (2) approaches to adjust the efficacy of a treatment in consideration of its place in the sequence, (3) approaches to address TFIs between LOTs, and (4) incorporation of ITCs to estimate comparators' effectiveness in the absence of direct head-to-head evidence. Most models defined health states based on disease progression on different LOTs while estimating treatment duration outside of the main model framework (30/46) and used data from multiple data sources in different LOTs to model efficacy of a treatment sequence (41/46). No models adjusted efficacy for the characteristics of patients who switched from an earlier LOT to a later LOT or adjusted for the impact of prior therapies, and just six models considered TFIs. While 11 models applied ITC results to estimate efficacy in comparator treatment sequences, the majority limited the ITC to one LOT in the sequence. Thus, there is substantial room to improve the estimation of effectiveness for treatment sequences using existing data when comparing effectiveness of alternative treatment sequences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",34841472,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative efficacy of cilta-cel vs physician's choice of treatment, as no head-to-head trials have been conducted. METHODS: An external control arm for CARTITUDE-1 was created from patients in the long-term follow-up for three clinical trials of daratumumab (POLLUX, CASTOR, and EQUULEUS) who satisfied the eligibility criteria of CARTITUDE-1. These patients received physician's choice of treatment following the discontinuation of study drugs. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to align the external control and CARTITUDE-1 populations on important baseline characteristics. Overall response rate, complete response or better rate, progression-free survival, time to next treatment, and overall survival were assessed. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: After propensity score weighting, baseline characteristics were comparable between cohorts. Patients showed improved results with cilta-cel vs physician's choice of treatment: overall response rate (relative risk: 2.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.27, 3.84; p < 0.0001]), complete response or better (relative risk: 111.70 [95% CI 29.08, 429.06; p < 0.0001]), progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.24 [95% CI 0.15, 0.37; p < 0.0001]), time to next treatment (HR: 0.14 [95% CI 0.09, 0.22; p < 0.0001]), and overall survival (HR: 0.21 [95% CI 0.13, 0.35; p < 0.0001]).

In the absence of head-to-head studies, the present study sought to indirectly compare the efficacy and tolerability between these two treatments. METHODS: This anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) used patient-level data from the phase 3, randomized, controlled SPARTAN study (apalutamide + ADT), weighted to match aggregate published data from the ARAMIS study (darolutamide + ADT) for clinically relevant baseline measures. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI) were estimated for efficacy endpoints: metastasis-free survival (MFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Odds ratios were estimated for tolerability outcomes: adverse events and serious adverse events. RESULTS: Before weighting, baseline characteristics from SPARTAN versus ARAMIS were different for median PSA (7.8 vs. 9.2 ng/mL), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 (23% vs. 31%), use of bone-targeted agents (10% vs. 4%), median time from initial diagnosis (94.9 vs. 85.4 months), and proportion of patients from North America (35% vs. 12%) and Europe (50% vs. 64%). After matching (n = 455), our analysis demonstrated that apalutamide + ADT had a Bayesian probability of being more effective than darolutamide + ADT for MFS [98.3%; HR 0.70 (95% CrI 0.51, 0.98)], PSA progression [~ 100%; HR 0.46 (95% CrI 0.33, 0.64)], and PFS [93.2%; HR 0.79 (95% CrI 0.59, 1.08)]. Results for OS and tolerability were similar between apalutamide + ADT and darolutamide + ADT. CONCLUSION: This anchored MAIC analysis of pivotal phase 3 studies in patients with nmCRPC suggests that apalutamide + ADT is more effective than darolutamide + ADT for MFS, progression-free survival (PFS), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, with a similar OS benefit and tolerability profile.

METHODS: A cost-consequence analysis of the cost and clinical response of two treatment strategies was conducted over a 2-year time horizon. A hypothetical cohort of 10 patients with PsA initiated treatment with secukinumab 150mg (cohort A) or adalimumab 40mg (cohort B), respectively. Patients achieving clinical response (ACR20/50/70) at week 24 continued the initial treatment, while patients with inadequate response switched to secukinumab 300mg. Pharmacological costs were calculated based on SmPC (notified ex-factory price). The lowest cost of adalimumab biosimilar was considered. Data on clinical response were extracted from the two matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) published comparing secukinumab vs adalimumab. Results were expressed as the cost difference between the two cohorts (€, 2019) and were calculated for each clinical response criteria (ACR20/50/70) and for each MAIC. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact of potential discounts on the cost of adalimumab while maintaining the cost of secukinumab unchanged. RESULTS: Depending on the MAIC used, the cost of initiating biologic treatment for PsA with secukinumab 150mg was 18-33% lower than the one estimated for adalimumab 40mg, for ACR20, 18-28% for ACR50, and 16-23% for ACR70 response rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that it would be necessary a discount of 40-60%, 40-65% and 50-75% over the adalimumab cost to compensate for the differences in efficacy observed for ACR20/50/70, respectively, depending on the MAIC used. CONCLUSION: In patients with PsA, secukinumab could be considered a more efficient first-line biologic treatment compared to adalimumab, from the SNHS perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc",34756316,

We used an MAIC to compare first-line patients from MONALEESA-3 and PALOMA-1. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An unanchored MAIC of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in first-line patients with HR+/HER2- ABC treated with RIB+FUL versus PAL+LET was conducted using individual patient data from MONALEESA-3 and aggregated data from PALOMA-1. To match patients in PALOMA-1, patients in MONALEESA-3 were limited to those with no prior endocrine therapy for ABC and no (neo) adjuvant LET ≤12 months before enrollment. PFS and OS were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 329 and 178 patients from RIB+FUL and PBO+FUL arms, respectively, of MONALEESA-3 were matched to 84 and 81 patients from PAL+LET and LET arms of PALOMA-1.

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to address the lack of head-to-head comparisons and the uncertainty of the benefit from immunotherapy-based combinations in all the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) subgroups. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A systematic review and a network meta-analysis were performed. Overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population was the primary endpoint. OS according to IMDC subgroups (favorable, intermediate, poor), PD-L1 expression, and grade ⩾3 adverse events (AEs) were secondary endpoints. A SUCRA analysis was performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Six randomized phase III trials with 5121 patients were included. There was a high likelihood (82%) that nivolumab-cabozantinib was the preferred treatment in OS. The benefit of ICI-based combinations over sunitinib was unclear in the favorable-risk subgroup. Nivolumab-ipilimumab had the best risk/benefit ratio among all the ICI-based combinations. The limitations were the lack of individual patient data; the heterogeneity of patients' characteristics, trial designs, and follow-up times; and a limited number of studies for indirect comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: A customized approach for the first-line treatment of patients with mRCC should consider the risk/benefit profile of each treatment option, especially considering the likeliness of long-term survival finally reached in this setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34733356,PMC8558789

However, a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis between these FRCs from a UK Health Service perspective has not been conducted. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes Model was used to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes in patients with T2DM receiving iGlarLixi (based on the LixiLan-G trial) versus iDegLira (based on relative treatment effects from an indirect treatment comparison using data from DUAL III). Utilities, medical costs, and costs of diabetes-related complications were derived from literature. Model outputs included costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated with a local willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Extensive scenario, one-way sensitivity, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model. RESULTS: iGlarLixi was less costly (iGlarLixi, £30,011; iDegLira, £40,742), owing to lower acquisition costs, and similar in terms of QALYs gained (iGlarLixi, 8.437; iDegLira, 8.422). Extensive scenario and sensitivity analyses supported the base case findings. CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control despite GLP-1 RAs, use of iGlarLixi was associated with substantial cost savings and comparable utility outcomes. iGlarLixi can be considered as cost-effective versus iDegLira from the UK Health Service perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics,FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34714524,PMC8586382

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre, was commissioned to act as the independent evidence review group (ERG). This paper summarises the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's critical review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, highlights the key methodological considerations and describes the development of the NICE guidance by the Appraisal Committee. Based on a systematic literature review, one randomised controlled trial, MAVORIC, was identified showing favourable results in patients with MF and SS. However, MAVORIC compared mogamulizumab to vorinostat, which is not standard care in the NHS, and there is uncertainty due to the study design, specifically crossover of patients. Based on a ""naïve comparison of results from the vorinostat arm of the MAVORIC study and the physician's choice arm (methotrexate or bexarotene i.e. United Kingdom [UK] standard treatments) of the ALCANZA study as well as comparison to Phase II bexarotene data"", the company considered vorinostat to be ""a reasonable proxy for current standard of care in the NHS"". The ERG considered, based on the limited data available, that the comparability of vorinostat (MAVORIC) and physician's choice (ALCANZA) could not be established. In response to the Appraisal Consultation Document, the company provided an unanchored matched adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of mogamulizumab with UK standard care by analysing Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. However, given the high risk of bias of an unanchored MAIC, these results needed to be regarded with a considerable degree of caution. The economic analysis suffered from uncertainty because there was no trial evidence on the comparator in the England and Wales National Health Service (NHS), and it was unclear to what extent the trial (MAVORIC) comparator (vorinostat) was comparable to standard care, referred to as established clinical management (ECM) in the NHS. The evidence for overall survival had not reached maturity and was confounded by treatment switching, for which different crossover adjustment methods produced large variations in life years. Caregiver utilities were applied in the analysis, but there was a lack of guidance on their application and whether these were indicated in this appraisal. After consultation, the company updated the economic analysis with the MAIC. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing mogamulizumab against ECM were (depending on whether the HES or MAVORIC comparison were used) £31,030 or £32,634 per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained according to the company's base case and £38,274 or £80,555 per QALY gained according to the ERG's base case. NICE did not recommend mogamulizumab for treating MF or SS in adults who have had at least one previous systemic treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_original_article",34664200,

In the absence of head-to-head evidence, an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of adjuvant nivolumab versus placebo, the proxy for a watch-and-wait strategy, was conducted in patients with high-risk resected melanoma. METHODS: An ITC using the Bucher method compared nivolumab with placebo using intention-to-treat population data from the phase III CheckMate 238 (nivolumab vs ipilimumab; minimum follow-up, 4 years; NCT02388906) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18071 (ipilimumab vs placebo; minimum follow-up, ≈4.5 years; NCT00636168) trials. The end-points were recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS). To account for cross-trial differences in staging and subsequent therapy, additional analyses examined patients with stage IIIB/IIIC disease and adjusted post-recurrence survival in EORTC 18071, respectively. RESULTS: Nivolumab versus placebo was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.68) and OS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.89).

Based on empirical consensus, current guidance recommends a ""1-3-6-12 days"" rule to resume OACs after AIS. This study investigated the suitability of guideline-recommended timing for OAC initiation. METHODS:  Using data of 12,307 AF patients hospitalized for AIS, for the period 2012 to 2016, in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we constructed a sequence of cohorts of OAC users and propensity score-matched nonusers, creating one cohort on each day of OAC initiation for 30 days since admission. Composite outcome included effectiveness (cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, and venous thromboembolism) and safety (intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematuria) outcomes. Comparing with nonusers, we examined the risks in the early OAC use (within 1-3-6-12 days) or guideline-recommended delayed use. Indirect comparison between the early and delayed use was conducted using mixed treatment comparison. RESULTS:  Across the AIS severity, the risks of composite or effectiveness outcome were lower in OAC users than nonusers, and the risks were similar between the early and delayed use groups. In patients with severe AIS, early OAC use was associated with an increased risk of safety outcome, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.67 (confidence interval [CI]: 1·30-2·13) compared with nonusers and a HR of 1.44 (CI: 0·99-2·09) compared with the delayed use. CONCLUSION:  Our study findings support an early OAC initiation in AF patients with mild-to-moderate AIS and a routine delayed use of OACs can be considered in those with severe AIS to avoid a serious bleeding event.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34649296,

METHODS: We performed an updated search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE through 23 August 2021 to identify RCTs of adult patients with chronic CAD and/or PAD that compared combination anticoagulant or P2Y12 inhibitor with low-dose aspirin to low-dose aspirin alone. Outcomes of interest included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) including cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI) and bleeding. When needed, outcomes were pooled using random-effects models to generate hazard or risk ratios (HRs or RRs) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Adjusted ITCs using subsequent pooled HRs/RRs were then performed. RESULTS: Six publications reporting the results of two unique RCTs (one evaluating clopidogrel + aspirin vs. aspirin alone and the other rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily + aspirin vs. aspirin alone) were analyzed. The ITC suggested that rivaroxaban + aspirin was associated with a lower risk of MACEs compared with clopidogrel + aspirin (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68-0.98). When looking at the individual components of MACE, rivaroxaban + aspirin was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular death (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.57-0.98) and stroke (RR = 0.67, 95 CI = 0.49-0.93) and similar risk of MI (RR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.70-1.23) versus clopidogrel + aspirin. No evidence of a difference in moderate-to-severe bleeding, fatal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was seen between the two treatment strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to clopidogrel + low-dose aspirin, the use of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily + low-dose aspirin reduced the risk of MACE, CV death and stroke including ischemic stroke in patients with or at high risk for chronic CAD and/or PAD. These benefits of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily + low-dose aspirin compared to clopidogrel + low-dose aspirin appear to be achieved without significantly increasing patients' risk of moderate-to-severe bleeding, including ICH or fatal bleeding.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34641745,

METHODS: An unanchored PA-ITC was performed on investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) data. Individual patient data from SOLO1 (olaparib versus placebo) and from BRCA-mutated patients in PAOLA-1/ENGOT-ov25 (olaparib plus bevacizumab versus placebo plus bevacizumab) were pooled. Each arm of PAOLA-1 was weighted so that key baseline patient characteristics were similar to the SOLO1 cohort. Analyses were performed in patients with complete baseline data. Weighted Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the comparative efficacy of different maintenance therapy strategies, supplemented by weighted Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: Data from SOLO1 patients (olaparib, n = 254; placebo, n = 126) were compared with data from BRCA-mutated PAOLA-1 patients (olaparib plus bevacizumab, n = 151; placebo plus bevacizumab, n = 71).

Patient-level data from two pivotal trials, ELIANA (tisagenlecleucel; n = 79) and MT103-205 (blinatumomab; n = 70), were used in comparisons of CR and OS, controlling for cross-trial difference in available patient characteristics. Five different adjustment approaches were implemented: stabilized inverse probability of treatment weight (sIPTW); trimmed sIPTW; stratification by propensity score quintiles; adjustment for prognostic factors; and adjustment for both prognostic factors and propensity score. Comparative analyses indicate that treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated with a statistically significant higher likelihood of achieving CR and lower hazard of death than treatment with blinatumomab. The tisagenlecleucel group exhibited a higher likelihood of CR than the blinatumomab group in every analysis regardless of adjustment approach (odds ratios: 6.71-9.76). Tisagenlecleucel was also associated with a lower hazard of death than blinatumomab in every analysis, ranging from 68% to 74% lower hazard of death than with blinatumomab, determined using multiple adjustment approaches (hazard ratios: 0.26-0.32). These findings support the growing body of clinical trials and real-world evidence demonstrating that tisagenlecleucel is an important treatment option for children and young adults with R/R ALL.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34597381,

We conducted this indirect comparison to compare the efficacy of and safety between these two treatments for providing reference for decision making. METHODS: Relevant databases were searched for eligible trials. A well-accepted adjusted indirect treatment comparison (ITC) approach was selected to pool efficacy results and safety outcomes. Subgroup analyses were stratified according to PD-L1 expression and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Four eligible randomized trials (CheckMate9LA, KEYNOTE-021G, KEYNOTE 189, KEYNOTE 407) involving 2017 patients were available to analyze. The ITC results suggested that N-I + chemo is comparable to Pem + chemo in OS (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82-1.30) and ORR (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62-1.06), but tended to yield inferior PFS (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.59) than did Pem + chemo. As for safety profiles, N-I + chemo showed no significant difference relative to Pem + chemo in any grade adverse events: (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.10), but demonstrated reduced toxicity in chemo-related adverse events, such as anemia (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81), neutropenia (RR0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.79), and thrombocytopenia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21-0.69). CONCLUSIONS: N-I + chemo is a promising treatment option for providing comparable OS related to Pem + chemo. However, for never smoker female patients, Pem + chemo is preferable to choose for demonstrating favorable OS benefit than N-I + chemo.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34589422,PMC8473819

METHODS: At the time of this study, STORM Part 2, NCT02336815 (selinexor plus low-dose dexamethasone; sel + dex) was systematically identified as the only feasible comparator to the DREAMM-2 cohort. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC) evaluated efficacy and safety of belamaf (2.5 mg/kg; n = 97) versus sel + dex (80 mg + 20 mg, respectively; n = 123). Populations were weighted for clinically validated effect modifiers and prognostic factors. Outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), overall response rate (ORR), time to response (TTR), and safety. The relative efficacy of belamaf versus standard of care (SoC) on OS was estimated by a Bucher indirect treatment comparison using the MAIC-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for OS of belamaf (DREAMM-2) versus sel + dex (STORM Part 2) and a HR adjusted for refractoriness to carfilzomib and high-risk cytogenetics of sel + dex (STORM) versus SoC (MAMMOTH). RESULTS: Belamaf demonstrated improved OS (HR 0.53; 95% confidence interval 0.34, 0.83; p = 0.005) and DoR (0.41; 0.21, 0.83; p = 0.013) versus sel + dex. There were no statistically significant differences in ORR, TTR, and PFS. Belamaf had a favorable safety profile for most evaluable hematologic (any-grade, Grade 3-4) and non-hematologic (any-grade) adverse events versus sel + dex. Significantly improved OS was observed with belamaf versus SoC (0.29; 0.16, 0.54; p < 0.001).

NMAs help researchers study important and previously unanswerable questions, which have contributed to a rapid rise in the number of NMA publications in the biomedical literature. However, the conduct and interpretation of NMAs are more complex than pairwise meta-analyses: there are additional NMA model assumptions (i.e., network connectivity, homogeneity, transitivity, and consistency) and outputs (e.g., network plots and surface under the cumulative ranking curves [SUCRAs]).

We assessed the comparative efficacy of different strategies for difficult biliary cannulation through a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: We identified 17 randomized controlled trials (2015 patients) that compared the efficacy of different adjunctive methods for difficult biliary cannulation (needle-knife techniques, pancreatic guidewire-assisted technique, pancreatic-assisted technique, and transpancreatic sphincterotomy) either with each other or with persistence with the standard cannulation techniques. The success rate of biliary cannulation and the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) were the outcomes of interest. We performed pairwise and network meta-analysis for all treatments and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria to appraise quality of evidence. RESULTS: Low-quality evidence supported the use of transpancreatic sphincterotomy over persistence with standard cannulation techniques (risk ratio [RR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.59) and over any other adjunctive intervention (RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.01-1.44] vs pancreatic guidewire-assisted technique, RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.01-1.43] vs early needle-knife techniques, RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.03-2.10] vs pancreatic stent-assisted technique) for increasing the success rate of biliary cannulation. No other significant results were observed in any other comparisons. Based on the network model, transpancreatic sphincterotomy (P-score, .97) followed by early needle-knife techniques (P-score, .62) were ranked highest in terms of increasing the success rate of biliary cannulation. Early needle-knife techniques outperformed persistence with standard cannulation techniques in terms of decreasing PEP rate (RR, .61; 95% CI, .37-1.00), whereas both early needle-knife techniques and transpancreatic sphincterotomy led to lower PEP rates as compared with pancreatic guidewire-assisted technique (RR, .49 [95% CI, .23-.99] and .53 [95% CI, .30-.92], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Transpancreatic sphincterotomy increases the success rate of biliary cannulation as compared with persistence with the standard cannulation techniques. Early needle-knife techniques and transpancreatic sphincterotomy are superior to other interventions in decreasing PEP rates and should be considered in patients with difficult cannulation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34543649,

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for articles related to phase 3, double-blind, controlled trials of vibegron 75 mg and mirabegron 25/50 mg in patients with OAB. Efficacy outcomes included change from baseline at weeks 4, 12, and 52 in mean daily number of total urinary incontinence episodes and micturitions and mean volume voided/micturition. Effect size was computed as placebo-subtracted change from baseline (weeks 4, 12) or active control (tolterodine)-subtracted change from baseline (week 52) for each treatment group. Adverse events (AEs) are presented descriptively. RESULTS: After removal of duplicates, 49 records were identified, and after screening 9 met inclusion criteria for analysis. Vibegron showed significantly greater reduction in mean daily number of total incontinence episodes than mirabegron 25 mg at week 4, mirabegron 50 mg (weeks 4, 52), and tolterodine (weeks 4, 12) (P < 0.05, each) and significantly greater improvement in volume voided versus mirabegron 25 mg (week 12), mirabegron 50 mg (weeks 12, 52), and tolterodine (week 4) (P < 0.05, each). Confidence intervals of point estimates overlapped zero for all other comparisons of vibegron and mirabegron (25 or 50 mg) or tolterodine, indicating no significant differences between treatments for these time/endpoints. Urinary tract infection, hypertension, and dry mouth were the most commonly occurring AEs for vibegron, mirabegron, and tolterodine, respectively, in the short-term trials; hypertension was the most commonly occurring AE with all three treatments in the long-term trials. CONCLUSIONS: Vibegron was associated with significant improvement in total incontinence episodes versus mirabegron at 4 and 52 weeks and volume voided at 12 and 52 weeks. Improvement in micturitions was similar between vibegron and mirabegron or tolterodine.

METHODS: Primary data sources included individual patient data from the TRANSCEND NHL 001 study (TRANSCEND [NCT02631044]; N = 256 for efficacy set, N = 269 for safety set) for liso-cel and summary-level data from the ZUMA-1 study (NCT02348216; N = 101 for efficacy set, N = 108 for safety set) for axi-cel. Inter-study differences in design, eligibility criteria, baseline characteristics, and outcomes were assessed and aligned to the extent feasible. Clinically relevant prognostic factors were adjusted in a stepwise fashion by ranked order. Since bridging therapy was allowed in TRANSCEND but not ZUMA-1, the initial efficacy and safety analyses included bridging therapy use as a matching factor (TRANSCEND patients who received bridging therapy were removed). Subsequent sensitivity analyses excluded this matching factor. RESULTS: The initial analysis showed similar MAIC-weighted efficacy outcomes between TRANSCEND and ZUMA-1 for overall and complete response rates (odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.40 [0.56-3.49] and 1.21 [0.56-2.64], respectively) and for overall survival and progression-free survival (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.81 [0.44-1.49] and 0.95 [0.58-1.57], respectively). MAIC-weighted safety outcomes favored liso-cel, with significantly lower odds of all-grade and grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome (odds ratio [95% CI], 0.03 [0.01-0.07] and 0.08 [0.01-0.67], respectively) and study-specific neurological events (0.16 [0.08-0.33] and 0.05 [0.02-0.15], respectively). Efficacy and safety outcomes remained similar in sensitivity analyses, which did not include use of bridging therapy as a matching factor.

The treatment outcomes of comparing different MAbs in combination with the above-mentioned agents remained unclear. We performed the meta-analysis to indirectly compare the effect and safety of MAbs targeting CD38, SLAMF7, and PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with bortezomib/immunomodulators plus dexamethasone/prednisone for patients with MM. METHODS: We searched thoroughly in the databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which at least one of the three MAbs were included. We included eleven eligible RCTs with 5367 patients in the meta-analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out using StataMP14 and Indirect Treatment Comparisons software. RESULTS: We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and relative risk (RR) for overall response rate, complete response (CR) or better, very good partial response (VGPR) or better, VGPR, partial response, stable disease, and grade 3 or higher adverse events among the three groups. The HRs for PFS of the CD38 group vs SLAMF7 group, CD38 group vs PD-1/PD-L1 group, and SLAMF7 group vs PD-1/PD-L1 group were 0.662 (95%CI 0.543-0.806), 0.317 (95%CI 0.221-0.454), and 0.479 (95%CI 0.328-0.699), respectively. The HR for OS of the CD38 group vs SLAMF7 group was 0.812 (95%CI 0.584-1.127). The RR for CR or better in the CD38 group vs SLAMF7 group was 2.253 (95%CI 1.284-3.955). The RR for neutropenia of the CD38 group vs SLAMF7 group was 1.818 (95%CI 1.41-2.344). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the CD38 group had longer PFS and better treatment response than that with the SLAMF7 or PD-1/PD-L1 group. In addition, the SLAMF7 group prolonged PFS compared with the PD-1/PD-L1 group and was associated with a lower incidence of grade 3 or higher neutropenia than the CD38 and PD-1/PD-L1 group. In conclusion, MAbs targeting CD38 are the best, followed by those targeting SLAMF7; MAbs targeting PD-1/PD-L1 are the worst when in combination with bortezomib/immunomodulators plus dexamethasone/prednisone for the treatment of MM.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34488679,PMC8419924

Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) is the standard treatment for people with NMIBC, but the high rate of cancer recurrence after first TURBT is a challenge that physicians and patients face. Tumours seen during follow-up may have been missed or incompletely resected during first TURBT. TURBT is conventionally performed using white light to see the tumours. However, small papillary or flat tumours may be missed with the use of white light alone. With the emergence of new technologies to improve visualization during TURBT, better diagnostic and patient outcomes may be expected. We conducted a health technology assessment of two enhanced visualization methods, both as an adjunct to white light to guide first TURBT for people with suspected NMIBC-hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL), a solution that is instilled into the bladder to make tumours fluoresce under blue-violet light, and narrow band imaging (NBI), a technology that filters light into wavelengths that can be absorbed by hemoglobin in the tumours, making them appear darker. Our assessment included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, and the budget impact of publicly funding these new technologies to improve patient outcomes following first TURBT. The use of NBI in diagnostic cystoscopy was out of scope for this health technology assessment. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence from inception to April 15, 2020. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the outcomes of first TURBT with the use of HAL or NBI, both as an adjunct to white light, with the outcomes of first TURBT using white light alone, or studies that made such comparison between HAL and NBI. We conducted pairwise meta-analyses using a fixed effects model where head-to-head comparisons were available. In the absence of any published RCT for comparison between HAL and NBI, we indirectly compared the two technologies through indirect treatment comparison (ITC) analysis. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search and conducted a cost-utility analysis with a 15-year time horizon from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding HAL and NBI as an adjunct to white light in people undergoing their first TURBT for suspected non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in Ontario. RESULTS: In the clinical evidence review, we identified 8 RCTs that used HAL or NBI as an adjunct to white light during first TURBT. Pairwise meta-analysis of HAL studies showed that HAL-guided TURBT as an adjunct to white light significantly reduces recurrence rate at 12 months compared with TURBT using white light alone (risk ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.95) (GRADE: Moderate). Five-year recurrence-free survival was significantly higher when HAL was used as an adjunct to white light than when white light was used alone (GRADE: Moderate). There was little to no difference in the tumour progression rate (GRADE: Moderate).Meta-analysis of NBI studies did not show a significant difference between NBI-guided TURBT as an adjunct to white light and TURBT using white light alone in reducing the rate of recurrence at 12 months (risk ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.75-1.19) (GRADE: Moderate). No evidence on the effect on recurrence-free survival or tumour progression rate was identified for NBI-guided TURBT. The indirect estimate from the network analysis showed a trend toward a lower rate of recurrence after HAL-guided TURBT than after NBI-guided TURBT but the difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.11) (GRADE: Low). Studies showed that use of HAL or NBI during TURBT was generally safe.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of HAL-guided TURBT compared with NBI-guided TURBT, both as an adjunct to white light, is $12,618 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared with TURBT using white light alone and using adjunct NBI, the probability of HAL-guided TURBT being cost-effective is 69.1% at a willingness-to-pay value of $50,000 per QALY gained and 74.6% at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY gained. The annual budget impact of publicly funding HAL-guided TURBT in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from an additional $0.6 million in year 1 to $2.5 million in year 5. CONCLUSIONS: First TURBT guided by HAL as an adjunct to white light likely reduces the rate of recurrence at 12 months and increases 5-year recurrence-free survival when compared with first TURBT using white light alone. There is likely little to no difference in the tumour progression rate. First TURBT guided by NBI as an adjunct to white light likely results in little to no difference in the rate of recurrence at 12 months when compared with first TURBT using white light alone. Based on an indirect comparison, there may be little to no difference in cancer recurrence rate between HAL-guided and NBI-guided first TURBT. Use of HAL or NBI during first TURBT is generally safe. For people undergoing their first TURBT for suspected non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, using HAL as an adjunct to white light is likely to be cost-effective compared with using white light alone or with using NBI as an adjunct to white light. We estimate that publicly funding HAL as an adjunct to white light to guide first TURBT for people in Ontario with suspected NMIBC would result in additional costs of between $0.6 million and $2.5 million per year over the next 5 years.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34484486,PMC8382283

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of belantamab mafodotin (belamaf; DREAMM-2; NCT03525678) was compared with selinexor plus dexamethasone (SEL+DEX; STORM Part 2; NCT02336815) among patients with RRMM who have received at least four prior therapies. The base case used a US commercial payer's perspective over a 10-year time horizon. Efficacy data were based on parametric survival analysis of DREAMM-2 and matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison between DREAMM-2 and STORM Part 2, which assessed relative treatment effects between belamaf and SEL+DEX. Cost inputs included drug treatment, concomitant medications, adverse event management, subsequent treatments, and disease management. RESULTS: Belamaf decreased total treatment costs per patient by $14,267 and increased patient life years by 0.74 and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.49 versus SEL+DEX. Patients receiving belamaf accrued 0.12 fewer progression-free life years versus patients on SEL+DEX. CONCLUSIONS: From a US commercial payer's perspective, belamaf had lower costs, and increased QALYs and life-year gain, compared with SEL+DEX. Belamaf is therefore likely to be a cost-effective treatment option for patients with RRMM who have received four or more prior lines of therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics,FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc",34465265,

METHODS: Individual patient data from the PEGASUS study (NCT03500549) comparing pegcetacoplan and eculizumab enabled adjustment for baseline differences compared with published results from the ALXN1210-PNH-302 study (NCT03056040), comparing ravulizumab and eculizumab. Adjusted differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed via weighted Wald tests for comparisons of pegcetacoplan vs. ravulizumab, anchored to the common comparator eculizumab. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients from PEGASUS (36 pegcetacoplan; 32 eculizumab) and 195 from ALXN1210-PNH-302 (97 ravulizumab; 98 eculizumab) were included. Compared with ravulizumab, treatment with pegcetacoplan was associated with more transfusion avoidance (adjusted difference [95% CI] = +71.4% [53.5%, 89.3%]), hemoglobin level stabilization (+75.5% [56.4%, 94.6%]), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level normalization (+64.0% [41.8%, 86.1%]), and fewer blood transfusions (-5.7 units [-7.2, -4.2]). Additionally, patients who received pegcetacoplan experienced clinically meaningful improvements in fatigue (+8.2 points [3.8, 12.6]), global health status (+9.6 points [0.1, 19.0]), physical functioning (+11.5 points [3.6, 19.5]), and fatigue symptoms (-13.3 points [-23.7, -3.0]), compared with ravulizumab. Mean change from baseline in LDH level was not significantly different for pegcetacoplan vs. ravulizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that among patients previously treated with eculizumab, clinical, hematological, and quality of life endpoints were better for patients who received the C3 complement inhibitor pegcetacoplan vs. patients who received ravulizumab, a C5 complement inhibitor.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",34445916,

An indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis was performed to compare efficacy and safety of medications (solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil) approved to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea. METHODS: Efficacy and safety measures assessed in this indirect treatment comparison included Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), 20-minute Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT20), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (any, serious, or leading to discontinuation). RESULTS: A systematic literature review identified 6 parallel-arm, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials that randomized 1,714 total participants to placebo, solriamfetol, modafinil, or armodafinil. In this indirect treatment comparison, all comparators were associated with greater improvements than placebo on the ESS, MWT20, and CGI-C after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Relative to comparators and placebo at 12 weeks, solriamfetol at 150 mg or 300 mg had the highest probabilities of improvement in the ESS, MWT20, and CGI-C. Modafinil (200 or 400 mg) and solriamfetol (150 or 300 mg) were associated with greater improvement on the FOSQ than placebo at 12 weeks. Less than 2% of patients using placebo or comparators experienced serious or discontinuation-related treatment-emergent adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this indirect treatment comparison show 12 weeks of treatment with solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil resulted in varying levels of improvement on the ESS, MWT20, and CGI-C and similar safety risks in participants with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. Outcomes from eligible RCTs were compared by an indirect treatment comparison using a Bayesian framework. Subanalyses of Japanese and international trials were performed. RESULTS: Eight RCTs (duration 26-30 weeks) were included. Mean difference in HbA1c change with iGlarLixi exceeded that for IDegAsp: -0.64 (95% credible interval -1.01, -0.28) %-units (-7.0 [-11.0, -3.1] mmol/mol) for all trials, -0.39 (-0.55, -0.23) %-units (-4.3 [-6.0, -2.5] mmol/mol) for international, and -0.88 (-1.11, -0.64) %-units (-9.6 [-12.1, -7.0] mmol/mol) for Japanese trials. HbA1c target achievement (<7.0%-units [<53 mmol/mol]) was greater for iGlarLixi in all trials (odds ratio 2.50 [1.06, 5.56]) and Japanese trials (2.17 [1.27, 3.70]), but not in international trials (2.17 [0.42, 11.11]). Analyses suggesting differences in mean postmeal self-measured plasma glucose were significantly lower by 1.0-2.0 mmol/L (18-36 mg/dL) with iGlarLixi in all analyses. Bodyweight change was more favourable (1-2 kg) for iGlarLixi versus IDegAsp for all analyses (P < 0.05). Comparisons of hypoglycaemia were inconclusive owing to differences in definitions between studies. Adverse events were more frequent with iGlarLixi because of gastrointestinal intolerance.

Instead, the comparative efficacy of siponimod can be derived from indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs). We assessed the suitability of ITCs leveraging individual patient data from relevant phase III trials across different MS phenotypes. METHODS: One siponimod trial in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), four fingolimod trials (three in relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS], and one in primary progressive MS [PPMS]), and two ofatumumab trials in relapsing MS (RMS) were considered. The suitability of ITCs was evaluated based on trial design, patient eligibility criteria, baseline patient characteristics, placebo response, and outcome definitions for each trial. Analyses deemed feasible were conducted using one-to-one propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: An ITC between siponimod in SPMS and either fingolimod in RRMS or ofatumumab in RMS was not feasible because of insufficient overlap in key patient characteristics (e.g. disability level and relapse history) and differences in placebo response. However, a comparison between siponimod in SPMS and fingolimod in PPMS was feasible because of sufficient overlap in eligibility criteria and baseline characteristics. One-to-one PSM demonstrated siponimod was favored relative to fingolimod for time to 6- and 3-month confirmed disability progression though not significantly different (hazard ratio 0.76 [95% confidence interval 0.48-1.20; p-value = .240] and hazard ratio 0.80 [95% confidence interval 0.52-1.22; p-value = .300], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: For trials in MS, clinical phenotype is an important determinant of ITC feasibility. An ITC between siponimod in SPMS and either fingolimod in RRMS or ofatumumab in RMS was not feasible. The only feasible comparison was between siponimod in SPMS and fingolimod in PPMS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34384311,

It can considerably impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL) beyond the impairments due to other psoriasis symptoms, for example, because patients feel ashamed of visible nail defects or because of the functional impairment in manual activities and walking. In clinical trials on nail psoriasis, it is therefore crucial to assess whether the treatment reduces HRQoL impairments that are specific to nail psoriasis. For this purpose, two validated patient questionnaires are available, the Nail Psoriasis Quality of Life Scale (NPQ10) and the Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis-Quality of Life (NAPPA-QOL). The ten-item NPQ10 has the advantage of being short and thus quick to administer. The 20-item NAPPA-QOL, in contrast, assesses the different dimensions of HRQoL which is considered a multi-dimensional construct. Yet most randomized controlled trials on nail psoriasis do not evaluate HRQoL improvement. If they do, a number of different instruments are used, most of which are not nail specific. This makes comparison of trial outcomes difficult. Harmonizing the measurement of HRQoL in future clinical trials on nail psoriasis would improve comparability across studies and would also enhance the reliability of meta-analyses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",34383273,PMC8566428

This study aims to assess the effects of assessment-schedule matching (ASM) on the relative effectiveness on the PFS of avelumab versus approved comparator immunotherapies or chemotherapy after population matching in the second-line (2L) setting for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. METHODS: The MAIC used patient-level data for avelumab from the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial (NCT01772004). PFS was compared with published curves for other treatments to obtain population-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). The MAIC was repeated after conducting ASM for differences in tumor assessment scheduled first at 6 weeks for avelumab and durvalumab and at 8 or 9 weeks for other treatments. RESULTS: MAIC adjustment alone altered the HR estimates up to 23%, whereas MAIC plus ASM resulted in up to 32.7% reductions from naive comparisons. Even in cases in which MAIC had little effect, ASM brought an additional change of 11.1% to 15.4%. Overall, the HR range of avelumab versus other treatments changed from 0.83 to 1.25 for naive comparisons to 0.76 to 0.99 after ASM plus MAIC, numerically favoring avelumab. CONCLUSIONS: Small variations in assessment schedules can introduce bias in unanchored indirect treatment comparisons of interval-censored time-to-event outcomes. In this study, adjusted PFS was comparable across second-line urothelial carcinoma treatment options, numerically favoring avelumab versus immunotherapies and chemotherapy agents. Correcting this bias is especially important when HRs are applied in cost-effectiveness models to transition patients between states.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",34372979,

Supplementary data in the form of external comparators (ECs) can be used to provide clinical context to support these drug evaluations. In this study we characterized HTAs for SAT-based submissions, the use of supplementary EC data and outcomes from HTA review. METHODS: HTA Accelerator database was used to describe SAT-based HTA submissions with decisions (2011-2019). RESULTS: A total of 433 SAT-based HTA submissions were identified between 2011 and 2019 with a 13-fold increase during this period. Around 65%(283/433) were in oncology or hem-oncology. Around 52%(226/433) of submissions contained some type of EC data, including prior clinical trials (24%, 104) and real-world data (RWD) (20%, 87), but 40%(175) contained no EC data. The overall acceptance rate for SAT-based submissions was 48% and with RWD EC data acceptance was 59%. In the latest 5-year period (2015-2019), use of RWD ECs increased 22% as a proportion of submissions per year, whereas, prior trial ECs decreased (-14%) and use of no EC remained stable (-2%). Between 2015 to 2017 and 2018 to 2019, acceptance rate for RWD ECs increased by 20% (41% in 2015-2017 to 61% in 2018-2019) whereas prior trial EC use decreased by 10% and no EC submissions decreased 16%. Of 226 submissions using ECs, only 29%(66) used an adjusted indirect treatment comparison method. CONCLUSIONS: SAT-based submissions to HTA bodies are rapidly evolving in terms of composition and acceptance. Types of EC and methodological approach used are important determinants of positive outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read,methodological | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_original_article",34372977,

METHODS: A total of 20 New Zealand rabbits (half male and half female) were randomly and equally divided into control and model groups. The chronic gastritis model was established by gavage of 5% sodium salicylate each day for 5 weeks, while the rabbits of the control group received gavage of clear water at the same volume. Morphological changes of the tissues of gastric mucosa, otopoint ""Stomach"" and auricular control point were observed under light microscope after staining with hematoxylin-eosin (H.E.), and given scores (0-3 points) according to the levels of inflammatory cells. The ultrastructural changes of the otopoint ""Stomach"" tissue were observed under transmission electronic microscope (TEM). RESULTS: H.E. staining revealed smoothness of the gastric smooth muscle with no or a few of inflammatory cells in the control group, and appearance of gastric mucosal hemorrhage and erosion, slightly disordered epithelial glands and infiltration of a large number of lymphocytes in the mucosal layer with some clustered lymphocyte aggregation foci in the model group. The pathological score of gastric mucous in the model group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.01). Under light microscope, no obvious changes were observed in the skin of the otopoint ""Stomach"" of the control group and the control point of the model group, whereas hyperplasia and abscission in the epidermic cuticle and spinous layer and basal layer, dermal tissue and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in the otopoint ""Stomach"" of the model group. Results of TEM observation showed no significant changes in the ultrastructure of the otopoint ""Stomach"" in the control group, and swollen and vacuolated epidermal keratinocyte mitochondria, reduced keratin filament aggregation, widened local cell space, unclear desmosome structure, activation of the dermal fibroblasts, and an increase of the myelinated nerve mitochondria in the ""Stomach"" region in the model group.

This study compared the efficacy and consumption of rVIII-SingleChain (lonoctocog alfa, AFSTYLA(®)) with rAHF-PFM (octocog alfa, Advate(®)) and rFVIIIFc (efmoroctocog alfa, Elocta(®)), for the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes in previously treated adolescents/adults with severe haemophilia A, through a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). METHODS: A systematic literature review identified published clinical trials for rAHF-PFM and rFVIIIFc. Individual patient data for rVIII-SingleChain were used to match baseline patient characteristics to those from published trials, using an approach similar to propensity score weighting. After matching, annualized bleeding rates (ABR), percentage of patients with zero bleeds, and rFVIII consumption were compared across trial populations. RESULTS: Published data were identified from two rAHF-PFM trials and one rFVIIIFc trial. rVIII-SingleChain had similar ABR (risk ratio [RR]: 0.74 [0.16; 3.48]; RR: 1.18 [0.85; 1.65]) and percentage of patients with zero bleeds (odds ratio [OR]: 1.34 [0.56; 3.22]; OR: 0.78 [0.47; 1.31]) versus rAHF-PFM and rFVIIIFc, respectively. Annual rVIII-SingleChain consumption was significantly lower than rAHF-PFM (mean difference: - 1507.66 IU/kg/year [- 2011.71; - 1003.61]) and equivalent to rFVIIIFc (RR: 0.96 [0.62; 1.49]). CONCLUSION: Although limited to published information for comparator trials, these results suggest that with an annualized rFVIII consumption comparable to rFVIIIFc, but significantly lower than rAHF-PFM, routine prophylaxis with rVIII-SingleChain is able to maintain a similar ABR and percentage of patients with zero bleeds, attesting to the long-acting nature of rVIII-SingleChain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",34368918,PMC8408075

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness (CE) of empagliflozin + SoC in comparison to sitagliptin + SoC and liraglutide + SoC based on the respective CVOT. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes Model (CDM) was calibrated to reproduce the CVOT outcomes. EMPA-REG OUTCOME baseline characteristics and CVOT specific treatment effects on risk factors for cardiovascular disease (HbA1c, BMI, blood pressure, lipids) were applied. Three-year observed cardiovascular events of empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and liraglutide + SoC were derived from EMPA-REG OUTCOME and an indirect treatment comparison. Relative risk adjustments to calibrate the CDM were obtained after a trial and error process to match as closely the observed and CDM-predicted outcomes. The drug-specific treatment effects were considered up until HbA1c reached 8.5% and treatment switch occurred. After this switch, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 82 risk equations predicted events based on co-existing risk factors and treatment intensification to basal bolus insulin were applied. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system applying 3% discounting. The time horizon was lifelong. RESULTS: Empagliflozin + SoC provides additional Quality Adjusted Life years (QALY + 0.564) for an incremental cost of 42,497RMB (US$6053) compared to sitagliptin + SoC, resulting in an Incremental Cost Utility Ratio of 75,349RMB (US$10,732), thus below the willingness-to-pay threshold of 212,676RMB, corresponding to three times the Gross Domestic Product in China (2019). Compared to liraglutide + SoC, empagliflozin + SoC use leads to 0.211QALY gained and cost savings of 71,427RMB (US$10,173) and is as such dominant. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results.

METHODS: Systematic literature review and indirect treatment comparisons were conducted of randomized controlled trials reporting efficacy and safety outcomes. Efficacy was characterized by Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Ashworth Scale (AS) up to 16-weeks post-injection. Results were used to inform a cost-effectiveness model with a 1-year time horizon, linking response rates with health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes and costs from a UK perspective. Other data sources included in the cost-effectiveness model were drug unit costs, health care resource utilization based on UK physician survey, and HRQoL impacts of adverse events associated with oral anti-spasticity therapies. Results were characterized as cost per quality-adjusted life year and cost per responder. RESULTS: Six studies were included in evidence syntheses. There was a trend towards greater response rate for aboBoNT-A which resulted in improved HRQoL and lower annual costs compared with onaBoNT-A. Safety outcomes were similar across BoNT-A therapies. In cost-effectiveness analysis, aboBoNT-A was an economically dominant therapy with respect to cost per quality-adjusted life year. The cost per responder at 1 year was estimated to be £39,056 for aboBoNT-A vs. £54,831 for onaBoNT-A. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on observed safety and efficacy data, aboBoNT-A is estimated to result in higher treatment response and consequently increased quality-of-life and reduced costs, vs. onaBoNT-A in children with upper limb spasticity. Limitations to the study include study heterogeneity limited details available for onaBoNT-A studies (e.g. use of physical therapy), and limited availability of responder data. Where assumptions were required, they were made to be conservative towards aboBoN-A.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34340647,

We used the frequentist model to analyze the survival and toxicity data between different treatments. Pooled analysis for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and events of toxicity were analyzed in this study. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were involved in this network meta-analysis. The comparisons on OS and PFS showed that modified FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB had similar treatment efficacy (OS: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.78-1.63; PFS: HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.85-1.67). GEM-NAB was more effective than modified FOLFIRINOX based on the result of ORR (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.04-1.96). Moreover, our analysis showed a similar toxicity profile between modified FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence showed that modified FOLFIRINOX and GEM-NAB were similar in survival and toxicity. Many factors should be considered for in the formulation of optimal treatment, and our meta-analysis could provide some guidance to treatment selection in the first-line setting for advanced PC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34301232,PMC8306351

A published matching-adjusted indirect comparison found the two regimens yield comparable overall and progression-free survival outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare direct medical costs of pembrolizumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab for PD-L1-positive metastatic NSCLC treatment within the first 3 years following treatment initiation from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-minimization model was built to estimate and compare treatment, disease management, and adverse event costs based on KEYNOTE-024 and -042, and CheckMate 227 Part 1a trial survival and adverse event data. RESULTS: 1L pembrolizumab generates $54,343, $75,744, and $76,259 per patient cost savings compared with 1L nivolumab plus ipilimumab for patients with NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 1% within 1, 2, and 3 years of treatment initiation, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab is cost saving as 1L treatment for PD-L1-positive metastatic NSCLC in comparison with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, at least for the short term.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc",34292540,PMC8611160

This enables flexible, individualized treatment schedules, which reduce the burden of prophylaxis and improve patient outcomes. This analysis compared the efficacy of recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) and recombinant factor IX albumin fusion protein (rIX-FP), two EHL therapies approved for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in hemophilia B. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) was used to adjust the between-treatment differences in baseline characteristics. Individual patient data for rFIXFc (B-LONG) were matched to aggregated data for rIX-FP (PROLONG-9FP) followed by statistical comparison for estimated annualized bleeding rate (ABR) using a Poisson regression model with adjustment for over dispersion. Data were analyzed according to treatment regimen prior to study entry: prior prophylaxis (rFIXFc, n=48; rIX-FP, n=40) or prior episodic treatment (n=43 and n=19, respectively). Relative treatment effects are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline characteristics, estimated ABR observed for rFIXFc and rIX-FP was not significantly different in patients on prior prophylaxis (1.87 versus 1.58; IRR 1.18, 95% CI 0.67-2.10) or prior episodic (2.25 versus 2.22; IRR 1.01 95% CI 0.40-2.57) regimens. CONCLUSION: This MAIC analysis shows that the estimated ABR for rFIXFc-treated patients from B-LONG was similar to that of rIX-FP-treated patients from PROLONG-9FP and, therefore, indicates that the two EHL therapies provide similar efficacy when used as prophylaxis for patients with hemophilia B. Trough levels differ between the two products (1-3% [targeted] versus 20% [observed], respectively), suggesting that trough level is not a surrogate indicator when ABR is used as a criterion for clinical efficacy when comparing these FIX products in hemophilia B.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",34285621,PMC8286734

We examined generalizability of HTE detected using causal forests in two similarly designed randomized trials in type II diabetes patients. Methods We evaluated published HTE of intensive versus standard glycemic control on all-cause mortality from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes study (ACCORD) in a second trial, the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT). We then applied causal forests to VADT, ACCORD, and pooled data from both studies and compared variable importance and subgroup effects across samples. Results HTE in ACCORD did not replicate in similar subgroups in VADT, but variable importance was correlated between VADT and ACCORD (Kendall's tau-b 0.75). Applying causal forests to pooled individual-level data yielded seven subgroups with similar HTE across both studies, ranging from risk difference of all-cause mortality of -3.9% (95% CI -7.0, -0.8) to 4.7% (95% CI 1.8, 7.5). Conclusions Machine learning detection of HTE subgroups from randomized trials may not generalize across study samples even when variable importance is correlated. Pooling individual-level data may overcome differences in study populations and/or differences in interventions that limit HTE generalizability.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",34280545,PMC8748294

OBJECTIVE: To determine which of the 2 therapies would result in the lowest overall cost from a US health plan perspective, under the assumption of equivalent clinical efficacy and safety. METHODS: A cost-minimization model was developed in Microsoft Excel. The model incorporated only costs that differ between the treatments, including drug acquisition, administration, and monitoring costs, over a 52-week horizon. Average dosing for EPAG and ROMI was taken from the long-term EXTEND trial and from a published metaanalysis of 14 clinical trials, respectively. ROMI is injectable and EPAG is oral, so only ROMI had administration costs. The model assumed patients used 25 mg EPAG tablets and the 250 μg vial size of ROMI. ROMI wastage was included in drug acquisition costs by rounding up average dose to the nearest whole vial. Monitoring requirements were determined from US prescribing information, with platelet monitoring assumed equal, and hepatic panel testing every 4 weeks for EPAG. The model was adjustable to commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid plan perspectives, with optional inclusion of drug wastage, monitoring, or administration costs. RESULTS: The base case used a commercial plan perspective, with average dosing of 51.5 mg/day for EPAG and 4.20 μg/kg/week for ROMI. The analysis found a cost difference per treated patient of $64,770 in favor of EPAG on an annual basis. Breakdown by unique costs for EPAG included drug-acquisition cost of $123,135 and monitoring cost of $705. Breakdown by unique costs for ROMI included drug-acquisition cost of $183,234, with wastage of $63,179 and administration cost of $5,377. Based on a hypothetical commercial plan with 1 million members and an estimated 11 patients with cITP receiving ROMI, potential annual savings for switching all patients from ROMI to EPAG is $712,473 or $0.06 per member per month. EPAG remained the less costly option for all plan types and assumptions. A sensitivity analysis found that the result was most sensitive to drug pricing and wastage inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Because of lower drug-acquisition costs (including drug wastage) and administration costs, treatment of cITP with EPAG is associated with a lower net cost per patient than ROMI.

There is no head-to-head CVOT comparing these treatments and heterogeneity between their CVOTs renders conventional indirect comparison inappropriate. Therefore, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to compare the effects of s.c. semaglutide and dulaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with and without established cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Individual patient data from SUSTAIN 6 were matched with aggregate data from REWIND, using a propensity score method to balance baseline effect-modifying patient characteristics. Hazard ratios (HRs) for three-point (3P) MACE (CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke), anchored via placebo, were then indirectly compared between balanced populations. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the main analysis. RESULTS: After matching, included effect modifiers were balanced. In the main analysis, s.c. semaglutide was associated with a statistically significant 35% reduction in 3P MACE versus placebo (HR, 0.65 [95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.48, 0.87]) and nonsignificantly greater reduction (26%) versus dulaglutide (HR, 0.74 [95% CI; 0.54, 1.01]). Results were supported by all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a statistically significant lower risk of 3P MACE for s.c. semaglutide versus placebo, in a population with lower prevalence of pre-existing CVD than that in the pre-specified primary analysis in SUSTAIN 6. Reduction in 3P MACE with s.c. semaglutide was greater than with dulaglutide, although not statistically significant.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",34277983,PMC8279621

Platinum-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been extensively researched in recent years as promising treatments in the neoadjuvant setting. However, clinical data is lacking in direct comparisons of these two treating regimens. METHODS: We conducted an online search on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Online Library and key oncological meetings for available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating ICIs or platinum drugs versus anthracyclines and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AT-based NACT). Conventional meta-analyses were conducted separately, and then indirect comparisons for clinical efficacy and safety profile were performed between ICIs and platinum drugs using AT-based NACT as a common comparator. RESULTS: Seven random controlled trials (RCTs) with 1,647 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The indirect comparison demonstrated that ICIs plus chemotherapy significantly improved pathological complete response (pCR) rate (p = 0.00445, OR, 1.78; 95%CI, 0.70-4.53), and decreased the adverse effect (AE) related discontinuance versus platinum-based chemotherapy (P = 0.00015; OR 0.46; 95%CI, 0.26-0.82). CONCLUSION: ICIs plus chemotherapy showed increased pCR rate and decreased adverse effects compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in early TNBC. However, subgroup analysis and survival data to explore the proper patients for each treatment remains scarce. Therefore, further studies with powered direct comparisons of these two treating regimens are required.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34277438,PMC8281677

The current study aimed to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of add-on anti-seizure medications in DS. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE database search and a manual search was done using keywords; ""antiepileptic"", ""Dravet syndrome"" and ""antiseizure"". The primary efficacy outcome was ≥50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency from baseline while the safety outcome was treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Frequentist approach were used for combining direct and indirect evidence and network plots prepared. The drugs were ranked based on p-scores obtained using the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA). Heterogeneity across studies was calculated by I(2) statistic and Q test. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 565 patients with DS (2-20 years) who received placebo or any of the three active interventions (stiripentol, cannabidiol, and fenfluramine) were included. Compared with placebo, all the three drugs were associated with a significant reduction in convulsive seizure frequency from baseline. Stiripentol had the highest probability ranking for ≥50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency from baseline [OR: 20.2; 95% CI: 2.1-198.0] and for occurrence of any treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) [OR:53.9; 95% CI: 1.4 to 2079.8] followed by fenfluramine and cannabidiol. However, for serious TEAEs, the ranking order was stiripentol followed by cannabidiol and fenfluramine. The trial on stiripentol had limited sample size explaining the wide confidence intervals for the comparative outcomes. CONCLUSION: In this indirect comparison, fenfluramine and stiripentol hadd comparable efficacy but fenfluramine appeareded to be safer in terms of less frequent serious TEAEs. Cannabidiol had relatively lower efficacy and was associated with serious TEAEs. A head-to-head trial between stiripentol, cannabidiol and fenfluramine is the need of the hour.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34274891,

However, the long-term clinical and economic impact of using bosutinib versus dasatinib and nilotinib has not been evaluated. The objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of bosutinib compared with dasatinib and bosutinib compared with nilotinib from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using partition survival methods and three health states: progression-free, progression, and death. Trial data (individual patient-level and aggregate-level data) informed the progression-free and overall survival estimates. Costs included drugs and medical resource use. Utility values were obtained from literature. Sensitivity analyses (SAs) included one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs). RESULTS: Comparing bosutinib versus dasatinib resulted in a gain of 0.4 discounted life years, 1.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental costs of $28,459 (values in 2020 US dollars), for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $19,811/QALY gained. Comparing bosutinib versus nilotinib resulted in a gain of 0.8 discounted life-years, 1.8 QALYs, and incremental costs of $76,563, for an ICER of $41,932/QALY gained. Drug costs and extrapolation distribution type were the main drivers of the model in the one-way SAs. In the PSAs, bosutinib had >90% and >80% probabilities of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY versus dasatinib and nilotinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that compared with dasatinib and nilotinib, bosutinib may represent good value for money for treating 2L CP-CML patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc",34250585,PMC8545733

An important recent innovation in RF ablation is Ablation Index (AI), known also as the VISITAG SURPOINT™ Module, a composite lesion quality marker whose use has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of acute and late pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection and the recurrence of atrial arrhythmias in PsAF. Due to a lack of direct comparative evidence between the latest generations of technologies, there is uncertainty regarding the best treatment option in PsAF. The objective of the present study was to conduct a matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) using individual patient-level data (IPD) to assess the comparative effectiveness of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH™ Catheter or the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH™ SF Catheter with AI/VISITAG SURPOINT™ Module (STAI) versus the second-generation CB catheter (Arctic Front Advance™; herein referred to as CB) with respect to 12-month atrial arrhythmia recurrence, fluoroscopy time, and procedural efficiency. METHODS: IPD for STAI were obtained from four investigator-initiated studies and were pooled. Comparable CB studies identified from a systematic literature review were also pooled. In the absence of a common treatment arm between STAI and CB studies, an unanchored MAIC was conducted. The primary analysis compared the pooled STAI IPD to the pooled CB cohort, with corrections for differences across trials, including eligibility criteria and patient baseline characteristics. Scenario and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the primary analysis. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, which was adjusted for left atrial diameter (LAD), age, diabetes, and sex, STAI was associated with a statistically significant 65% relative reduction in the rate of arrhythmia recurrence compared to CB at 12-month follow-up (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.23, 0.52). STAI was associated with shorter total fluoroscopy time than CB but longer procedure time. Results were consistent across scenario and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency ablation with AI significantly reduced atrial arrhythmia recurrence at 12-month follow-up and fluoroscopy time compared to CB, with longer procedure times.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",34250584,PMC8342373

Onasemnogene abeparvovec was compared with nusinersen using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to estimate the treatment effect of onasemnogene abeparvovec relative to nusinersen for the treatment of symptomatic patients with SMA type 1 for up to 24 months of follow-up. METHODS: In the absence of studies for both onasemnogene abeparvovec and nusinersen with a common comparator, a Bayesian naïve indirect treatment comparison (ITC) and MAIC between onasemnogene abeparvovec and nusinersen were conducted to compare efficacy and safety of onasemnogene abeparvovec with nusinersen. Outcomes of interest were event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and motor milestone achievements (independent sitting and independent walking). Relative treatment effects were expressed as relative risk (RR) and risk difference.

A numerically greater likelihood of walking by 18 and 24 months was also observed for patients treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec compared with nusinersen. Onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy was also associated with a favorable (but statistically nonsignificant) outcome for OS and may be associated with prolonged survival compared with nusinersen (HR of onasemnogene abeparvovec vs. nusinersen: 0.35 [95% CI: 0.09-1.32; 99% CI: 0.06-2.01]). Bayesian naïve ITC results were similar to the MAIC analysis for EFS, OS, and motor milestone achievements. Small sample size limited covariate matching to baseline CHOP INTEND and nutritional support requirement, leading to wider CIs and statistically inconclusive outcomes for some of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations of the current MAIC analysis (mainly a small sample size for statistical testing, even for the pooled onasemnogene abeparvovec trials, and potential differences in prognostic and predictive factors between studies), the relative treatment effects in EFS, OS, and motor milestone achievement indicate that onasemnogene abeparvovec may offer continued benefit compared with nusinersen through 24 months of follow-up.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read",34236007,

Popular methods include matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) and simulated treatment comparison (STC). There is limited formal evaluation of these methods and whether they can be used to accurately compare treatments. Thus, we undertake a comprehensive simulation study to compare standard unadjusted indirect comparisons, MAIC and STC across 162 scenarios. This simulation study assumes that the trials are investigating survival outcomes and measure continuous covariates, with the log hazard ratio as the measure of effect. MAIC yields unbiased treatment effect estimates under no failures of assumptions. The typical usage of STC produces bias because it targets a conditional treatment effect where the target estimand should be a marginal treatment effect. The incompatibility of estimates in the indirect comparison leads to bias as the measure of effect is non-collapsible. Standard indirect comparisons are systematically biased, particularly under stronger covariate imbalance and interaction effects. Standard errors and coverage rates are often valid in MAIC but the robust sandwich variance estimator underestimates variability where effective sample sizes are small. Interval estimates for the standard indirect comparison are too narrow and STC suffers from bias-induced undercoverage. MAIC provides the most accurate estimates and, with lower degrees of covariate overlap, its bias reduction outweighs the loss in precision under no failures of assumptions. An important future objective is the development of an alternative formulation to STC that targets a marginal treatment effect.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",34196111,

METHODS: A US hospital-based budget impact model was developed to estimate the impact of ECP in reducing the surgical complication of anastomotic leak. The incremental acquisition cost of ECP vs SOC was compared to the net potential savings from reduced complication costs. The model was based on complication rates from a recently published matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) that compared clinical and healthcare utilization outcomes of patients using ECP with those of a propensity score-matched retrospective SOC control cohort from a real-world clinical practice population. The model assessed total cost, average length of stay (LOS), proportion of patients with a non-home discharge, and all-cause readmission. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model assumptions and inputs. RESULTS: Despite a higher device cost of $412 for ECP compared with $298 for a manual stapler, annual savings due to avoided complications with ECP was $53,987 for anastomotic leak, assuming 100 procedures per year with each type of circular stapler. ECP also helped to avoid 27 LOS days, 0.38 readmissions and 0.22 non-home discharges. Sensitivity analyses around potential drivers of costs established the robustness of economic savings with the use of ECP - with annual savings being most impacted by the probability of anastomotic leak complication in the DSA. CONCLUSION: This model demonstrates that among patients undergoing left-sided colectomy procedures, the incremental cost of using the ECHELON CIRCULAR™ Powered Stapler instead of a manual circular stapler was offset by the savings from lowered incidence and cost of management of anastomotic leaks in the hospital setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc",34168470,PMC8217739

METHODS: A Markov model with a 4-week cycle length was used to compare MEP with BEN and RES as therapies added to SoC in the management of SEA, in terms of cost per QALY gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs (€2019) were obtained from public sources, while utilities and transition probabilities were retrieved from literature, e.g. network meta-analysis. Continuation criteria for biological treatment and reduction of oral corticosteroids (OCS) was set at 50% minimum reduction of exacerbation rate. Adverse events related to chronic OCS use included diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts, acute myocardial infarct, and peptic ulcer. The analysis was performed over a 5-year time horizon from the National Healthcare System (NHCS) perspective, with a yearly discount rate of 3% applied to both costs and QALYs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis were performed to address uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: On top of SoC, the model indicates that MEP is dominant (lower cost, higher benefit) compared to BEN and RES: For BEN and RES, respectively, treatment with MEP had a point estimate of 0.076 and 0.075 additional QALYs, and savings of €3,173.47 and €7,772.95 per patient. The findings were robust to variation as estimated using sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: MEP is a cost-effective treatment in comparison with BEN and RES added to SoC for patients with SEA in the Spanish setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34114935,

Its cost-effectiveness (CE) was previously evaluated based on interim trial analyses (follow-up ∼1 year). The present analysis describes CE incorporating additional follow-up based on protocol-specified final trial analyses (1-1.5 years additional follow-up), from a US healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: A partitioned survival model is used to compare pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs chemotherapy using data from the KN189 (non-squamous patients) and KN407 (squamous patients) clinical trials. An indirect treatment comparison vs pembrolizumab monotherapy is made for patient subgroups with PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and 1-49% based on data from the KN024 and KN042 trials. Efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility, and safety data are derived from trials and projected over 20 years. Costs for drugs, non-drug disease management, and adverse events are also incorporated. RESULTS: Overall, versus chemotherapy alone, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is projected to increase life expectancy by 1.12 years (3.35 vs 2.23) and 0.67 years (3.17 vs 2.50) in non-squamous and squamous patients, respectively. Resultant ICERs ($158,030/QALY and $178,387/QALY) are below a US 3-times GDP per capita threshold ($195,000/QALY). ICERs vs chemotherapy also generally fall below the threshold within PD-L1 sub-groups (except in squamous PD-L1 < 1%, which may have differed due to small sample size) while ICERs vs pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 ≥ 50% and 1-49% sub-groups generally exceed it (except in squamous PD-L1 1-49%); largely a result of the higher drug acquisition cost of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy relative to differences in life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, with longer-term trial follow-up and in the context of prior literature, in the US, one of the two options for pembrolizumab use (either pembrolizumab + chemotherapy or pembrolizumab monotherapy), represents a cost-effective treatment in virtually all non-squamous and squamous metastatic NSCLC patient populations and PD-L1 sub-groups evaluated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34098842,

Comparison between CGRPmAbs and previously approved Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) will inform optimal preventive treatment of chronic migraine, but head-to-head trials are lacking. We therefore aimed to perform adjusted indirect comparison between CGRPmAbs and BoNT-A through a meta-analysis. Methods: OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, clinical registries, and government websites were searched from inception to September 2019. Randomized controlled trials comparing CGRPmAbs or BoNT-A with placebo in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine were included. The primary outcomes were headache days and migraine days measured at week 12. Data were synthesized by using a frequentist approach; and the treatments were ranked by P-score. Results: We included 10 trials (n = 4,678) after screening 1049 candidates. Six trials were with low risk of bias. Fremanezumab had an effect similar to BoNT-A in the reduction of headache days at week 12 (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.08, 95%CI -0.55 to -0.7). Galcanezumab reduced more migraine days than BoNT-A at week 12 (SMD, -0.94, 95%CI -1.24 to -0.63); fremanezumab showed similar findings (SMD, -0.55, 95%CI -0.85 to -0.24). Galcanezumab and fremanezumab had better effect in mitigating headache impact at week 12. CGRPmAbs and BoNT-A had similar adverse event rate. Conclusion: CGRPmAbs and BoNT-A had similar effect in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. BoNT-A might be preferentially selected owing to its cost-effectiveness profiles.

We examined the cost-effectiveness of second- or third-line+ (2L+ or 3L+) lorlatinib in Sweden, versus chemotherapy. METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (progression free, progressed, or death) was used. Lorlatinib relative efficacy versus chemotherapy was derived using unanchored matching adjusted indirect treatment comparisons from a phase 2 clinical trial. Utility data were derived from the same trial and published studies. Costs (year 2019) were obtained from Swedish national data. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum using a societal perspective (base case). Model robustness was evaluated with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For 2L+, the average discounted total quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain was 1.29 years. Total incremental costs were Swedish krona (SEK) 731,791, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SEK 566,278 per QALY gained. Non-discounted survival gain amounted to 1.94 years. For 3L+, the average discounted total QALY gain was 1.25 years. Total incremental costs were SEK 754,801, resulting in an ICER of SEK 603,934 per QALY gained. Non-discounted survival gain was 1.88 years. Sensitivity analyses were consistent. CONCLUSIONS: ICERs ranged from SEK 421,000 to SEK 384,066 less than the boundary for a cost-effective treatment for a high-severity disease in Sweden (SEK 988,000), suggesting 2L+ or 3L+ lorlatinib is a cost-effective treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC versus chemotherapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics,FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""MAIC described in supplemental material, and in a congress abstract, but so full details not present in the corpus""]}",34080140,PMC8298221

Thus, comparisons between non-reference treatments rely on indirect evidence, and are based on the unidentifiable consistency assumption, limiting the reliability of the results. We suggest a method of performing a sensitivity analysis through data imputation to assess the robustness of results with an unknown degree of inconsistency. METHODS: The method involves imputation of data for randomized controlled trials comparing non-reference treatments, to produce a complete network. The imputed data simulate a situation that would allow mixed treatment comparison, with a statistically acceptable extent of inconsistency. By comparing the agreement between the results obtained from the original star-shaped network meta-analysis and the results after incorporating the imputed data, the robustness of the results of the original star-shaped network meta-analysis can be quantified and assessed. To illustrate this method, we applied it to two real datasets and some simulated datasets. RESULTS: Applying the method to the star-shaped network formed by discarding all comparisons between non-reference treatments from a real complete network, 33% of the results from the analysis incorporating imputed data under acceptable inconsistency indicated that the treatment ranking would be different from the ranking obtained from the star-shaped network. Through a simulation study, we demonstrated the sensitivity of the results after data imputation for a star-shaped network with different levels of within- and between-study variability. An extended usability of the method was also demonstrated by another example where some head-to-head comparisons were incorporated. CONCLUSIONS: Our method will serve as a practical technique to assess the reliability of results from a star-shaped network meta-analysis under the unverifiable consistency assumption.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",34074239,PMC8171049

METHODS: Patients in the ECP trial cohort were propensity score matched to those in the historical cohort through nearest neighbor matching. Outcomes included 30-day readmission rates; length of stay (LOS) for the index admission; rates of anastomotic leak, pelvic abscess, ileus/small bowel obstruction, infection, bleeding, and stoma creation. RESULTS: The study included 168 patients in the ECP trial cohort and 4544 patients in the historical cohort; 165 ECP trial patients were matched to 1348 historical cohort patients. After matching, conversions were more prevalent in the historical cohort than the ECP trial cohort (4.2% ECP vs. 10.2% historical, p = 0.001). Relative to the historical cohort, the ECP trial cohort had statistically significant lower rates of 30-day inpatient readmission (6.1% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.019), anastomotic leak (1.8% vs. 6.9%, p < 0.001), ileus/small bowel obstruction (4.8% vs. 14.7%, p < 0.001), infection (1.8% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.001), and bleeding (1.8% vs. 9.2%, p < 0.001) during the index admission or within 30 days thereafter. No statistically significant differences in rates of pelvic abscess, stoma creation, or LOS were found between the two cohorts. Three sensitivity analyses to address the difference in conversion rates yielded largely consistent results, with loss of statistical significance for inpatient admission in some cases.

METHODS: Two cost-utility models were constructed for the two licensed indications using similar methodologies but indication-specific data. Clinical efficacy data were based on pooled analyses of clinical trials for tisagenlecleucel (pALL: ELIANA, ENSIGN, B2101J; DLBCL: JULIET, NCT02030834) and published data for comparator treatments. Treatment effects were compared based on matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) analyses. Four clinical lymphoma and leukaemia experts provided Switzerland-specific input regarding comparators, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, clinical evidence and costs, which were used to inform the models. The base case analysis reflected the perspective of the Swiss mandatory health insurance system. Deterministic, probabilistic and scenario analyses were carried out to explore the robustness of results. RESULTS: The base case analysis resulted in incremental costs of CHF 31,961-CHF 36,419 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for pALL across the different comparators and CHF 113,179 for DLBCL (1 CHF = 1.09 USD). Incremental costs per life-year gained ranged between CHF 33,906-CHF 97,399 across the two indications. Including productivity gains, tisagenlecleucel was shown to be dominant (more effective and less costly) over all the comparators for pALL and to result in incremental costs per life-year gained of CHF 57,324 for DLBCL. CONCLUSION: Using hypothetical willingness-to-pay thresholds of CHF 100,000-150,000 per QALY gained, the present analysis has shown tisagenlecleucel to be a cost-effective treatment option in pALL and DLBCL.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics,FULL_ARTICLE,results_not_described | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: result_not_described | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""MAIC results not described in the article, and barely described in supplemental materials, and not described in another article""]}",34021886,

When matched to the STRIVE trial, rimegepant was superior to placebo -1.59 [-2.15, -1.03] and was not statistically significantly different from erenumab -0.06 [-0.61, 0.50]. Rimegepant showed superior MIDAS and MSQv2 results compared with placebo in both EVOLVE trials and in the STRIVE trial, no statistically significant differences from galcanezumab and erenumab regarding MIDAS, and favorable results compared with erenumab across all MSQv2 domains, while being generally similar to galcanezumab across all MSQv2 domains. CONCLUSIONS: When adjustments were made to reflect baseline characteristics in published literature, supporting data from BHV3000-201 suggest that rimegepant every other day is an effective therapy in reducing disability and MMDs and enhancing migraine-specific HRQoL. These data support the preventive benefit observed in randomized trials of rimegepant and further validate its efficacy for both acute and preventive treatment of migraine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",34021585,PMC8361942

This method is doubly robust in the sense that if either the outcome model or the probability of trial participation is correctly specified, then the estimate of the target population average treatment effect is consistent. Furthermore, we only require the sample moments of the effect modifiers drawn from the target population to consistently estimate the target population average treatment effect. We compared the finite-sample performance of entropy balancing with several alternative methods for transporting treatment effects between populations. Entropy balancing techniques are efficient and robust to violations of model misspecification. We also examine the results of our proposed method in an applied analysis of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Blood Pressure trial transported to a sample of US adults with diabetes taken from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cohort.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic,methodological",34018204,PMC8487904

However, there is no direct evidence for their relative effectiveness and safety. In this study, we conducted an indirect treatment comparison to compare the efficacy and safety of CGRP monoclonal antibody with botulinum toxin for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. Methods: Up to August 31, 2020, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central). Weighted mean difference (WMD) and relative risk (RR) were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. Indirect treatment comparison (ITC) software was used to conduct indirect treatment comparison. Results: Ten studies were pooled with 6,325 patients in our meta-analysis. Both botulinum toxin and CGRP monoclonal antibody demonstrated favorable efficacy in the change of migraine days, headache days, HIT-6 score, and 50% migraine responder rate compared with placebo. In indirect treatment comparison, CGRP monoclonal antibody was superior to botulinum toxin in the frequency of acute analgesics intake (WMD = -1.31, 95% CI: -3.394 to 0.774, p = 0.02113), the rate of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (RR = 0.664, 95% CI: 0.469 to 0.939, p = 0.04047), and the rate of treatment-related serious adverse events (RR = 0.505, 95% CI: 0.005 to 46.98, p < 0.001). Conclusion: For chronic migraine patients, CGRP monoclonal antibody was slightly better than botulinum toxin in terms of efficacy and safety. In the future, head-to-head trials would be better to evaluate the efficacy and safety between different medications in the prevention of chronic migraine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",34012392,PMC8126691

In the absence of randomized head-to-head trials, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) can be used to adjust for cross-trial differences and evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of these agents. We used MAIC methodology to indirectly compare key outcomes with ozanimod (OZM) and teriflunomide (TERI) in the treatment of RMS. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of OZM vs TERI. Given the absence of head-to-head trials of OZM vs TERI, we used a matching-adjusted indirect comparison to adjust for potential treatment effect modifiers and prognostic factors while assessing confirmed disability progression (CDP), relapse, and safety outcomes. Individual patient data for OZM (SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B trials) and aggregate level data for TERI (ASCLEPIOS I/II, TOWER, OPTIMUM, and TEMSO trials) were used to evaluate the following outcomes: annualized relapse rate (ARR), proportion of patients relapsed, CDP at 3 and 6 months, overall adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and discontinuations due to AEs. RESULTS: After matching, baseline patient characteristics were balanced between OZM and TERI. Compared with TERI, OZM demonstrated significant improvements in ARR (rate ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62-0.84), proportion of patients relapsed (odds ratio [OR]: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.44-0.70), overall AEs (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.29-0.43), SAEs (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.37-0.77), and discontinuations due to AEs (OR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.09-0.21). OZM demonstrated statistically significant improvements in CDP at 3 months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66-0.92) but nonsignificant differences at 6 months (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.60-1.01) compared with TERI.

Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) is an investigational CAR T-cell therapy that has shown promising activity in this setting. We used an unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) methodology to compare liso-cel, using individual patient-level data from the TRANSCEND NHL 001 (TRANSCEND; NCT02631044) trial, to salvage chemotherapy, using summary-level data from the SCHOLAR-1 study, for the treatment of patients with R/R LBCL. Standardized mean differences were used to evaluate imbalances between the TRANSCEND and SCHOLAR-1 studies. MAIC was conducted to determine the relative efficacy of liso-cel vs. salvage chemotherapy with regard to overall survival, complete response rate, and objective response rate. For all efficacy outcomes assessed, comparisons of clinical factors before MAIC showed that five of seven baseline characteristics were similar between the TRANSCEND and SCHOLAR-1 studies; however, age and R/R to last therapy status differed between studies, thus requiring matching and adjusting to ensure the validity of this analysis. The base case analyses demonstrated a significantly lower risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4-0.6; p < 0.001) with significantly higher rates of complete response (odds ratio, 12.9; 95% CI 8.0-20.7) and objective response (odds ratio, 7.0; 95% CI 4.6-10.5) for patients treated with liso-cel than patients treated with salvage chemotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative benefit, risk, and immunogenicity of different rotavirus vaccines by synthesizing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies. DATA SOURCES: Relevant studies published in 4 databases: Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched until July 1, 2020, using search terms including ""rotavirus"" and ""vaccin*."" STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials and cohort and case-control studies involving more than 100 children younger than 5 years that reported the effectiveness, safety, or immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccines were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A random-effects model was used to calculate relative risks (RRs), odds ratios (ORs), risk differences, and 95% CIs. Adjusted indirect treatment comparison was performed to assess the differences in the protection of Rotarix and RotaTeq. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were RVGE, severe RVGE, and RVGE hospitalization. Safety-associated outcomes involved serious adverse events, intussusception, and mortality. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of 20 RCTs and 38 case-control studies revealed that Rotarix (RV1) significantly reduced RVGE (RR, 0.316 [95% CI, 0.224-0.345]) and RVGE hospitalization risk (OR, 0.347 [95% CI, 0.279-0.432]) among children fully vaccinated; RotaTeq (RV5) had similar outcomes (RVGE: RR, 0.350 [95% CI, 0.275-0.445]; RVGE hospitalization risk: OR, 0.272 [95% CI, 0.197-0.376]). Rotavirus vaccines also demonstrated higher protection against severe RVGE. Additionally, no significant differences in the protection of RV1 and RV5 against rotavirus disease were noted in adjusted indirect comparisons. Moderate associations were found between reduced RVGE risk and Rotavac (RR, 0.664 [95% CI, 0.548-0.804]), Rotasiil (RR, 0.705 [95% CI, 0.605-0.821]), and Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine (RR, 0.407 [95% CI, 0.332-0.499]). All rotavirus vaccines demonstrated no risk of serious adverse events. A positive correlation was also found between immunogenicity and vaccine protection (eg, association of RVGE with RV1: coefficient, -1.599; adjusted R2, 99.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The high protection and low risk of serious adverse events for rotavirus vaccines in children who were fully vaccinated emphasized the importance of worldwide introduction of rotavirus vaccination. Similar protection provided by Rotarix and RotaTeq relieves the pressure of vaccines selection for health care authorities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33970192,PMC8111566

Empagliflozin reduced major adverse CV event (MACE) by 14%, CV death by 38%, and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) by 35% vs placebo, each on top of standard of care (SoC). SGLT-2 inhibitors canagliflozin and dapagliflozin have also been compared with placebo, all on top of SoC, in CV outcome trials. In the CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) Program, canagliflozin reduced MACE by 14% and HHF by 33%. Dapagliflozin reduced HHF by 27% in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial (Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events). This analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or SoC, in US adults with T2DM and established CV disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individual patient-level discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict time-to-event for CV and renal outcomes, and specific adverse events over patients' lifetimes. Occurrence of events in EMPA-REG OUTCOME was estimated based on event-free survival curves with time-dependent covariates. An HR for canagliflozin or dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on each clinical event was estimated from published CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58, and EMPA-REG OUTCOME data using indirect treatment comparison. Public sources provided US costs and utilities. RESULTS: The model predicted longer survival for empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and SoC mainly due to direct reduction in CV death. Empagliflozin dominated canagliflozin, yielding more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; 0.38) at a lower cost (-US$306). Compared with dapagliflozin and SoC, empagliflozin yielded 0.50 and 0.84 incremental QALYs at US$1517 and US$27 539 incremental costs, yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$3054/QALY and US$32 848/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin was projected to dominate canagliflozin and be highly cost-effective compared with dapagliflozin and SoC using US healthcare costs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33941549,PMC8098979

Four databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science) were queried from inception to July 30, 2020. Two independent reviewers screened potentially relevant studies and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes of interest were symptom score (SS), medication score (MS), combined symptom medication score (CSMS), and Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Meta-analyses with an adjusted indirect comparison were conducted in RevMan 5.4.1. RESULTS: Seven SCIT versus SLIT randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated no significant differences for any outcomes, but insufficient data precluded direct meta-analysis. For the adjusted indirect comparison, 46 RCTs over 39 studies were included for SCIT versus placebo (n = 13) and SLIT versus placebo (n = 33).

The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head, which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of non-biological systemic agents, small molecules, and biologics for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network meta-analysis, and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: For this living systematic review we updated our searches of the following databases monthly to September 2020: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched two trials registers to the same date. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further references to eligible RCTs. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to placebo or another active agent. The primary outcomes of this review were: the proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 at induction phase (from 8 to 24 weeks after the randomisation), and the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) at induction phase. We did not evaluate differences in specific adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Several groups of two review authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the PASI 90 score) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse events). We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes and all comparisons, according to CINeMA, as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to infer on treatment hierarchy: 0% (treatment is the worst for effectiveness or safety) to 100% (treatment is the best for effectiveness or safety). MAIN RESULTS: We included 158 studies (18 new studies for the update) in our review (57,831 randomised participants, 67.2% men, mainly recruited from hospitals). The overall average age was 45 years; the overall mean PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo-controlled (58%), 30% were head-to-head studies, and 11% were multi-armed studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. We have assessed a total of 20 treatments. In all, 133 trials were multicentric (two to 231 centres). All but two of the outcomes included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation). We assessed many studies (53/158) as being at high risk of bias; 25 were at an unclear risk, and 80 at low risk. Most studies (123/158) declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 22 studies did not report their source of funding. Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (non-biological systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in reaching PASI 90. At class level, in reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the non-biological systemic agents. At drug level, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, risankizumab and guselkumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than ustekinumab and three anti-TNF alpha agents: adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept. Ustekinumab and adalimumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than etanercept; ustekinumab was more effective than certolizumab, and the clinical effectiveness of ustekinumab and adalimumab was similar. There was no significant difference between tofacitinib or apremilast and three non-biological drugs: fumaric acid esters (FAEs), ciclosporin and methotrexate. Network meta-analysis also showed that infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab, and brodalumab outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in reaching PASI 90. The clinical effectiveness of these drugs was similar, except for ixekizumab which had a better chance of reaching PASI 90 compared with secukinumab, guselkumab and brodalumab. The clinical effectiveness of these seven drugs was: infliximab (versus placebo): risk ratio (RR) 50.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.96 to 120.67, SUCRA = 93.6; high-certainty evidence; ixekizumab (versus placebo): RR 32.48, 95% CI 27.13 to 38.87; SUCRA = 90.5; high-certainty evidence; risankizumab (versus placebo): RR 28.76, 95% CI 23.96 to 34.54; SUCRA = 84.6; high-certainty evidence; bimekizumab (versus placebo): RR 58.64, 95% CI 3.72 to 923.86; SUCRA = 81.4; high-certainty evidence; secukinumab (versus placebo): RR 25.79, 95% CI 21.61 to 30.78; SUCRA = 76.2; high-certainty evidence; guselkumab (versus placebo): RR 25.52, 95% CI 21.25 to 30.64; SUCRA = 75; high-certainty evidence; and brodalumab (versus placebo): RR 23.55, 95% CI 19.48 to 28.48; SUCRA = 68.4; moderate-certainty evidence. Conservative interpretation is warranted for the results for bimekizumab (as well as mirikizumab, tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters, and methotrexate), as these drugs, in the NMA, have been evaluated in few trials. We found no significant difference between any of the interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAE analyses were based on a very low number of events with low to moderate certainty for all the comparisons. Thus, the results have to be viewed with caution and we cannot be sure of the ranking. For other efficacy outcomes (PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1) the results were similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for several of the interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab and brodalumab were the most effective treatments for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence. This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficient for evaluation of longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 45 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly-reported safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. We found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs, and the evidence for all the interventions was of low to moderate quality. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the treatments included in this review, it will also be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies. In terms of future research, randomised trials directly comparing active agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between non-biological systemic agents and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve participants, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the interventions and the comparative safety of different agents. Editorial note: This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available.

It may offer improved efficacy versus intravenous (IV) infliximab formulations. METHODS: A network meta-regression was conducted using individual patient data from two randomised trials in patients with RA, which compared CT-P13 SC with CT-P13 IV, and CT-P13 IV with reference infliximab IV. In this analysis, CT-P13 SC was compared with CT-P13 IV, reference infliximab IV and pooled data for both reference infliximab IV and CT-P13 IV. Outcomes included changes from baseline in 28-joint Disease Activity Score based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and rates of remission, low disease activity or clinically meaningful improvement in functional disability per Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). RESULTS: The two studies enrolled 949 patients with RA; pooled data for 840 and 751 patients were evaluable at weeks 30 and 54, respectively. For the CT-P13 SC versus pooled IV treatment arm comparison, differences in changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP (- 0.578; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.831, - 0.325; p < 0.0001), CDAI (- 3.502; 95% CI - 5.715, - 1.289; p = 0.002) and SDAI (- 4.031; 95% CI - 6.385, - 1.677; p = 0.0008) scores at 30 weeks were statistically significant in favour of CT-P13 SC. From weeks 30 to 54, the magnitude of the differences increased and remained statistically significant in favour of CT-P13 SC. Similar results were observed for the comparison of CT-P13 SC with CT-P13 IV and with reference infliximab IV. Statistically significant differences at week 30 favoured CT-P13 SC over the pooled IV treatment arms for the proportions of patients achieving EULAR-CRP good response, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 and ACR70 responses, DAS28-CRP-defined remission, low disease activity (DAS28-CRP, CDAI and SDAI criteria) and clinically meaningful HAQ-DI improvement. CONCLUSIONS: CT-P13 SC was associated with greater improvements in DAS28-CRP, CDAI and SDAI scores and higher rates of clinical response, low disease activity and clinically meaningful improvement in functional disability, compared with CT-P13 IV and reference infliximab IV.

Since 2004, the number of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS has grown substantially. As a result, patients, healthcare providers, and insurers are increasingly interested in comparative efficacy and safety evaluations to distinguish between treatment options, but head-to-head studies between DMTs are limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to compare efficacy and safety outcomes with the DMTs ozanimod and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to adjust for cross-trial differences in study design and population. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of ozanimod compared with DMF. Individual patient-level data (IPD) for ozanimod were obtained from the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B trials, and aggregate-level patient data (APD) for DMF were obtained from CONFIRM and DEFINE. A MAIC is used to weight IPD to APD based on important baseline patient characteristics considered to be effect modifiers or prognostic factors in order to balance the covariate distribution to establish more homogenous trial populations. Once trial populations are determined to be sufficiently homogenous, outcomes of interest are estimated and used to generate treatment effects between the weighted IPD and APD. We used MAIC methodology to compare efficacy and safety outcomes of interest between ozanimod 1.0 mg once daily (OD) and DMF 240 mg twice daily (BID), including confirmed disability progression (CDP) at 3 and 6 months, annualized relapse rate (ARR), proportion of patients relapsed, overall adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and discontinuations due to AEs. RESULTS: After matching patient data, baseline patient characteristics were balanced between patients receiving ozanimod and those receiving DMF. Compared with DMF, ozanimod demonstrated significantly improved CDP at 3 months (hazard ratio 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.86), ARR (rate ratio [RR] 0.80; 95% CI 0.67-0.97), proportion of patients relapsed (odds ratio [OR] 0.66; 95% CI 0.52-0.83), overall AEs (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.08-0.16), SAEs (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.19-0.39), and discontinuations (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.07-0.17). CDP at 6 months did not differ significantly between the two agents (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.62-1.26). CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment of baseline patient characteristics, the MAIC demonstrated that the efficacy and safety of ozanimod 1.0 mg OD was superior to that of DMF 240 mg BID. Although a MAIC is less likely to produce biased estimates than a naïve or a standard indirect treatment comparison via a common comparator, limitations include potential confounding due to unobserved and thus unaccounted for baseline differences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",33847901,PMC8310468

This study indirectly compared the effectiveness of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy+/-bevacizumab for previously untreated non-squamous NSCLC patients without EGFR/ALK aberrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted using individual patient data (IPD) from KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G (KN021 G) (pembrolizumab + carboplatin + pemetrexed; N = 59) and KEYNOTE-189 (KN189) (pembrolizumab + pemetrexed + platinum chemotherapy; N = 410) and published aggregate data from IMpower 130 (atezolizumab + carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel; N = 451) and IMpower 150 (atezolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab; N = 356). To adjust for cross-trial differences in baseline characteristics, data from patients randomized to pembrolizumab + chemotherapy in KN021 G/KN189 were reweighted to match the baseline characteristics of patients randomized to atezolizumab + chemotherapy from IMpower 130 or atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab from IMpower 150. Outcomes included overall survival (OS), blinded independent review-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). OS and PFS follow-up were truncated to the trial with shorter follow-up. Sensitivity analyses were conducted without truncation of follow-up of OS and PFS. RESULTS: After matching for cross-trial differences, the effective sample size of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy was 428 and 389 for the IMpower 130 and IMpower 150 comparisons, respectively. The estimated HRs (95 % CIs) of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy were 0.80 (0.67,0.95) and 0.79 (0.67,0.93) with regard to OS and PFS, respectively. For pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab, the estimated HR (95 % CIs) was 0.86 (0.72,1.03) for OS and 0.81 (0.68,0.96) for PFS. For ORR, the estimated risk ratio (95 % CI) and the risk difference (95 % CI) was 0.9 (0.8,1.1) and -3.5 % (-10.0,3.1) for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy, respectively, and 0.8 (0.7,0.9) and -12.2 % (-19.6,-4.8) for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab, respectively. Findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses for both outcomes. CONCLUSION: MAIC results showed a significantly better OS and PFS for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy compared with atezolizumab + chemotherapy and a significantly better PFS for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy compared with atezolizumab + chemotherapy + bevacizumab.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",33839603,

Lacking head-to-head trials, the optimal treatment for nmCRPC is unknown, despite widely varied treatment costs. We compared the efficacy and safety of nmCRPC treatments. METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases, regulatory documents, and trial registries for nmCRPC trials. We included published results and, when available, original data. We performed matching-adjusted indirect comparison and network meta-analysis and compared treatments regarding metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and serious adverse events. RESULTS: We analyzed 5 trials with 4360 participants. Compared with placebo, abiraterone acetate engendered the lowest hazard of metastasis and death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.22, 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.12-0.41), followed by apalutamide (HR = 0.28, 95% CrI = 0.23-0.34), enzalutamide (HR = 0.30, 95% CrI = 0.25-0.36), and darolutamide (HR = 0.41, 95% CrI = 0.34-0.49); darolutamide led to the lowest hazard of death (HR = 0.69, 95% CrI = 0.53-0.90), followed by enzalutamide (HR = 0.73, 95% CrI = 0.61-0.87) and apalutamide (HR = 0.75, 95% CrI = 0.59-0.95); darolutamide resulted in the lowest odds of serious adverse events (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95% CrI = 1.02-1.70), followed by enzalutamide (OR =1.43, 95% CrI = 1.08-1.89), apalutamide (OR = 1.58, 95% CrI = 1.23-2.03), and abiraterone acetate (OR = 1.94, 95% CrI = 1.17-3.22). CONCLUSIONS: For nmCRPC, darolutamide offered optimal efficacy and safety among approved drugs, and abiraterone acetate may offer comparable metastasis-free survival benefit with cost savings from generic availability.

This matching-adjusted indirect comparison evaluated the efficacy and safety of both drugs after sorafenib in patients with HCC and AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. METHODS: Individual patient data (IPD) from the CELESTIAL trial (cabozantinib) and population-level data from the REACH-2 trial (ramucirumab) were used. To align with REACH-2, the CELESTIAL population was limited to patients who received first-line sorafenib only and had baseline serum AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. The IPD from CELESTIAL were weighted to balance the distribution of 11 effect-modifying baseline characteristics with those of REACH-2. Overall survival (OS; primary endpoint) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared for the CELESTIAL (matching-adjusted) and REACH-2 populations using weighted Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and parametric (OS, Weibull; PFS, log-logistic) modeling. Rates of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and TRAE-related discontinuations were also compared. RESULTS: After matching and weighting, baseline characteristics were balanced between populations (REACH-2, N = 292; CELESTIAL, effective sample size = 105). Weighted KM estimates for OS (median [95% CI]) were not significantly different between cabozantinib and ramucirumab (10.6 [9.5-17.3] months versus 8.7 [7.3-10.8] months; p = 0.104), but PFS was significantly longer for cabozantinib than for ramucirumab (5.5 [4.6-7.4] months versus 2.8 [2.7-4.1] months; p = 0.016). Parametric modeling results were consistent with the weighted KM analysis. Rates of some grade 3 or 4 TRAEs were lower with ramucirumab than with cabozantinib; however, TRAE-related discontinuation rates were similar (p = 0.271). CONCLUSION: In this MAIC, cabozantinib significantly prolonged median PFS compared with ramucirumab after prior sorafenib treatment in patients with HCC and AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL; rates of some grade 3 or 4 TRAEs were lower with ramucirumab than cabozantinib but related discontinuation rates were not significantly different between treatments.

This study compares prespecified adverse events and metastasis-free survival associated with darolutamide vs apalutamide, and darolutamide vs enzalutamide, via matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individual patient data from the phase III ARAMIS trial (N(PLACEBO)=553; N(DAROLUTAMIDE)=943) were selected and reweighted to match the inclusion criteria and baseline characteristics published for the phase III SPARTAN (N(PLACEBO)=401; N(APALUTAMIDE)=806) and PROSPER (N(PLACEBO)=468; N(ENZALUTAMIDE)=933) trials. Only baseline factors consistently reported across trials were included as matching covariates. Both indirect comparisons matched on age, prostate specific antigen level and doubling time, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Gleason score, and bone-sparing agent use. Darolutamide vs apalutamide also matched on prior surgery and darolutamide vs enzalutamide also matched on region. Risk differences and odds ratios were calculated for adverse events and hazard ratios for metastasis-free survival. RESULTS: No differences in metastasis-free survival hazard ratios were found after matching in either comparison. However, fall, fracture and rash rates were statistically significantly lower in favor of darolutamide vs apalutamide. Fall, dizziness, mental impairment, fatigue and severe fatigue rates were statistically significantly lower in favor of darolutamide vs enzalutamide. CONCLUSIONS: While metastasis-free survival did not differ across drugs in these cross-trial indirect comparisons, darolutamide showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in prespecified adverse events vs apalutamide and enzalutamide. Consideration of these adverse events is important in clinical decision-making and treatment selection in nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",33818140,

METHODS: We conducted an analysis using a Markov cohort model with a cycle length of 1 year, life-long time horizon, and discount rate of 3% for cost and health outcomes. We used a matching-adjusted indirect comparison to estimate clinical outcomes using data from the EXPAND randomised controlled trial of siponimod vs placebo and the Nordic SPMS randomised controlled trial of interferon beta-1a vs placebo as the basis for estimates of disability progression and relapse outcomes. We used 6-month confirmed disability progression results to estimate disability progression in the base-case analysis. We calculated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on an external study that administered the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire to European patients with multiple sclerosis. We included costs (Swiss Franc (CHF), year 2020) of drug acquisition/administration, adverse events and disease management. We also performed a budget impact analysis to estimate the cost over the first 3 years of introducing siponimod. RESULTS: For the base case, siponimod resulted in mean incremental costs of CHF 84,901 (siponimod: CHF 567,838, interferon beta-1a: CHF 482,937) and mean incremental QALYs of 1.591 (siponimod: 7.495, interferon beta-1a: 5.905), leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 53,364 per QALY gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of the cost effectiveness of siponimod assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 100,000 per QALY gained was 90%. Siponimod was projected to result in drug administration costs for siponimod of CHF 23,817,856 in the first 3 years after introduction, accompanied by large cost offsets in drug acquisition of other multiple sclerosis drugs. Considering drug administration, monitoring and adverse event management costs, it was estimated to result in additional healthcare costs in Switzerland of CHF 2,177,021. CONCLUSIONS: In the base-case analysis, we found that siponimod may be cost effective for treating Swiss adult patients with SPMS with active disease. The results of the cost-effectiveness analyses are valid under the assumption that the efficacy of siponimod and the comparators on disability progression for the overall SPMS population would be the same in the active SPMS population.

Tisagenlecleucel is a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy with promising efficacy and manageable safety that was approved in Japan in 2019 for the treatment of CD19-positive r/r B cell ALL (B-ALL). However, there is no publication assessing the cost-effectiveness of CAR-T in Japan. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a tisagenlecleucel treatment strategy compared to a blinatumomab treatment strategy and a clofarabine combination treatment strategy (i.e., clofarabine + cyclophosphamide + etoposide) in Japan for pediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with r/r B-ALL. A partitioned survival model with a lifetime horizon and monthly cycle was constructed from a Japanese public healthcare payer's perspective. Patients were distributed across the following partitioned health states: event-free survival (EFS), progressive disease, and death, which were informed by the EFS and overall survival (OS) data of respective clinical trials before year 5. For the tisagenlecleucel arm, a decision-tree structure was used to partition patients based on the infusion status; those who discontinued prior to receiving infusion were assigned efficacy and cost inputs of blinatumomab and those who received infusion were assigned efficacy and costs inputs based on tisagenlecleucel-infused patients. As trial data for blinatumomab and clofarabine ended before year 5, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were used to extrapolate OS between the end of trial observation and up to year 5. All surviving patients followed the mortality risk of long-term ALL survivors without additional risk of disease relapse after year 5, regardless of initial treatment strategies. The model accounted for pretreatment costs, treatment costs, adverse event costs, follow-up costs, subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation costs, and terminal care costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per life-years (LYs) gained and ICERs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were evaluated using a 2% discount rate, and a threshold of ¥7.5 million was used to assess cost-effectiveness. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The total LYs (discounted) for tisagenlecleucel, blinatumomab, and clofarabine combination treatment strategies were 13.3, 4.0, and 2.7 years, respectively; the corresponding QALYs were 11.6, 3.1, and 2.1 years, respectively. The ICERs per QALY gained for tisagenlecleucel were ¥2,035,071 versus blinatumomab and ¥2,644,702 versus clofarabine combination therapy. Extensive sensitivity analyses supported the findings. Tisagenlecleucel is a cost-effective treatment strategy for pediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-ALL from a Japanese public healthcare payer's perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics,FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: result_not_described",33781519,

Inadequate response to steroid therapy for aGVHD is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality, including among pediatric patients, who are the focus of this study. Ruxolitinib and remestemcel-L-rknd were evaluated for the treatment of steroid-refractory (SR) aGVHD in two separate single-arm trials. To effectively compare the safety and efficacy of these treatments without a head-to-head trial, a simulated treatment comparison (STC) was conducted. Methods: Regression techniques were used to adjust individual patient-level data from the remestemcel-L-rknd trial to mutually reported baseline characteristics from the ruxolitinib trial. Outcomes of interest included a 28-day overall response rate (ORR), a 28-day ORR in the grade III-IV aGVHD population, and adverse events (AEs). Results: In the full populations, the STC of risk ratios (RRs) found treatment with remestemcel-L-rknd to be associated with a numerical but not statistically significant improvement in the 28-day ORR versus ruxolitinib. In the grade III-IV aGVHD sub-group, the STC showed significantly improved 28-day ORR for remestemcel-L-rknd versus ruxolitinib (P=0.04). Remestemcel-L-rknd was also associated with improved safety outcomes (P<0.05) in 17 out of 30 AEs, including hematologic events, peripheral edema, muscular weakness, nausea, back pain, and fatigue. Conclusion: Remestemcel-L-rknd was associated with significant improvements in day 28 ORR compared with ruxolitinib in patients with severe (grade III-IV) SR aGVHD. Across all grades of SR aGVHD, remestemcel-L-rknd was associated with fewer all-grade treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (27/30) available for comparison, including the majority reaching statistical significance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",33768123,PMC7983491

METHODS AND RESULTS: Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating SGLT2i or ARNI in HFrEF. And a total of six trials were included. SGLT2i was found to significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure by 27% [hazard ratio (HR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.80], hospitalization for heart failure by 31% (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62-0.77), cardiovascular death by 16% (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.95), and all-cause death by 16% (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.94) in HFrEF only with a statistically higher risk of genital infection (risk ratio (RR) 2.78, 95% CI 1.46-5.29). The reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure was of similar magnitude in patients with or without diabetes mellitus (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.80 vs. HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.87) using SGLT2i. Indirect treatment comparison showed that SGLT2i and ARNI had similar effects on primary outcome (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82-1.06). And combination of SGLT2i and ARNI achieved a better prognosis performance (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.89) compared with ARNI monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2i could safely reduce cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in HFrEF regardless of diabetes mellitus status. SGLT2i and ARNI demonstrate similar effects, while combination of SGLT2i and ARNI results in a better cardiovascular protective effect.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33749159,PMC8120387

We report here a MAIC of second-line MKI options for patients with HCC previously treated with sorafenib using individual real-world data of regorafenib and aggregate data of second-line cabozantinib from the CELESTIAL trial. METHODS: Data from 278 patients who received regorafenib as second-line therapy after sorafenib failure for unresectable HCC were used as IPD. Data inclusion were adapted to those reported in the CELESTIAL trial in the subset of patients who received sorafenib as the only prior therapy. Survival medians and rates were obtained from Kaplan-Meier curves, and differences between regorafenib and cabozantinib groups were explored through Cox regression adjusted for weights originating from MAIC. RESULTS: The median OS of the weighted regorafenib group was 11.1 months (IQR: 5.6-16.4) and 11.3 (IQR: 6.7-22.4) for cabozantinib; HR 0.83 (95%CI 0.62-1.09). The median PFS of the weighted regorafenib group was 3.0 months (IQR: 1.9-4.8) and 5.5 (IQR: 2.3-9.3) for cabozantinib; HR 0.50 (95%CI 0.41-0.62). In the subgroup who received prior sorafenib for < 3 months, the median OS of the regorafenib group was 6.5 months (IQR: 4.7-10.9) and 9.5 months (IQR: 5.9-18.2) for cabozantinib; HR 0.68 (95%CI 0.39-1.16). In the subgroup receiving prior sorafenib for 3 to < 6 months, the median OS of the regorafenib group was 8.0 months (IQR: 4.2-15.2) and 11.5 (IQR: 6.5-23.9) for cabozantinib; HR 0.66 (95%CI 0.42-1.02). In the subgroup receiving prior sorafenib for ≥ 6 months, the median OS of the regorafenib group was 13.4 (IQR: 8.1-46.5) and 12.3 (IQR: 6.6-22.9) for cabozantinib; HR 0.89 (95%CI 0.52-1.51). CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed no differences between regorafenib and cabozantinib in terms of OS. However, in earlier progressors on prior sorafenib a larger benefit might be expected from cabozantinib treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",33745079,

In the absence of head-to-head comparisons between second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the objective of this study was to indirectly compare the efficacy of bosutinib with nilotinib and dasatinib in first-line (1L) CP-CML. METHODS: Cross-trial heterogeneity in terms of patient baseline characteristics and imatinib dose escalation are difficult to adjust for in network meta-analyses and anchored matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (MAICs). Therefore, an unanchored MAIC was performed using patient level data from bosutinib (BFORE trial) and published aggregated data from nilotinib (ENESTnd) and dasatinib (DASISION) trials. After matching, cytogenetic and molecular responses, and disease progression, after a minimum follow-up of 24 months were compared between nilotinib versus bosutinb and dasatinib versus bosutinib. RESULTS: The comparison of nilotinib versus bosutinib resulted in no statistically significant differences for MMR at and by 24 months, MR4 by 24 months, MR4.5 at and by 24 months, CCyR by 24 months, and disease progression, however, a decreased odds of MR4 at 24 months in favor of bosutinib versus nilotinib was observed. The comparison of dasatinib versus bosutinib by 24 months resulted in no statistically significant differences for MMR, disease progression, and CCyR, however a decreased odds of MR4.5 in favor of bosutinib versus dasatinib was observed.

These comparisons are of particular interest in the areas of oncology and hematology where uncertainty in decision-making on the inclusion of new drugs is frequently accentuated by both the severity of the disease and the high cost of treatment. The objective of this study was to describe how Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison methodology has been used to date in the assessment of hematological cancer drugs by international agencies. METHOD: Between January 2015 and October 2019, an exhaustive search was conducted of the websites of European National Agencies that provided public information on the assessment process. The assessments provided by these agencies were reviewed to obtain a list of hematological cancer drugs for which the presentation of a Matched-Adjusted Indirect Comparison was recorded. For this list of drugs, the role of the comparison in the assessment process was analyzed for each selected agency. RESULTS: Thirteen hematological and oncological treatments were found in which the pharmaceutical marketing authorization holder had presented Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparisons: most of this information referred to the first half of 2018. Acceptance of this methodology diverges among agencies, ranging from 50% in the case of the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, to 40% in the case of French National Authority for Health, to not having been taken into account in any of the 3 cases assessed by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care.

METHODS: A three-state (i.e. pre-progression, post-progression, and death) partitioned survival model was used to estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs for patients on each treatment over a lifetime horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were based on a matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) that accounted for differences in trial population baseline characteristics. Mixture cure models (MCMs) were used to account for long-term survivors. Costs included drug acquisition and administration for the CAR T-cell therapies and conditioning chemotherapy, apheresis, CAR T-specific monitoring, transplant, hospitalization, adverse events, routine care, and terminal care. Health state utilities were derived from trial and published data. Sensitivity analyses included probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) and an analysis of extremes that assessed the results across a vast array of combinations of parametric OS and PFS curves across the two therapies. RESULTS: Compared to tisa-cel, axi-cel resulted in 2.31 QALYs gained and a cost reduction of $1,407 in the base case. In the PSA, the cost per QALY gained was ≤$31,500 in 95% of the 1,000 simulations. In the analysis of extremes, the cost per QALY gained was ≤$7,500 in 99% of the 1,296 combinations of MCMs and ≤$40,000 in 95% of the 1,296 combinations of standard models. LIMITATIONS: In absence of head-to-head comparative data, we relied on a MAIC, which cannot account for all possible confounders. Moreover, some outcomes (i.e. transplantations, hospitalizations, adverse events (AEs)) were not adjusted in the MAIC. CONCLUSIONS: In this simulation, axi-cel was a superior treatment option as it is predicted to achieve better outcomes at lower or minimal incremental costs versus tisa-cel.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics,FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: result_not_described",33691581,

The aim of present study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of empagliflozin compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment of patients with T2DM and established CVD in Greece. METHODS: A published health economic model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes of T2DM patients receiving empagliflozin compared to those receiving dapagliflozin. Individual patient-level discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict time-to-event for CV, renal, and adverse events over patients' lifetimes. Hazard ratios for dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on each clinical event was estimated from DECLARE-TIMI 58 and EMPA-REG OUTCOME trials' data using an indirect treatment comparison. Following a public payer perspective, only direct medical costs related to drug acquisition, fatal/non-fatal diabetes-related complications and adverse events were considered (€2020). Model extrapolated outcomes included life years (LY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of changes in input data. RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, empagliflozin was associated with longer mean survival (17.23 LY with empagliflozin vs 16.07 LY with dapagliflozin) and reduced rate of CV mortality resulting in 0.48 more QALYs (9.27 vs 8.79), at additional costs of €462. The generated ICER of empagliflozin was €965 per QALY gained. Deterministic sensitivity analysis confirmed empagliflozin's cost-effective profile. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of empagliflozin being cost effective over dapagliflozin was 100%, at the defined threshold of €36,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin was estimated to be a highly cost-effective treatment option compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment of T2DM patients with established CVD in Greece.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics,FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33687695,

Unfortunately, evidence of real world effectiveness for new interventions is not available at the time of initial approval. To bridge this gap, statistical methods are available to extend the estimated treatment effect observed in a RCT to a target population. The generalization is done by weighting the subjects who participated in a RCT so that the weighted trial population resembles a target population. We evaluate a variety of alternative estimation and weight construction procedures using both simulations and a real world data example using two clinical trials of an investigational intervention for Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest an optimal approach to estimation depends on the characteristics of source and target populations, including degree of selection bias and treatment effect heterogeneity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic,methodological",33675139,PMC8359356

This study aimed to develop a real-world response (rwR) variable applicable to solid tumors and to evaluate its clinical relevance and meaningfulness. METHODS: This retrospective study used patient cohorts with advanced non-small cell lung cancer from a nationwide, de-identified electronic health record (EHR)-derived database. Disease burden information abstracted manually was classified into response categories anchored to discrete therapy lines (per patient-line). In part 1, we quantified the feasibility and reliability of data capture, and estimated the association between rwR status and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and real-world overall survival (rwOS). In part 2, we investigated the correlation between published clinical trial overall response rates (ORRs) and real-world response rates (rwRRs) from corresponding real-world patient cohorts. RESULTS: In part 1, 85.4% of patients (N = 3248) had  at least one radiographic assessment documented. Median abstraction time per patient-line was 15.0 min (IQR 7.8-28.1). Inter-abstractor agreement on presence/absence of at least one assessment was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96; n = 503 patient-lines abstracted in duplicate); inter-abstractor agreement on best confirmed response category was 0.82 (95% CI 0.78-0.86; n = 384 with at least one captured assessment). Confirmed responders at a 3-month landmark showed significantly lower risk of death and progression in rwOS and rwPFS analyses across all line settings. In part 2, rwRRs (from 12 rw cohorts) showed a high correlation with trial ORRs (Spearman's ρ = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a rwR variable generated from clinician assessments documented in EHRs following radiographic evaluations. This variable provides clinically meaningful information and may provide a real-world measure of treatment effectiveness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",33674928,PMC8004504

Recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) and emicizumab, a humanized, bispecific antibody, are approved for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in severe hemophilia A. These products have different mechanisms of action, methods of administration and treatment schedules. In the absence of head-to-head trials, indirect treatment comparisons can provide informative evidence on the relative efficacy of the two treatments. The aim of the study was to compare the approved dosing regimens for each product, rFVIIIFc individualized prophylaxis and emicizumab administered once every week (Q1W), every 2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W), based on clinical trial evidence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The comparison was conducted using matching-adjusted indirect comparison since clinical evidence did not form a connected network. Individual patient data for rFVIIIFc (A-LONG) were compared with data for emicizumab (HAVEN trial program) for mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and proportion of patients with zero bleeds. Safety data reported across the analyzed treatment arms were tabularized but not formally compared. RESULTS: After matching, no significant differences were observed between mean ABR for rFVIIIFc and emicizumab administered Q1W, Q2W or Q4W. The proportion of patients with zero bleeds was significantly higher with rFVIIIFc compared with emicizumab administered Q4W (51.2% versus 29.3%, respectively; odds ratio 2.53; 95% confidence interval 1.09-5.89); no significant differences noted when rFVIIIFc was compared with emicizumab administered Q1W or Q2W. The mean number of adverse events expressed per participant was 1.9 for individualized prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc and 3.7-4.0, 4.1 and 3.6 for emicizumab administered Q1W, Q2W or Q4W, respectively. CONCLUSION: This indirect treatment comparison suggests that rFVIIIFc individualized prophylaxis is more efficacious than emicizumab Q4W, and at least as effective as more frequent emicizumab regimens, for the management of hemophilia A.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",33664606,PMC7921628

HAE attacks recur with unpredictable severity and frequency throughout patients' lives; long-term prophylaxis is essential for some patients. In the absence of head-to-head studies, indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of long-term prophylactic agents is a valid approach to evaluate comparative efficacy. METHODS: We conducted an ITC using data from the placebo-controlled HELP study (assessing patients receiving lanadelumab 300 mg every 2 or 4 weeks) and the 12-week, parallel arm, crossover CHANGE study (assessing intravenous C1-INH). Outcomes of interest were attack rate ratio (ARR) and time to attack after day 0 (TTA0) and after day 70 (TTA70). Two ITC methodologies were used: a Bayesian approach using study results to update non-informative prior distributions to posterior distributions on relative treatment effects, and a frequentist approach using patient-level data from HELP and CHANGE to generate Poisson regressions (for ARR) and Cox models (for TTA0 and TT70). RESULTS: Both Bayesian and frequentist analyses suggested that lanadelumab reduced HAE attack rate by 46-73% versus intravenous C1-INH. Relative to intravenous C1-INH, risk of first attack after day 0 was comparable between intravenous C1-INH and both lanadelumab doses; risk of first attack after day 70 was reduced by 81-83% with lanadelumab 300 mg every 2 weeks, compared with C1-INH. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from these two ITC methodologies support the favorable efficacy of lanadelumab in reducing the HAE attack rate and extending attack-free intervals in patients with HAE.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33646565,PMC7937585

Complete resolution of NP at week 24‒26 is an unambiguous nail outcome accessible for indirect treatment comparison of biologics. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative efficacy of approved biologics in achieving complete resolution of NP at week 24‒26. METHODS: A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to indirectly compare the efficacy of six biologics in achieving complete resolution of NP at week 24‒26 in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and concomitant NP. Complete resolution of NP was defined as a score of zero on the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), modified NAPSI (mNAPSI) or Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernails (PGA-F). RESULTS: The probability of achieving complete resolution of NP was highest for ixekizumab (46.5%; 95% credibility interval [CrI] 35.1‒58.0; Surface Under the Cumulative RAnking curve [SUCRA] 97%), followed by brodalumab (37.0%; 17.0‒61.0; 79%), adalimumab (28.3%; 24.4‒32.4; 62%), guselkumab (27.7%; 21.1‒35.1; 58%), ustekinumab (20.8%; 10.2‒35.2; 37%), and infliximab (0.8%; 0.0‒8.9; 17%). CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and concomitant NP, ixekizumab has the greatest likelihood among approved biologics of achieving complete resolution of NP at week 24‒26.

This analysis of phase 2 data quantified the benefit and risk of zuranolone (30mg) versus placebo and antidepressants in terms of number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH). METHODS: Rates of response, remission, and all-cause discontinuation for zuranolone and 11 antidepressant comparators were obtained from the zuranolone phase 2 clinical study (N=89) and a published network meta-analysis, respectively. An indirect treatment comparison was conducted using the Bucher method to compare zuranolone to standard-of-care. RESULTS: Zuranolone demonstrated greater benefit compared to placebo on Day 3 (NNT range for response=4-5, NNT for remission=10) and at Day 15 (NNT=3 for response and remission). Compared to SSRIs and SNRIs, zuranolone at Day 15 showed improved treatment response (NNT=4 [95% CI = 3; 16] and 5 [95% CI = 3; 25], respectively) and remission (NNT=4 [95% CI = 2; 13] and 4 [95% CI = 2; 18], respectively). This was accompanied by a reduction in all-cause discontinuation, with negative NNH values (-57 and -28), respectively. LIMITATIONS: Variations in study design across the included trials may limit the generalizability of results. CONCLUSIONS: With a small positive NNT as early as Day 3 indicating robust benefit and a negative NNH indicating reduced harm, this analysis based on a phase 2 study suggests that patients with MDD may benefit from the benefit-to-risk profile of zuranolone.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33640861,

It would therefore be useful to compare the efficacy of lenvatinib and that of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab to determine if a benefit of one therapy against the other exists. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present report was to apply a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to individual participant data (IPD) from patients treated with lenvatinib outside of randomized trials, to aggregate results derived from the IMbrave150 trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 455 patients who received lenvatinib as first-line systemic therapy for unresectable HCC represented the present IPD. Data inclusion were adapted to those reported in the IMbrave150 trial. RESULTS: Overall survival on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab proved to be superior to lenvatinib (log-rank: 0.001) with a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% confidence interval 0.46-0.75). The number needed to treat ranged between seven in the first 12 months and five at the 15th month. CONCLUSIONS: The present MAIC highlights that the combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is superior to lenvatinib. However, updated data or sub-analyses of the IMbrave150 trial would provide more robust estimates for such a treatment comparison.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: observational",33638735,

About 3-5% of patients develop advanced CSCC (aCSCC) and are no longer responsive to surgery or radiation therapy. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of cemiplimab, the first systemic therapy approved in Italy for patients with aCSCC, vs platinum-based chemotherapy from the Italian National Health Service (SSN) perspective. METHODS: A partitioned survival model, which included three mutually exclusive health states, was developed to estimate costs and outcomes for patients with aCSCC, over a 30-year time horizon (lifetime). No direct evidence of the comparative efficacy and safety of cemiplimab versus other therapies currently exists. Therefore, a simulated treatment comparison (STC) was conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of cemiplimab versus chemotherapy. Individual patient data for cemiplimab were collected from the EMPOWER-CSCC 1 trial whereas chemotherapy data were derived from a retrospective study. In the STC a regression model was used to predict outcomes for cemiplimab in the population observed in the comparator study. Costs of drug acquisition/administration and management of adverse events were included. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) were calculated; sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: In the base-case, treatment with cemiplimab was associated with a gain of 4.89 LYs and 3.99 QALYs, compared with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, resulting in an estimated ICER of 27,821 €/LY gained and an ICUR of 34,110 €/QALY gained. Both ICER and ICUR were below the commonly used Italian SSN willingness to pay thresholds. CONCLUSION: The use of cemiplimab, compared with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, can be considered a cost-effective option for the treatment of aCSCC patients in Italy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics",33603419,PMC7882423

This systematic review and network meta-analysis examined efficacy and safety of biologics and tofacitinib for moderate-to-severe UC, using vedolizumab as reference.Methods: Relevant studies (N = 19) of vedolizumab, adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, ustekinumab, and tofacitinib were identified. Study design differences were addressed by assessing efficacy outcomes conditional on response at maintenance initiation. Primary analysis used fixed-effect models to estimate odds ratios for efficacy and safety endpoints.Results: Compared with vedolizumab 300 mg, adalimumab 160/80 mg was associated with less clinical remission (odds ratio, 0.69 [95% credible interval, 0.54-0.88]), and infliximab 5 mg/kg was associated with more clinical remission (1.67 [1.16-2.42]) and response (1.63 [1.15-2.30]). Adalimumab 40 mg, golimumab 50 mg, and ustekinumab 90 mg Q12W had significantly lower clinical remission rates during maintenance (0.62 [0.45-0.86], 0.55 [0.32-0.95], and 0.59 [0.35-0.99]) versus vedolizumab 300 mg Q8W.

It is critical for researchers conducting comparative effectiveness research (CER) to carefully consider the most appropriate data sources and comparable patient populations. The aim of this study was to identify potential data sources and populations for comparing to single-arm CAR-T trials CARTITUDE-1 (cilta-cel) and KarMMa (ide-cel). METHODS: A 2-part global systematic literature search produced a review of (1) clinical trials of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline preferred regimens in previously treated MM, and (2) real-world data cohorts of TCE or TCR populations, published between 1/1/2015 and 12/10/2020, with sample sizes of > 50 patients and reporting survival-related outcomes. Implications on CER and accepted best practices are discussed. RESULTS: Nine clinical trials of NCCN preferred regimens were identified along with five real-world data-based publications. No clinical trials evaluated patients with TCE or TCR MM. Among the real-world data-based publications, two evaluated patients exclusively with TCR MM, two analyzed a mixed population of patients with TCE or TCR MM, and one publication assessed patients exclusively with TCE MM. Real-world data treatment patterns were heterogeneous. CONCLUSION: Current NCCN preferred regimens were not specifically studied in TCE or TCR MM patients, although some studies do include a proportion of these types of patients. Therefore, appropriate matching of populations using either real-world data or patient level clinical trial data is critical to putting trials of novel CAR-Ts (i.e., CARTITUDE-1 or KarMMa) into appropriate comparative context.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",33598857,

Results from prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing these treatments have not yet been reported. This analysis evaluated the relative efficacy and safety of NIVO+IPI versus DAB+TRAM, ENCO+BINI, and VEM+COBI in patients with BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review identified RCTs for DAB+TRAM, ENCO+BINI, and VEM+COBI in patients with BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma. Individual patient-level data for NIVO+IPI were derived from the phase III CheckMate 067 trial (BRAF-mutant cohort) and restricted to match the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the comparator trials. Treatment effects for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards and time-varying hazard ratio (HR) models. Safety outcomes (grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events) with NIVO+IPI and the comparators were compared. RESULTS: In the Cox proportional hazards analysis, NIVO+IPI showed improved OS compared with DAB+TRAM (HR = 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.73), ENCO+BINI (HR = 0.60; CI, 0.42-0.85), and VEM+COBI (HR = 0.50; CI, 0.36-0.70) for the overall study period. In the time-varying analysis, NIVO+IPI was associated with significant improvements in OS and PFS compared with the BRAF/MEK inhibitors 12 months after treatment initiation. There were no significant differences between NIVO+IPI and BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment from 0 to 12 months. Safety outcomes favored DAB+TRAM over NIVO+IPI, whereas NIVO+IPI was comparable to VEM+COBI.

However, no head-to-head RCTs exist between biologics. OBJECTIVE: To perform an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of the efficacy of biologics plus INCS versus placebo (INCS) as a common comparator. METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane were searched for RCTs of biologics in CRSwNP. Bucher ITCs were performed for outcomes at week 24: nasal polyp score (NPS) (range, 0-8), nasal congestion (NC) (range, 0-3), loss of smell (range, 0-3), University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (range, 0-40), total symptom score (range, 0-12), 22-item sinonasal outcome test (range, 0-110), and responder analyses based on NPS or NC improvement of 1 point or greater. RESULTS: Assessment of trial design, baseline characteristics, and outcome measures suggested that ITC was feasible with four phase 3 RCTs: dupilumab SINUS-24 and SINUS-52 (NCT02912468/NCT02898454) and omalizumab POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 (NCT03280550/NCT03280537).

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is available as a natural product (repository corticotropin injection, [RCI]; Acthar® Gel) and as synthetic analogs. RCI is a naturally-sourced complex mixture of purified ACTH analogs and other pituitary peptides approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms. RCI is commonly used in the United States. Outside the United States, synthetic analogs of ACTH-synthetic ACTH1-24 (tetracosactide) and synthetic ACTH1-39 (corticotropin carboxymethyl-cellulose [CCMC])-are used. The efficacy of RCI may differ from that of synthetic ACTH treatments based on the structure of peptide; however, no head-to-head clinical trials have compared the efficacy of RCI and synthetic ACTH treatments. Objective: A systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of clinical trials was conducted to assess the comparative efficacy of RCI and synthetic ACTH treatments in infantile spasms. Methods: A search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases through September 30, 2020. Relevant clinical trials on RCI or synthetic ACTH therapy and reporting either cessation of spasms or resolution of hypsarrhythmia, separately or as a combined outcome were included. A Bayesian indirect treatment comparison using a fixed-effects model was used for comparative efficacy. Results: Of 473 citations screened, 21 studies were reviewed qualitatively. In the indirect treatment comparison of six eligible clinical trial studies, the odds of achieving efficacy outcomes were five to eight times greater with RCI than with tetracosactide and 14 to 16 times greater than CCMC. This translated to a risk reduction of 10% to 14% and 40% to 50% with RCI versus tetracosactide and CCMC, respectively. For every two to five patients treated, RCI improved efficacy outcomes in one additional patient compared to synthetic ACTH (adjusted number needed-to-treat). Conclusions: Based on the available limited evidence, results suggest RCI may be more efficacious for infantile spasms than synthetic ACTH treatments. Our findings provide a blueprint to inform the design of future prospective studies for the treatment of infantile spasms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33521161,PMC7839629

METHODS: A systematic search of databases was performed to identify trials comparing WAVE or PUL to either an active or sham surgery control in subjects with symptomatic benign prostatic obstruction. A controlled indirect treatment comparison based on the approach of Bucher was performed for outcomes including International Prostate Symptom Score and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). The durability of treatment response was assessed by life-table analysis of freedom from retreatment through 4 years. RESULTS: Two multicenter sham-controlled trials (Rezum II Study, NCT01912339: LIFT Study, NCT01294150) were identified. The trials employed a common sham procedure and were similar with respect to their designs and subjects' baseline characteristics. Comparisons on the treatment effect in excess of sham response found non-significant differences between WAVE and PUL for symptom score [mean difference (MD): - 1.7 points; 95% confidence interval (CI): - 4.8, 1.4] but Qmax improvements favored WAVE [MD: 3.4 ml/sec; CI: 1.2, 5.6]. The proportion free of retreatment through 4 years was 89.1% for WAVE versus 75.4% for PUL [log-rank P = 0.004]. CONCLUSIONS: PUL and WAVE provide similar subjective improvements but flow-rate improvement and durability of response seem greater for WAVE. The confirmation of these findings in a randomized trial is warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33515055,

Matching-adjusted peginterferon beta-1a patients (effective n = 276) demonstrated a similar ARR at 1 year (0.278 versus 0.318; p = 0.375) and significantly lower ARR at 2 years (0.0901 versus 0.203; p = 0.032) and 3 years (0.109 versus 0.209; p = 0.047) compared with GA 40 mg/ml TIW patients (n = 834). CONCLUSION: Results from separate matching comparisons of phase III clinical trials and extension studies suggest that peginterferon beta-1a 125 mcg Q2W may provide better clinical outcomes than GA (20 mg/ml QD or 40 mg/ml TIW).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read,FULL_ARTICLE | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""MAIC as secondary analysis""]}",33488773,PMC7809527

Several recent clinical studies have investigated the feasibility of inhaled ciprofloxacin in NCFB, whereas the results were controversial. AIM: No antibiotic therapies have been approved for reducing exacerbations and preventing disease progression in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) patients. Several recent clinical studies have investigated the feasibility of inhaled ciprofloxacin in NCFB, whereas the results were controversial. We conducted the present meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of inhalation of ciprofloxacin in NCFB. METHODS: Electrical databases Medline and Cochrane library were retrieved from inception through December 2019. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing inhaled ciprofloxacin and placebo were selected. The primary outcomes were time to first exacerbation, frequency of exacerbations and the change in sputum Pseudomonas aeruginosa density. RESULTS: A total of five articles involving six RCT was finally included in the analysis. The time to first exacerbation was significantly prolonged by inhaled ciprofloxacin (hazard ratio: 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.82), with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 23%). Inhalation of ciprofloxacin significantly reduced frequency of exacerbations (risk ratio: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.61-0.79) and decreased density of sputum P. aeruginosa (weighted mean difference: -2.11 log(10) CFU/g, 95% CI: -2.96 to -1.27 log(10) CFU/g) compared with placebo. No significant between-group differences in mortality, adverse events and discontinuation rate were observed. Further indirect treatment comparison showed no differences between the two types of inhaled ciprofloxacin in all outcomes of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin inhalation treatment significantly prolonged the time to first exacerbation, reduced the frequency of exacerbations and decreased sputum P. aeruginosa density and was well tolerated. Ciprofloxacin inhalation is promising in the treatment of NCFB.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33469994,

This study aims to evaluate its cost-effectiveness versus LDAC alone and azacitidine from a Canadian payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned-survival model was developed with three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), relapse/progression and death. Clinical inputs were obtained from the BRIGHT AML 1003 study for glasdegib and LDAC, and from the two trial publications and indirect treatment comparison for azacitidine. Drug acquisition/administration, disease management, adverse event and end-of-life costs were considered. All costs were measured in Canadian dollars. Cost-effectiveness of glasdegib + LDAC was assessed against LDAC alone in main population, and against azacitidine by bone marrow blasts (BMB). A weighted average ICER was calculated to represent the current treatment use of Canadian clinical practice. The reference-case analysis was conducted probabilistically, and numerous probabilistic scenario analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared to LDAC alone was CAD $177,065 (a mean gain of 0.41 QALYs and an incremental cost of CAD $72,695), to azacitidine in 20-30% and >30% BMB group were CAD $178,201 (a mean gain of 0.34 QALYs and an incremental cost of CAD $59,889) and dominant (a mean gain of 0.28 QALYs while reducing costs by CAD $7,856) respectively, resulting in a weighted average ICER of CAD $81,310 per QALY. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Though uncertainties remain with the generated PFS curve, the derived azacitidine curves, administration and vial wastage, the model has been built under the best available evidence and relied on clinical opinions where there were data gaps. The weighted average ICER suggests that glasdegib + LDAC is cost-effective at a CAD $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33461352,

However, comparisons between disconnected treatments are not possible without making strong assumptions. When studies including multiple doses of the same drug are available, model-based NMA (MBNMA) presents a novel solution to this problem by modeling a parametric dose-response relationship within an NMA framework. In this article, we illustrate several scenarios in which dose-response MBNMA can connect and strengthen evidence networks. METHODS: We created illustrative data sets by removing studies or treatments from an NMA of triptans for migraine relief. We fitted MBNMA models with different dose-response relationships. For connected networks, we compared MBNMA estimates with NMA estimates. For disconnected networks, we compared MBNMA estimates with NMA estimates from an ""augmented"" network connected by adding studies or treatments back into the data set. RESULTS: In connected networks, relative effect estimates from MBNMA were more precise than those from NMA models (ratio of posterior SDs NMA v. MBNMA: median = 1.13; range = 1.04-1.68). In disconnected networks, MBNMA provided estimates for all treatments where NMA could not and were consistent with NMA estimates from augmented networks for 15 of 18 data sets. In the remaining 3 of 18 data sets, a more complex dose-response relationship was required than could be fitted with the available evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Where information on multiple doses is available, MBNMA can connect disconnected networks and increase precision while making less strong assumptions than alternative approaches. MBNMA relies on correct specification of the dose-response relationship, which requires sufficient data at different doses to allow reliable estimation. We recommend that systematic reviews for NMA search for and include evidence (including phase II trials) on multiple doses of agents where available.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",33448252,PMC7879230

The 2018 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations describe treatments for BD-associated oral ulcers with mucocutaneous involvement; however, little comparative effectiveness information for these agents is available. In the absence of head-to-head trials, an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) could provide useful evidence regarding comparative effectiveness of BD treatments. The purpose of this study was to conduct a comparative systematic literature review (SLR) and similarity assessment of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the oral ulcer-related efficacy outcomes of EULAR-recommended treatments for BD-associated oral ulcers to determine the feasibility of an ITC. METHODS: An SLR was performed to identify relevant RCTs indexed in MEDLINE/Embase before May 29, 2019. RCT similarities for the ITC were assessed based on a step-wise process recommended by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research. RESULTS: In total, 317 articles were identified, of which 14 RCTs, reflecting 11 EULAR-recommended treatments, were evaluated in a similarity assessment. Number of oral ulcers, resolution of oral ulcers, and healing time for oral ulcers were identified as the possible oral ulcer-related outcomes. After completing the similarity assessment of these outcomes, it was determined that a robust ITC was infeasible for the three oral ulcer-related outcomes due to heterogeneity in outcomes reporting, study design, and/or patient characteristics. More broadly, the results underscore the need for and consistent use of standardized measures for oral ulcer outcomes to facilitate comparative research. CONCLUSION: In the absence of head-to-head RCTs and infeasibility of quantitative ITC, comparative assessments for BD-associated oral ulcers are limited, including comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evaluations. Healthcare decision-makers must continue to base treatment decisions on the extent and strength of available evidence (eg, robust RCTs), clinical guidelines, real-world experience, and patient considerations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",33376418,PMC7762439

This study aimed to determine, through simulations, the impact of select factors on the validity and precision of NMA estimates when combining IPD and aggregate data (AgD) relative to using AgD only. METHODS: Three analysis strategies were compared via simulations: 1) AgD NMA without adjustments (AgD-NMA); 2) AgD NMA with meta-regression (AgD-NMA-MR); and 3) IPD-AgD NMA with meta-regression (IPD-NMA). We compared 108 parameter permutations: number of network nodes (3, 5 or 10); proportion of treatment comparisons informed by IPD (low, medium or high); equal size trials (2-armed with 200 patients per arm) or larger IPD trials (500 patients per arm); sparse or well-populated networks; and type of effect-modification (none, constant across treatment comparisons, or exchangeable). Data were generated over 200 simulations for each combination of parameters, each using linear regression with Normal distributions. To assess model performance and estimate validity, the mean squared error (MSE) and bias of treatment-effect and covariate estimates were collected. Standard errors (SE) and percentiles were used to compare estimate precision. RESULTS: Overall, IPD-NMA performed best in terms of validity and precision. The median MSE was lower in the IPD-NMA in 88 of 108 scenarios (similar results otherwise). On average, the IPD-NMA median MSE was 0.54 times the median using AgD-NMA-MR. Similarly, the SEs of the IPD-NMA treatment-effect estimates were 1/5 the size of AgD-NMA-MR SEs. The magnitude of superior validity and precision of using IPD-NMA varied across scenarios and was associated with the amount of IPD. Using IPD in small or sparse networks consistently led to improved validity and precision; however, in large/dense networks IPD tended to have negligible impact if too few IPD were included. Similar results also apply to the meta-regression coefficient estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Our simulation study suggests that the use of IPD in NMA will considerably improve the validity and precision of estimates of treatment effect and regression coefficients in the most NMA IPD data-scenarios. However, IPD may not add meaningful validity and precision to NMAs of large and dense treatment networks when negligible IPD are used.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",33435879,PMC7805229

The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy from a healthcare payer perspective in the UK. METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects of initiation of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg were based on an indirect comparison conducted using patient-level data, as there is currently no head-to-head clinical trial comparing these therapies. Modelled patients received treatments until glycated haemoglobin exceeded 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), at which point patients initiated basal insulin. The analysis captured pharmacy costs and costs of diabetes-related complications, expressed in 2019 pounds sterling (GBP). Projected outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. Scenario analyses were prepared to assess uncertainty around projected outcomes. RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with increases in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.12 years and 0.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, compared with empagliflozin 25 mg. Projected improvements in quality and duration of life resulted from a reduced cumulative incidence and a delayed time to onset of diabetes-related complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with increased pharmacy costs, but this was partially offset by avoided costs of treating complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with an increase in costs of GBP 1017 per patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 4439 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was projected to be a cost-effective treatment option from a healthcare payer perspective compared with empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33423240,PMC7846640

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A discretely integrated condition event model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatment with valbenazine and deutetrabenazine in a synthetic cohort of 1,000 patients with TD who were receiving antipsychotic medication to treat an underlying psychiatric disorder. Clinical inputs were derived from relevant clinical trials or from publicly available sources. Patients were assessed over 1 year using ≥50% improvement from baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) total score as the primary definition of response. Response at 1 year using Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) score ≤2 was also assessed. Health outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), life years, proportion responding to treatment at 1 year, and number of psychiatric relapses. RESULTS: Regardless of the definition used for response, patients treated with valbenazine were more likely to have responded to treatment at 1 year, lived longer, and accrued more QALYs than patients who received deutetrabenazine. Using the AIMS response criterion, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $9,951/QALY for valbenazine compared with deutetrabenazine. By comparison, using the CGIC response criterion valbenazine dominated deutetrabenazine with valbenazine-treated patients accumulating more QALYs (3.4 vs 3.3 years) and incurring lower lifetime costs ($252,311 vs $283,208) than deutetrabenazine-treated patients. LIMITATIONS: There are no head-to-head trials of valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, so probabilities of response used in the model were calculated based on an indirect treatment comparison of results from individual trials with one drug or the other, using only those metrics reported across trials. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with TD, treatment with valbenazine is highly cost-effective compared with deutetrabenazine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33393412,

Several approaches have been used to extend the half-life of rFVIII to improve prophylaxis outcomes. An indirect comparison of pivotal clinical trial data was performed to evaluate the relative efficacy of two extended half-life therapies approved for the prophylactic treatment of haemophilia A: recombinant FVIII-IgG(1) Fc domain fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) and pegylated rFVIII (BAY 94-9027). METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted to compare the rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis arm of the A-LONG phase III clinical trial (n = 117) and the BAY 94-9027 approved dosing regimens of the PROTECT VIII phase II/III study (n = 110). Following matching for baseline characteristics, mean annualised bleeding rate (ABR) and the proportion of patients with zero bleeds were compared for rFVIIIFc and BAY 94-9027. Additional supportive analyses comparing rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis and the individual prophylaxis regimens included in the PROTECT VIII group (twice weekly, and every 5 and 7 days [Q5D and Q7D]) were conducted. RESULTS: Mean ABR was lower in the rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis group versus the BAY 94-9027 pooled prophylaxis population (3.0 versus 4.9), providing a clinically relevant and statistically significant difference (mean difference [MD] - 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 3.5 to - 0.4). A statistically significant difference in ABR was also observed for rFVIIIFc compared with BAY 94-9027 Q7D (3.2 versus 6.4; MD - 3.3; 95% CI - 6.4 to - 0.2). The difference in the proportion of patients with zero bleeds between rFVIIIFc (46.5%) and BAY 94-9027 pooled prophylaxis population (38.2%) was not statistically significant (odds ratio 1.4; 95% CI 0.8 to 2.5). CONCLUSIONS: This indirect treatment comparison indicates a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference in ABR favouring individualised prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc versus BAY 94-9027 prophylaxis. The proportion of patients with zero bleeds was numerically greater with rFVIIIFc treatment but did not achieve statistical significance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",33377987,PMC7889532

This study examined the cost-effectiveness of ceritinib vs. crizotinib in the first-line treatment of ALK + NSCLC from a HK healthcare service provider's or government's perspective. METHODS: Costs and effectiveness of first-line ceritinib vs. crizotinib over a 20-year time horizon was evaluated using a partitioned survival model with three health states (stable disease, progressed disease, and death). The efficacy data for ceritinib were obtained from a phase 3 trial comparing ceritinib with chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (ASCEND-4) and extrapolated using parametric survival models. Long-term survival associated with crizotinib were estimated using hazard ratio of crizotinib vs. ceritinib obtained from matching-adjusted indirect comparison based on ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014 trials. Drug acquisition, administration, adverse events costs, and medical costs associated with each health state were obtained from public sources and converted to 2018 US Dollars. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY) gained were estimated for ceritinib vs. crizotinib. RESULTS: The base case results showed that ceritinib was associated with 3.22 QALYs, 4.51 LYs, and total costs of $157,581 over 20 years. Patients receiving crizotinib had 2.68 QALYs, 3.85 LYs, and $150,424 total costs over the same time horizon. The incremental cost per QALY gained for ceritinib vs crizotinib was $13,343. Results were robust to deterministic sensitivity analyses in most scenarios.

Across multiple treatment strategies varying in efficacy and costs, no clinical or economic studies directly compared them. This study aims to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of 10 commonly used pharmacologic combination strategies for T2DM. METHODS: Based on Chinese guideline and practice, 10 three-stepwise add-on strategies were identified, which start with metformin, then switch to metformin plus one oral drug (i.e., sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, α-glucosidase inhibitor, glinide, or DPP-4 inhibitor) as second line, and finally switch to metformin plus one injection (i.e., insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonist) as third line. A cohort of 10,000 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was established. From a healthcare system perspective, the Cardiff model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies, with clinical data sourced from a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 324 trials, costs from claims data of 1164 T2DM patients, and utilities from an EQ-5D study. Outcome measures include costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs). RESULTS: Over 40-year simulation, the costs accumulated for a patient ranged from $7661 with strategy 1 to $14,273 with strategy 10, while the QALY gains ranged from 13.965 with strategy 1 to 14.117 with strategy 8. Strategy 7 was dominant over seven strategies (strategies 2~6, 9~10) with higher QALYs but lower costs. Additionally, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $30,787/QALY (i.e., 3 times GDP/capita for China), strategy 7 was cost-effective compared with strategy 1 (ICER of strategy 7 vs. 1, $3371/QALY) and strategy 8 (ICER of strategy 8 vs. 7, $132,790/QALY). Ranking the strategies by ICERs and NMBs, strategy 7 provided the best value for money when compared to all other strategies, followed by strategies 5, 9, 8, 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, and 4. Scenario analyses showed that patients insist on pharmacologic treatments increased their QALYs (0.456~0.653) at an acceptable range of cost increase (ICERs, $1450/QALY~$12,360/QALY) or even at cost saving compared with those not receive treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence-based references for diabetes management. Our findings can be used to design the essential drug formulary, infer clinical practice, and help the decision-maker design reimbursement policy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33267884,PMC7713153

The comparative efficacy of HP/TAZ compared with other active topical therapies (including betamethasone dipropionate [BD] 0.5 mg/g and calcipotriol [CAL] 50 mcg/g) is uncertain. The cost-effectiveness of HP/TAZ compared with relevant comparators for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis remains uncertain. CADTH reanalyses estimated that HP/TAZ is associated with a gain of 0.0004 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with BD/CAL, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $85,670 per QALY. This estimate of the cost-effectiveness may be more representative of patients with a milder plaque psoriasis than the proposed indication, who are eligible to receive topical monotherapy and do not have access to phototherapy. CADTH illustrated that the ICERs are highly sensitive to changes in parameter values, and thus, the cost-effectiveness estimates for HP/TAZ in this setting should be interpreted with caution. While the drug cost of HP/TAZ is less than the cost of the individual components based on a per gram list prices, HP/TAZ is more expensive than other relevant comparators such as BD/CAL.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,not_original_article",33570887,

In Canada, it has been estimated that around 300,000 people are living with epilepsy based on The Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (September 2017). Anti-epileptic drugs (AED) are the mainstay of pharmacological management of epilepsy. Often, patients are treated with multiple AEDs, which are decided based on factors related to patients (e.g., age, type and frequency of seizures, comorbidities), and drugs (e.g., drug interactions, safety profile). Brivaracetam (BRV) is an AED in the racetam group which was discovered as an analog to the related racetam drug levetiracetam (LEV). Both drugs have a similar mechanism of action with a selective and high affinity for binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A, but they may differ in their pharmacological profiles. BRV is approved by Health Canada as adjunctive therapy in the management of partial-onset seizures in adult patients with epilepsy who are not satisfactorily controlled with conventional therapy. A CADTH Common Drug Review (CDR) assessment found that, based on evidence from four multicenter placebo controlled randomized trials, BRV demonstrated significantly greater reductions in seizure frequency compared to placebo. In the absence of head -to head trials, evidence regarding comparative efficacy and safety of BRV versus LEV is limited. An indirect treatment comparison found no statistical differences between LEV and BRV with respect to efficacy and adverse events (AE) - overall and non-behavioral-except dizziness, which occurred at a significantly higher rate with high dose levels of BRV. Behavioral adverse events (BAE) appear to be less prevalent in BRV than with LEV based on evidence from pre-clinical studies and clinical studies.(,)(,) The purpose of this report is to summarize the evidence regarding the comparative clinical safety of BRV compared to LEV among patients with epilepsy with mental health conditions as well as in patients with epilepsy who experienced psychiatric or behavioral adverse events with previous LEV treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,not_original_article",33555772,

In the absence of head-to-head trials comparing their effectiveness, this study assessed the efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg once-daily monotherapy/combination therapy against tofacitinib 5 mg twice-daily combination therapy among patients with RA using matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs). METHODS: The first of two MAICs used individual patient data (IPD) from the 14-week SELECT-MONOTHERAPY trial (upadacitinib [n = 217] vs. methotrexate [n = 216]) and published data from the ORAL Standard trial (tofacitinib + methotrexate [n = 204] vs. methotrexate [n = 108]). The second MAIC used IPD from the 26-week SELECT-COMPARE trial (upadacitinib + methotrexate [n = 647] vs. adalimumab + methotrexate [n = 324]) and published data from ORAL Strategy (tofacitinib + methotrexate [n = 376] vs. adalimumab + methotrexate [n = 386]). Data from patients in the upadacitinib trials were re-weighted based on age, sex, race, swollen joint count 66/28, tender joint count 68/28, C-reactive protein (CRP), and patients' global assessments to match the patient characteristics in tofacitinib trials. After matching, ACR20/50/70 and clinical remission (SDAI[CRP] ≤ 3.3, CDAI ≤ 2.8, DAS28-ESR/CRP < 2.6) were compared for upadacitinib vs. tofacitinib + methotrexate at month 3 and upadacitinib + methotrexate vs. tofacitinib + methotrexate at months 3 and 6 using Wald tests. RESULTS: At month 3, upadacitinib monotherapy patients experienced significantly larger improvement in ACR70 compared to tofacitinib + methotrexate (mean difference in difference [DID]: 9.9%; p = 0.019), while upadacitinib + methotrexate was associated with higher ACR50 compared to tofacitinib + methotrexate (DID: 12.9%; p = 0.011).

However, the key issue was the extent to which the benefit in PFS could translate into a prolongation of OS. Methods: We performed a systematical literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials and Embase, as well as meeting online archives up to February 2020. The primary outcome was OS, and we performed indirect treatment comparisons depend on a meta-analysis. Results: Six RCTs were eligible including 3421 breast cancer patients. Compared to the endocrine therapy alone group, adding CDK4/6 inhibitors to endocrine therapy had significantly improved OS (HR=0.76, 95% CI=0.68-0.85, P<0.001). Moreover, the OS advantage was consistent in patients with different combined endocrine therapy, endocrine sensitivity status, sites of distant metastasis, menopausal status and age.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper summarises the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's critical review on the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, highlights the key methodological considerations, and describes the development of the NICE guidance by the Appraisal Committee. The CS included one relevant study, for the comparison of R(2) versus rituximab monotherapy (R-mono): the AUGMENT trial. In addition, the company performed an unanchored indirect comparison of R(2) versus rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) and rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CVP), using data for R(2) from the AUGMENT trial and pooled data for R-CHOP/R-CVP from the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) database. During the STA process, the company provided an addendum containing evidence on only the FL population, in line with the marketing authorisation obtained at that time, which did not include MZL. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) presented by the company were £27,768 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for R(2) versus R-CHOP, £41,602 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-CVP, and £23,412 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-mono. The ERG's concerns included the validity of the unanchored comparison, the unavailability of a state transition model to verify the outcomes of the partitioned survival model, substantial uncertainty in survival curves, and potential over-estimation of utility values. The revised ERG base case resulted in ICERs ranging from £16,874 to £44,888 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-CHOP, from £23,135 to £59,810 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-CVP, and from £18,779 to £27,156 per QALY gained for R(2) versus R-mono. Substantial uncertainty remained around these ranges.

A very common, and closely related, scenario is where a company has individual patient data (IPD) from its own trial, but only has published aggregate data from a competitor's trial, and an indirect comparison of the treatments evaluated in these two trials is required. Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) has been developed for this situation, where we use the available IPD to adjust for between-trial imbalances in the distributions of observed baseline covariates between the two trials. We extend the current MAIC methodology, where we compute the weights that satisfy the conventional method of moments and result in the largest possible effective sample size (ESS). We show that the approach proposed by Zubizarreta in a previous study can be used for this purpose. We derive a new analytical result that shows why this alternative approach provides a larger ESS than a conventional MAIC. We also derive a new formula for the maximum ESS that can be achieved, even when permitting negative weights, when adjusting for one covariate. This can be used as an easily computed new metric that quantifies the difficulty in adjusting for covariates. What is already known: MAIC is an established way to perform population adjustment in the situation where IPD is available from one trial but only aggregate level data is available from another trial, and an indirect comparison is required. However the effective sample size (ESS) can be small after making the adjustment. What is new: We show that an alternative method can result in a larger ESS. We provide new analytical results showing why this is the case. We derive a new descriptive statistic that is based on maximising the ESS that quantifies the difficulties in adjusting for particular covariates. Potential impact for RSM readers outside the authors' field: Reweighting methods for population adjustment are becoming more commonly used and their implications for research synthesis methodology is now considerable.

RESULTS: Overall, I+C had a lower rate of grade 3 or higher irAEs than I (7.1% vs 10.6%; indirect RR, 0.516; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.291-0.916), although irAEs of any grade were similar. The rate of pneumonitis with I+C was lower than the rate with I for any grade (5.9% vs 7.1%; indirect RR, 0.217; 95% CI, 0.080-0.588) and for grade 3 or higher. In the endocrine system, I+C was associated with a lower overall ratein comparison with I (16.1% vs 20.1%; indirect RR, 0.260; 95% CI, 0.120-0.564), whereas irAEs of the digestive system were similar with I+C and I. In other systems, I+C decreased the rate of skin reactions, including rash, in comparison with I (10.4% vs 12.9%; indirect RR, 0.474; 95% CI, 0.299-0.751). The rate of grade 3 or higher skin reactions (excluding rash) also decreased with I+C versus I (1.1% vs 2.0%) with an indirect RR of 0.158 (95% CI, 0.032-0.765), whereas other included irAEs were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone, a combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of NSCLC decreased the rates of most irAEs, such as pneumonitis and endocrine and skin reactions, and the overall rate. LAY SUMMARY: In the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the addition of chemotherapy to a programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-(L)1) inhibitor is a more effective option. Adding chemotherapy might reduce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Thus, this article assesses the rate of irAEs with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy (I+C) in comparison with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone (I) and evaluates the indirect relative risk (RR) with I+C versus I. The key finding is that in comparison with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone, a combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of NSCLC decreases the rates of most irAEs, such as pneumonitis and endocrine and skin reactions, and the overall rate.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33119182,

Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is usually part of a disseminated disease in AIDS patients with a low CD4 count, however with standard antiretroviral therapy (ART), a localized presentation is more likely. It can affect any part of the GIT, mostly the duodenum and typically as patches. Incomplete or refractory ART for HIV-strains, therapy-related side effects, noncompliant or incomplete treatment to previous MAIC infections, superimposed complications and comorbid opportunistic infections may result in atypical clinical, endoscopic and histopathologic manifestations. We performed a retrospective review study retrieving cases of MAIC in duodenal endoscopic biopsy. We found five cases of MAIC in HIV/AIDS patients. They were males with an average age of 40-years. They showed different histopathologic features, variable patterns of MAIC-histiocytic infiltrates, and varying intensity of intracellular acid-fast positive bacilli. Enterocytes vacuolization and transepithelial elimination were also observed. Three cases were associated with cytomegalovirus and cryptococcal infections. A case was complicated by lymphangiectasia-associated protein-losing enteropathy. Initially, three cases were morphologically missed. Ziehl-Neelsen stain helped reach the correct diagnosis. Pathologists have an important role in patients' management by guiding clinicians to the correct diagnosis. Pathologists should be aware of these different histopathologic manifestations, their potential pitfalls, look for certain helpful clues complemented with multiple levels and special stains. In particular, AFB stains are mandatory in all mucosal biopsy specimens from HIV/AIDS patients regardless of their appearances.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",33069083,

In Latin America, bortezomib- or thalidomide-based regimens remain standard of care (SoC) for this population. No head-to-head trials have compared D-VMP with SoC regimens used in Latin America. METHODS: Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to control for baseline differences between patient populations and compare outcomes for D-VMP versus SoC regimens used in Latin America. Data for the D-VMP cohort were from the D-VMP arm of the ALCYONE trial (n = 350). Data for the SoC cohort were from the retrospective, observational Hemato-Oncology Latin America (HOLA) study, which included patients with NDMM who did not receive a transplant (n = 729). Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression. Exact, optimal, and nearest-neighbor PSM were applied to pick the best-performing method. Doubly robust estimation was the base case, since some baseline imbalances persisted. RESULTS: All 350 patients from the D-VMP arm of ALCYONE were included in OS/PFS analyses and 338 in ORR analysis; 478 and 324 patients, respectively, from HOLA were included in these analyses. Naïve comparison revealed important differences in baseline characteristics (age, chronic kidney disease, hypercalcemia, and International Staging System [ISS] stage). After nearest-neighbor matching, baseline characteristics, except ISS stage, were well balanced; comparisons favored D-VMP over SoC for OS (hazard ratio = 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.66; P = 0.002) and PFS (hazard ratio = 0.48; 95% CI 0.35-0.67; P < 0.001). After exact matching, imbalances remained in age and ISS stage; comparisons favored D-VMP over SoC for ORR (odds ratio = 5.44; 95% CI 2.65-11.82; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In transplant-ineligible patients with NDMM, D-VMP showed superior effectiveness versus bortezomib- and thalidomide-based regimens, supporting adoption of daratumumab-containing regimens in Latin America.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read,FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Very likely only patients data, but PS + ITC so to be checked""]}",33067698,PMC7595972

Limited information is known about the effects of patient characteristics on VTE efficacy and safety of DOACs compared with VKAs, without appropriate effect modifier adjustment comparisons of DOACs may be biased. This study considers the effect of variables that can modify the efficacy and safety of edoxaban and warfarin, using patient-level data. Materials and Methods  The primary efficacy and safety outcomes in the HOKUSAI-VTE study were VTE recurrence and clinically relevant bleeding, respectively. Potential effect modifiers were age, creatinine clearance, and weight. The relationship between the percentage of time in international normalized ratio (INR) control and outcomes were considered for the warfarin arm. Univariate and multivariate regression were performed for each patient characteristic. Results  The relationship between treatment and VTE recurrence differed by age (interaction p  = 0.007) and by creatinine clearance ( p  = 0.05). VTE recurrence differed by age for patients in the warfarin arm but not for those in the edoxaban arm and differed by INR control in the warfarin arm ( p  < 0.005). A stronger relationship between creatinine clearance and clinically relevant bleeding was found in the warfarin arm than in the edoxaban arm ( p  = 0.04). Clinically relevant bleeding differed by the percentage of time in INR control in the warfarin arm ( p  < 0.005). Age appeared to be a more important effect modifier than creatinine clearance in patients with VTE. Discussion  The finding that efficacy in older patients was greater for those taking edoxaban than for those taking warfarin in the HOKUSAI-VTE study needs further investigation. Modification of the treatment effect by age for those taking warfarin might bias estimates of comparative effectiveness among DOACs if VKAs are the reference treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",33062927,PMC7553796

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis and an indirect treatment comparison to investigate the efficacy and safety of different doses of SCS in subjects with COPD exacerbation. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching different databases for randomized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy and safety of SCS with placebo in subjects with exacerbation of COPD. The different doses of SCS were assigned to low-dose (ie, initial dose ≤ 40 mg prednisone equivalent/d [PE/d]), medium-dose (initial dose = 40-100 mg PE/d, and high-dose (initial dose > 100 mg PE/d) groups. The indirect treatment comparison was performed between low-, medium-, and high-dose SCS groups. RESULTS: Twelve trials with 1,375 participates were included. Compared to placebo, the risk of treatment failure was lower in the low-dose SCS groups (risk ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.43-0.88], P = .007) and high-dose SCS groups (risk ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.48-0.85], P = .002); the FEV(1) was significantly improved in low-dose (mean difference 0.09 [95% CI 0.06-0.12], P < .001), medium-dose (mean difference 0.23 [95% CI 0.02-0.44], P = .036), and high-dose SCS groups (mean difference 0.09, [95% CI 0.03-0.15], P < .001, respectively). Regarding safety, the incidence of hyperglycemia was higher in high-dose SCS groups versus placebo (risk ratio 2.52 [95% CI 1.13-5.62], P = .02). The indirect comparison between low-, medium-, and high-dose SCS found that the risk of treatment failure and changes in FEV(1) were similar between these doses of SCS. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that low-dose SCS (initial dose ≤ 40 mg PE/d) was sufficient and safer for treating subjects with COPD exacerbation, and it was noninferior to higher doses of SCS (initial dose > 40 mg PE/d) in improving FEV(1) and reducing the risk of treatment failure. However, our findings need to be verified in head-to-head randomized controlled trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33051255,

In fact, the origins of Cochrane Neonatal precede the establishment of the collaboration. In the 1980's, the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at Oxford, led by Dr. Iain Chalmers, established the ""Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials"" (ODPT), a register of virtually all randomized controlled trials in perinatal medicine to provide a resource for reviews of the safety and efficacy of interventions used in perinatal care and to foster cooperative and coordinated research efforts in the perinatal field [1]. An effort that was clearly ahead of its time, ODPT comprised four main elements: a register of published reports of trials; a register of unpublished trials; a register of ongoing and planned trials; and data derived from pooled overviews (meta-analyses) of trials. This core effort grew into the creation of the seminal books, ""Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth"" as well as ""Effective Care of the Newborn Infant"" [2,3]. As these efforts in perinatal medicine grew, Iain Chalmers thought well beyond perinatal medicine into the creation of a worldwide collaboration that became Cochrane [4]. The mission of the Cochrane Collaboration is to promote evidence-informed health decision-making by producing high-quality, relevant, accessible systematic reviews and other synthesized research evidence (www.cochrane.org). Cochrane Neonatal has continued to be one of the most productive review groups, publishing between 25 tpo to 40 new or updated systematic reviews each year. The impact factor has been steadily increasing over four years and now rivals most of the elite journals in pediatric medicine. Cochrane Neonatal has been a worldwide effort. Currently, there are 404 reviews involving 1206 authors from 52 countries. What has Cochrane done for babies? Reviews from Cochrane Neonatal have informed guidelines and recommendations worldwide. From January 2018 through June 2020, 77 international guidelines cited 221 Cochrane Neonatal reviews. These recommendations have included recommendations of the use of postnatal steroids, inhaled nitric oxide, feeding guidelines for preterm infants and other core aspects of neonatal practice. In addition, Cochrane Reviews has been the impetus for important research, including the large-scale trial of prophylactic indomethacin therapy, a variety of trials of postnatal steroids, trials of emollient ointment and probiotic trials [6]. While justifiably proud of these accomplishments, one needs to examine the future contribution of Cochrane Neonatal to the neonatal community. The future of Cochrane Neonatal is inexorably linked to the future of neonatal research. Obviously, there is no synthesis of trials data if, as a community, we fail to provide the core substrate for that research. As we look at the current trials' environment, fewer randomized controlled trial related to neonates are being published in recent years. A simple search of PubMed, limiting the search to ""neonates"" and ""randomized controlled trials"" shows that in the year 2000, 321 randomized controlled trials were published. These peaked five years ago, in 2015, with close to 900 trials being published. However, in 2018, only 791 studies are identified. Does this decrease represent a meaningful change in the neonatal research environment? Quite possibly. There are shifting missions of clinical neonatology at academic medical institutions, at least in the United States, with a focus on business aspects as well as other important competing clinical activities. Quality improvement has taken over as one of the major activities at both private and academic neonatal practices. Clearly, this is a needed improvement. All units at levels need to be dedicated to improving the outcomes of the sick and fragile population we care for. However, this need not be at the expense of formal clinical trials. It is understandable that this approach would be taken. Newer interventions frequently relate to complex systems of care and not the simple single interventions. Even trials that might traditionally have been done as randomized controlled trials, such as the introduction of a new mode of ventilation, are in reality complex challenges to the ability of institutions to create systems to adapt to these new technologies. Cost of doing trials has always been a barrier. The challenging regulatory and ethical environment contributes to these problems as well [7]. Despite these barriers, how does the research agenda of the neonatal community move forward in the 21st Century? We need to reassess how we create and disseminate our research findings. Innovative trial designs will allow us to address complex issues that we may not have tackled with conventional trials. Adaptive designs may allow us to look at potentially life-saving therapies in a way that feel more efficient and more ethical [8]. Clarifying issues such as the use of inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants would be greatly served if we even knew whether or not there are hypoxemic preterm infant who would benefit from this therapy [9]. Current trials do not suggest so, yet current practice tells us that a significant number of these babies will receive inhaled nitric oxide [10-13]. Adaptive design, such as those done with trials of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), would allow us to quickly assess whether, in fact, these therapies are life-saving and allow us to consider whether or not further trials are needed [14,15]. Our understanding that many interventions involve entire systems approaches does not relegate us only to doing quality improvement work. Cluster designs may allow us to test more complex interventions that have usually been under the purview of quality improvement [16-18]. Cluster trials are well suited for such investigations and can be done with the least interruption to ongoing care. Ultimately, quality improvement is the application of the best evidence available (evidence-based medicine is ""what to do"" and evidence-based practice is ""how to do""). [19,20]. Nascent efforts, such as the statement on ""embedding necessary research into culture and health"" (the ENRICH statement) call for the conduct of large, efficient pragmatic trials to evaluate neonatal outcomes, as in part called for in the ALPHA Collaboration [21,22]. This statement envisions an international system to identify important research questions by consulting regularly with all stakeholders, including patients, public health professionals, researchers, providers, policy makers, regulators, funders of industry. The ENRICH statement envisions a pathway to enable individuals, educational institutions, hospitals and health-care facilities to confirm their status as research-friendly by integrating an understanding of trials, other research and critical thinking and to teaching learning and culture, as well as an engagement with funders, professional organizations and regulatory bodies and other stake holders to raise awareness of the value of efficient international research to reduce barriers to large international pragmatic trials and other collaborative studies. In the future, if trials are to be done on this scale or trials are prospectively designed to be analyzed together, core outcome measures must be identified and standardized. That clinical trials supply estimates of outcomes that are relevant to patients and their families is critical. In addition, current neonatal research evaluates many different outcomes using multiple measures. A given measure can have multiple widely used definitions. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (or chronic lung disease just to add to the confusion) quickly comes to mind [23,24]. The use of multiple definitions when attempting to measure the same outcome prevents synthesis of trial results and meta-analysis and hinders efforts to refine our estimates of effects. Towards that end, Webbe and colleagues have set out to develop a core outcome set for neonatal research [25]. Key stakeholders in the neonatal community reviewed multiple outcomes reported in neonatal trials and qualitative studies. Based on consensus, key outcome measures were identified, including survival, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain injury on imaging, retinopathy or prematurity, gross motor ability, general cognitive ability, quality of life, adverse events, visual impairment or blindness, hearing impairment or deafness, chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Trials registration has to be a continued focus of the neonatal community. Trials registration allows for systematic reviewers to understand whether or not reporting bias has occurred [26]. It also allows for transparent incorporation of these core outcome measures. Ultimately, trials registration should include public reporting of all of these core outcomes and, in the future, access to data on an individual level such that more sophisticated individual patient data meta-analysis could occur. Lastly, there is no reason to see clinical trials and quality improvement as separate or exclusive activities. In fact, in the first NICQ Collaborative, conducted by Vermont Oxford Network, participation in a trial of postnatal steroids was considered part of the quality improvement best practices as opposed to simply choosing an as-of-yet unproven approach to use of this potent drug [27]. What role will Cochrane Neonatal play as we move forward in the 21st Century? As the neonatal community moves forward with its' research agenda, Cochrane Neonatal must not only follow but also lead with innovative approaches to synthesizing research findings. Cochrane Neonatal must continue to work closely with guideline developers. The relationship between systematic review production and guideline development is clearly outlined in reports from the Institute of Medicine [28,29]. Both are essential to guideline development; the systematic review group culling the evidence for the benefits and harms of a given intervention and the guideline group addressing the contextual issues of cost, feasibility, implementation and the values and preferences of individuals and societies. Most national and international guidelines groups now routinely use systematic reviews as the evidence basis for their guidelines and recommendations. Examples of the partnership between Cochrane Neonatal and international guideline development can be seen in our support of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on the use of vitamin A or the soon to be published recommendations from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) on cord management in preterm and term infants [30]. In the future, we need to collaborate early in the guideline development process so that the reviews are fit for purpose and meet the needs of the guideline developers and the end users. Towards this end, all Cochrane Neonatal reviews now contain GRADE assessments of the key clinical findings reported in the systematic review [31]. Addition of these assessments addresses the critical issue of our confidence in the findings. We are most confident in evidence provided by randomized controlled trials but this assessment can be can be downgraded if the studies that reported on the outcome in question had a high risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency of results, or imprecision, or where there is evidence of reporting bias. Information provided by GRADE assessments is seen as critical in the process of moving from the evidence to formal recommendations [32]. We need to explore complex reviews, such as network (NMA) or multiple treatment comparison (MCT) meta-analyses, to address issues not formally addressed in clinical trials [33]. In conditions where there are multiple effective interventions, it is rare for all possible interventions to have been tested against each other [34]. A solution could be provided by network meta-analysis, which allows for comparing all treatments with each other, even if randomized controlled trials are not available for some treatment comparisons [34]. Network meta-analysis uses both direct (head-to-head) randomized clinical trial (RCT) evidence as well as indirect evidence from RCTs to compare the relative effectiveness of all included interventions [35]. However, Mills and colleagues note that the methodological quality of MTCs may be difficult for clinicians to interpret because the number of interventions evaluated may be large and the methodological approaches may be complex [35]. Cochrane Neonatal must take a role in both the creation of such analyses and the education of the neonatal community regarding the pitfalls of such an approach. The availability of individual patient data will make more sophisticated analyses more available to the community. Although the current crop of individual patient data meta-analyses (including the reviews of elective high frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide and oxygen targets) have not differed substantially from the findings of the trials level reviews (suggesting that, in fact, sick neonates are more alike that unalike), there still will be a large role for individual patient data meta-analysis, at least to end the unfound conclusions that these therapies are effective in various subgroups (be it issues of sex, disease severity, or clinical setting) [36-39]. Future trials should take a lesson from the NeOProM Collaborative [37,39]. Given the difficulty in generating significant sample size and creating funding in any single environment, trials with similar protocols should be conducted in a variety of healthcare settings with an eye towards both study level and individual patient level meta-analysis at the conclusion of those trials, allowing for broader contribution to the trials data, more rapid accrual of sample size, and more precise results. We need to educate the neonatal community regarding the use and abuse of diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests are a critical component of healthcare but also contribute greatly to the cost of medical care worldwide. These costs include the cost of the tests themselves and the costs of misdiagnosis and treatment of individuals who will not benefit from those treatments. Clinicians may have a limited understanding of diagnostic test accuracy, the ability of a diagnostic test to distinguish between patients with and without the disease or target condition [41,42]. Efforts such as Choosing Wisely have tried to identify these deficiencies [40]. As Cochrane has increased the general literacy of both the medical and general population regarding the interpretation of the results of interventions on various diseases, so should Cochrane move forward and improve the understanding of diagnostic testing. We need to become more efficient at creating and maintaining our reviews. The time spent to produce systematic reviews is far too great. In average, it takes between 2½ to 6½ years to produce a systematic review, requiring intense time input for highly trained and expensive experts. Innovations in the ways in which we produce systematic reviews can make the review process more efficient by outsourcing some of the tasks or crowdsourcing to machine learning. We need to let the crowd and machine learning innovations help us sort the massive amounts of information needed to conduct systematic reviews. It can also allow for ""live"" updating of critical reviews where the research landscape is quickly changing [43]. Lastly, Cochrane Neonatal must focus more on users of the reviews and not necessarily authors of the reviews. Current Cochrane programming speaks of Cochrane training with an eye towards developing the skills of individuals who will conduct systematic reviews. While this is clearly needed and laudable, the fact of the matter is that most of the community will be ""users"" of the reviews. Individuals who need to understand how to use and interpret the findings of systematic reviews. These review users include clinicians, guideline developers, policy makers and families. Incorporation of GRADE guidelines has been a huge step in adding transparency to the level of uncertainty we have in our findings. From a family's perspective, we need to overcome the environment of mistrust or misunderstanding of scientific evidence and how we convey what we know, and our uncertainty about what we know, to parents and families.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",33036834,

Population adjustment methods such as multilevel network meta-regression (ML-NMR), matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), and simulated treatment comparison (STC) relax this assumption using individual patient data from one or more studies, and are becoming increasingly prevalent in health technology appraisals and the applied literature. Motivated by an applied example and two recent reviews of applications, we undertook an extensive simulation study to assess the performance of these methods in a range of scenarios under various failures of assumptions. We investigated the impact of varying sample size, missing effect modifiers, strength of effect modification and validity of the shared effect modifier assumption, validity of extrapolation and varying between-study overlap, and different covariate distributions and correlations. ML-NMR and STC performed similarly, eliminating bias when the requisite assumptions were met. Serious concerns are raised for MAIC, which performed poorly in nearly all simulation scenarios and may even increase bias compared with standard indirect comparisons. All methods incur bias when an effect modifier is missing, highlighting the necessity of careful selection of potential effect modifiers prior to analysis. When all effect modifiers are included, ML-NMR and STC are robust techniques for population adjustment. ML-NMR offers additional advantages over MAIC and STC, including extending to larger treatment networks and producing estimates in any target population, making this an attractive choice in a variety of scenarios.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",33015906,PMC8690023

This systematic literature review evaluated clinical evidence on treatments for patients with R/R DLBCL ineligible for, or relapsed following, stem cell transplantation. METHODS: We assessed the feasibility of conducting an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) or network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with bendamustine + rituximab versus other relevant treatments. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were identified, of which 20 were eligible [seven randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); 13 observational/single-arm trials]. Due to a lack of RCTs, an ITC/NMA summary of the relative efficacy and safety of the treatment options was not possible. Only two of the seven RCTs had positive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the paucity of published RCTs to establish the comparative efficacy of treatments for transplant-ineligible R/R DLBCL and lack of standard of care in this setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",33001384,PMC7595978

CADTH accounted for some limitations, including changing the model’s relapse definition, selecting an alternate parametric distribution for time to first relapse, assuming lifelong treatment, capturing costs associated with administration and vaccination, and assuming eculizumab would be administered in outpatient clinics. In CADTH’s base case, eculizumab plus SOC was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $1,508,152 per QALY gained compared with SOC alone in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive. A price reduction of 96% would be required for eculizumab plus SOC to achieve an ICER below a WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY. The results of CADTH’s reanalysis are highly dependent on the treatment effects of eculizumab plus SOC compared to SOC alone. Several limitations were associated with the PREVENT trial (e.g., the absence of relevant outcomes related to subsequent relapses after the first relapse; high rates of major protocol deviation) that could not be addressed by CADTH. In the submitted model, the majority of the incremental clinical benefits were found to occur beyond the trial observed period; there is high uncertainty associated with this extrapolation. The cost-effectiveness of eculizumab compared to rituximab, mitoxantrone, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is unknown in the absence of both direct and indirect treatment comparisons. Interpretation of the economic results therefore warrants careful consideration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: economics,FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,not_original_article",33570892,

METHODS: To evaluate the methods using a Monte Carlo approach, a thousand repetitions of simulated data sets were generated for two single-arm trials. In each repetition, researchers were assumed to have access to individual-level patient data (IPD) for one of the trials and the published Kaplan-Meier curve of another. First, we compared the raw data and the reconstructed IPD using Cox regressions to determine the performance of the data reconstruction method. Then, we evaluated alternative unanchored MAIC strategies with varying completeness of covariates for matching in terms of bias, efficiency, and confidence interval coverage. Finally, we proposed a bias factor-adjusted approach to gauge the true effects when unanchored MAIC estimates might be biased due to omitted variables. RESULTS: Reconstructed data sufficiently represented raw data in the sense that the difference between the raw and reconstructed data was not statistically significant over the one thousand repetitions. Also, the bias of unanchored MAIC estimates ranged from minimal to substantial as the set of covariates became less complete. More, the confidence interval estimates of unanchored MAIC were suboptimal even using the complete set of covariates. Finally, the bias factor-adjusted method we proposed substantially reduced omitted variable bias. CONCLUSIONS: Unanchored MAIC should be used to analyze time-to-event outcomes with caution. The bias factor may be used to gauge the true treatment effect.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",32993519,PMC7526361

We therefore analyzed a cohort of real-world patients and performed a matched adjusted indirect comparison with a cohort of patients treated with ibrutinib. One hundred and fifty-seven patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <70 mL/min and/or CIRS score >6 were treated with BR. The median age was 72 years; 69% of patients had ≥2 comorbidities and the median CrCl was 59.8 mL/min. 17.6% of patients carried TP53 disruption. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 45 months; TP53 disruption was associated with a shorter PFS (P = 0.05). The overall survival (OS) at 12, 24, and 36 months was 96.2%, 90.1%, and 79.5%, respectively. TP53 disruption was associated with an increased risk of death (P = 0.01). Data on 162 patients ≥65 years treated with ibrutinib were analyzed and compared with 165 patients ≥65 years treated with BR. Factors predicting for a longer PFS at multivariable analysis in the total patient population treated with BR and ibrutinib were age (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10, P < 0.01) and treatment with ibrutinib (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.93, P = 0.03). In a post hoc analysis of patients in advanced stage, a significant PFS advantage was observed in patient who had received ibrutinib (P = 0.03), who showed a trend for OS advantage (P = 0.08). We arrived at the following conclusions: (a) BR is a relatively effective first-line regimen in a real-world population of unfit patients without TP53 disruption, (b) ibrutinib provided longer disease control than BR in patients with advanced disease stage.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",32969597,PMC7666748

This ranges from supplementing contemporary data to increase the power of trials to cross-trial comparisons in estimating comparative efficacy. In many cases, these approaches are performed without in-depth review of the context of data, which may lead to bias and incorrect conclusions. METHODS: We discuss the original 'Pocock' criteria for the use of historical data and how the use of historical data has evolved over time. Based on these factors and personal experience, we created a series of questions that may be asked of historical data, prior to their use. Based on the answers to these questions, various statistical approaches are recommended. The strategy is illustrated with a case study in colorectal cancer. RESULTS: A number of areas need to be considered with historical data, which we split into three categories: outcome measurement, study/patient characteristics (including setting and inclusion/exclusion criteria), and disease process/intervention effects. Each of these areas may introduce issues if not appropriately handled, while some may preclude the use of historical data entirely. We present a tool (in the form of a table) for highlighting any such issues. Application of the tool to a colorectal cancer data set demonstrates under what conditions historical data could be used and what the limitations of such an analysis would be. CONCLUSION: Historical data can be a powerful tool to augment or compare with contemporary trial data, though caution is required. We present some of the issues that may be considered when involving historical data and what (if any) statistical approaches may account for differences between studies. We recommend that, where historical data are to be used in analyses, potential differences between studies are addressed explicitly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",32957804,PMC7649932

In this study, we aimed to conduct a network meta-analysis for comparing the efficacy of these agents. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials databases for relevant literature, up to February 2020. The data were collected from randomized controlled trials on regorafenib, trifluridine/tipiracil, or fruquintinib, administered to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who failed on treatment with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, or fluoropyrimidine. The primary end points, namely, the overall survival and progression-free survival, were analyzed for subsequent network analysis using the Review Manager and Aggregate Data Drug Information System software for performing direct and indirect comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 7 trials were analyzed in this study. Trifluridine/tipiracil and regorafenib proved to be superior to the placebo, with respect to the overall survival (odds ratio: 0.38, 95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.52 for trifluridine/tipiracil; odds ratio: 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.26-0.84 for regorafenib) and progression-free survival (odds ratio: 0.18, 95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.67 for trifluridine/tipiracil; odds ratio: 0.06, 95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.09 for regorafenib). Regorafenib (80 mg) was superior to the placebo in terms of the overall survival and progression-free survival and inferior to trifluridine/tipiracil and fruquintinib. Network analysis revealed that the efficacy of trifluridine/tipiracil and fruquintinib was fundamentally similar, and both the agents were superior to regorafenib. CONCLUSION: Regorafenib (80 mg) was superior to the placebo, but inferior to 160 mg regorafenib, trifluridine/tipiracil, and fruquintinib. This study further revealed that the efficiency of trifluridine/tipiracil and fruquintinib is identical, but their toxicity profiles are different.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32914703,PMC7488883

This analysis indirectly compares the efficacy of patisiran and inotersen on neuropathy and quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Published results from the NEURO-TTR study of inotersen and individual patient data from the APOLLO study of patisiran were used. Indirect comparisons were conducted for 15-month changes in neuropathy and QOL endpoints: modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7(Ionis,)), Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) questionnaire, body mass index (BMI), and Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score.

We assessed the comparative efficacy of different strategies for management of achalasia, through a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: We identified six randomized controlled trials in adults with achalasia that compared the efficacy of pneumatic dilation (PD; n = 260), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM; n = 309), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM; n = 176). Primary efficacy outcome was 1-year treatment success (patient-reported improvement in symptoms based on validated scores); secondary efficacy outcomes were 2-year treatment success and physiologic improvement; safety outcomes were risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), severe erosive esophagitis, and procedure-related serious adverse events. We performed pairwise and network meta-analysis for all treatments, and used GRADE criteria to appraise quality of evidence. RESULTS: Low-quality evidence, based primarily on direct evidence, supports the use of POEM (RR [risk ratio], 1.29; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.99-1.69), and LHM (RR, 1.18 [0.96-1.44]) over PD for treatment success at 1 year; no significant difference was observed between LHM and POEM (RR 1.09 [0.86-1.39]). The incidence of severe esophagitis after POEM, LHM, and PD was 5.3%, 3.7%, and 1.5%, respectively. Procedure-related serious adverse event rate after POEM, LHM, and PD was 1.4%, 6.7%, and 4.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: POEM and LHM have comparable efficacy, and may increase treatment success as compared to PD with low confidence in estimates. POEM may have lower rate of serious adverse events compared to LHM and PD, but higher rate of GERD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32856150,PMC8011535

RWD and RWE have demonstrated the significant potential to improve the design, planning, and execution of clinical development. Furthermore, they can feature in the designs as either a substitute or compliment to traditional clinical trials. However, to utilize RWD and RWE appropriately and wisely, it is critical to apply rigorous statistical methodologies that enable the robustness of results to be characterized and ascertained. Several statistical methodologies including exact matching, propensity score methods, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons and meta-analysis have been proposed for analyzing RWD. Among them, propensity score method is one of the most commonly used methods for non-randomized trials with indirect comparison. Although massive methodologies and examples have been published and discussed since propensity score methods were introduced, systematic review and discussion of how to rigorously use propensity score methods in the practical clinical development is still deficient. This paper introduces commonly used and emerging propensity score methods with detailed discussions of their pros and cons. Three different case studies are presented to illustrate the practical considerations of utilizing propensity score methods in the study design and evaluation using real-world and historical data. Additional considerations including selection of patient populations, endpoints, baseline covariates, propensity score methods, sensitivity analysis and practical implementation flow in clinical development will be discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",32853779,

The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy  of monoclonal antibodies against the calcitonin generelated peptide  pathway drugs in chronic migraine through an adjusted indirect  treatment comparison, and to establish whether they can be considered  equivalent therapeutic alternatives in this pathology. METHOD: A bibliographic search of randomized clinical trials was performed in PubMed database on December 26, 2019. The inclusion criteria were phase II/III randomized clinical trials of  monoclonal antibodies against the calcitonin generelated peptide  pathway with similar population, length of follow-up and treatment  comparator. The reduction of at least 50% migraine-days/month was  selected as efficacy endpoint. Chronic migraine was defined as ≥ 15  headache days/month, of which ≥ 8 were migraine-days (event duration  ≥ 4 hours). Randomized clinical trials with different clinical chronic  migraine context and definition of disease were excluded. An indirect  treatment comparison was developed using Bucher's method. The  equivalent therapeutic alternatives positioning guide was used for the  evaluation of potentially equivalent alternatives. Delta value (Δ,  maximum difference as clinical criterion of equivalence) was calculated  as half of absolute risk reduction obtained in a meta-analysis of  randomized clinical trials included in indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: Thirty randomized clinical trials were found: erenumab (n =  12), fremanezumab (n = 7), galcanezumab (n = 10) and eptinezumab (n = 1). Three studies were selected: one of erenumab, one of  fremanezumab and another of eptinezumab.

OBJECTIVE: We indirectly compared the efficacy of OW semaglutide 1 mg vs once-daily (OD) empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, using individual patient data (IPD) and meta-regression methodology. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: IPD for patients with T2D receiving metformin monotherapy and randomized to OW semaglutide 1 mg (SUSTAIN 2, 3, 8 trials), or to OD empagliflozin 25 mg (PIONEER 2 trial) were included. Meta-regression analyses were adjusted for potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcomes were change from baseline to end-of-treatment (~1 year) in HbA1c (%-point) and body weight (kg). Responder outcomes and other clinically relevant efficacy measures were analyzed. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between OW semaglutide (n = 995) and empagliflozin (n = 410). Our analyses showed that OW semaglutide significantly reduced mean HbA1c and body weight vs empagliflozin (estimated treatment difference: -0.61%-point [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.72; -0.49] and -1.65 kg [95% CI: -2.22; -1.08], respectively; both P < 0.0001). Complementary analyses supported the robustness of these results. A significantly greater proportion of patients on OW semaglutide vs empagliflozin also achieved HbA1c targets and weight-loss responses.

Long-term KEYNOTE-052 data continue to demonstrate pembrolizumab's meaningful, durable, and well-tolerated antitumor activity. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine as first-line treatment for cisplatin-ineligible patients who have PD-L1-positive tumors from a US third-party healthcare payer's perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model containing 3 health states (progression-free, progressed, and death) was developed. A simulated treatment comparison and a network meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of pembrolizumab versus carboplatin-based chemotherapy. Overall survival, progression-free survival, time on treatment, adverse events, and utilities were modeled using the final analyses of the KEYNOTE-052 trial and 4 studies for carboplatin plus gemcitabine. Cost data were estimated using US standard sources and real-world data. Deterministic, probabilistic, and scenario analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Over 20 years, pembrolizumab resulted in a mean gain of 2.58 life-years, 2.01 quality-adjusted life-years, and additional costs of $158,561, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $78,925/quality-adjusted life-year compared with carboplatin plus gemcitabine.

Based on the ITCs, D-Rd was associated with a significantly lower risk of progression or death compared to VRd (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48, 0.98) and Vd (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.33, 0.69). In the absence of head-to-head trials comparing D-Rd to VRd or Vd, the present ITC may help inform treatment selection in transplant-ineligible patients with NDMM.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32804408,PMC7754114

In this study, the effectiveness of cladribine vs other approved drugs in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) was compared by matching RCT to observational data. METHODS: Data from the pivotal trial assessing cladribine tablets vs placebo (CLARITY) were propensity score matched to data from the Italian multicenter database i-MuST. This database included 3,150 patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2018 at 24 Italian MS centers who started a disease-modifying drug. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) over 2 years from treatment start and the 24-week confirmed disability progression were compared between patients treated with cladribine and other approved drugs (interferon, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, natalizumab, and dimethyl fumarate), with comparisons with placebo as a reference. Treatment effects were estimated by the inverse probability weighting negative binomial regression model for ARR and Cox model for disability progression. The treatment effect has also been evaluated according to baseline disease activity. RESULTS: All weighted baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. All drugs tested had an effect vs placebo close to that detected in the RCT. Patients treated with cladribine had a significantly lower ARR compared with interferon (relapse ratio [RR] = 0.48; p < 0.001), glatiramer acetate (RR = 0.49; p < 0.001), and dimethyl fumarate (RR = 0.6; p = 0.001); a similar ARR to that with fingolimod (RR = 0.74; p = 0.24); and a significantly higher ARR than natalizumab (RR = 2.13; p = 0.014), confirming results obtained by indirect treatment comparisons from RCTs (network meta-analyses). The relative effect of cladribine tablets 10 mg (cumulative dose 3.5 mg/kg over 2 years) was higher in patients with high disease activity vs all treatments except fingolimod and natalizumab. Effects on disability progression were largely nonsignificant, probably due to lack of power for such analysis. CONCLUSION: In patients with RRMS, cladribine tablets showed lower ARR compared with matched patients who started interferon, glatiramer acetate, or dimethyl fumarate; was similar to fingolimod; and was higher than natalizumab. The beneficial effect of cladribine tablets was generally amplified in the subgroup of patients with high disease activity. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that for patients with RRMS, cladribine-treated patients had lower ARR compared with interferon, glatiramer acetate, or dimethyl fumarate; similar ARR compared with fingolimod; and higher ARR compared with natalizumab.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32801167,PMC7641098

However, the relative efficacy of newer IAs is uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and safety of IAs for the management of DKA using an indirect treatment comparison (ITC). METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short-, rapid-, and long-acting IAs in patients with DKA. The primary outcomes of interest were time taken to normalize DKA and time taken to normalize blood glucose levels. The secondary outcomes of interest were the amount of insulin needed to normalize DKA, the length of hospital stay, and the number of hypoglycemic events in the intervention and comparator groups. Bayesian ITC was performed by using the gemtc package in the R program. Continuous outcomes are reported as mean difference (MD), and binary outcomes are reported as odds ratios (ORs), with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included RCTs. FINDINGS: Ten RCTs randomizing 435 participants to treatment were included in this ITC. A total of 5 interventions (lispro, glargine with regular insulin [RI], glulisine, aspart, and regular insulin) were compared for both safety and efficacy outcomes in DKA. Glargine co-administered with regular insulin showed superiority for clinical outcomes compared with regular insulin: consuming less time (MD, -3.1 h; 95% CrI, -7.9 to 1.8), amount of insulin required (MD, -32 U; 95% CrI, 83.0 to 18.0), and the length of hospitalization (MD, -0.82 day; 95% CrI, -2.7 to 1.0) to normalize DKA. However, these results were not statistically significant. Insulin aspart had fewer reports of hypoglycemic events (OR, 1.7; 95% CrI, 0.34 to 9.3) than regular insulin. IMPLICATIONS: Newer IAs were found to be equally effective and safe as regular insulin in the treatment of DKA. Thus, administering these IAs can be considered a safe and cost-effective alternative for DKA management in non-ICU settings. Cost-effective analysis of the newer IAs is needed because these agents are expensive compared with regular insulin.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32798057,

The paper, via a meta-analysis of effects of treatment modalities when administering chemo/radiotherapy, aims to systematically evaluate the effect of timing of chemo/radiotherapy and surgery. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search for clinical trials of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for patients with esophageal cancer. Using meta-analysis, we conducted direct and adjusted indirect comparisons of overall survival, complete resection rate (R0 resection), perioperative mortality, leakage rate and local recurrence in patients with resectable esophageal cancer. RESULTS: A total of 32 studies involving 7985 patients with esophageal cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Twenty-five randomized controlled studies indirectly compared neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy with surgery alone, while five non-randomized controlled studies and two randomized controlled studies directly compared neoadjuvant with adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, compared with surgery along with adjuvant therapy, showed a significant overall survival advantage in our pooled analysis (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79-0.98). Directly compared with adjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant therapy demonstrated a lower local recurrence rate (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.43-0.74) with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 1%). Neoadjuvant therapy, comparing to surgery with or without adjuvant therapy, showed a significantly higher R0 resection rate (OR 2.86; 95% CI 2.02-4.04) with moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 38%) and no significant differences in postoperative anastomotic leakage (P = 0.50). However, neoadjuvant therapy, compared with surgery adjuvant therapy, significantly increased perioperative mortality in both direct and indirect comparisons (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found that neoadjuvant therapy was associated with higher overall survival and R0 resection rate without increasing postoperative anastomotic leakage for patients with resectable esophageal cancer, whereas neoadjuvant therapy was associated with higher perioperative mortality after esophagectomy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32761259,

METHODS: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted on 29 July 2016 (updated 26 July 2018) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs assessing the treatment of newly-diagnosed advanced-stage HL with ABVD and BEACOPP (and their variants), and A+AVD. RESULTS: The SLR identified 62 RCTs and 42 non-RCTs. Five-year overall survival rates for ABVD and BEACOPP were 60-97% and 84-99%, and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 58-81% and 83-96%, respectively. Both regimens were associated with tolerability issues and side effects. Discontinuation or dose reduction of bleomycin resulted in fewer adverse events, without significantly affecting efficacy. A head-to-head trial demonstrated improved efficacy for A+AVD vs ABVD, with an acceptable tolerability profile. No data from head-to-head trials comparing A+AVD with BEACOPP were available, and an indirect treatment comparison was not feasible.

However, there has been no comparison of these antibiotics. METHODS: An electronic database search was performed, from inception to June 102,020. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) using different intravenous antibiotics (IVA) against the ICIs after craniotomy were considered. The primary outcome was the incidence rates of ICIs. An indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was conducted to compare the protective effect among the diverse antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent ICIs after craniotomy. Risk of potential bias was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 3214 patients after craniotomy in 11 studies were included, 159 patients experienced postoperative ICI, including 33 patients in the antibacterial group and 126 in the control group. The calculate results of meta-analysis showed that except fusidic acid, preoperative intravenous injection of cephalosporin, clindamycin, vancomycin, and penicillin can significantly reduce the incidence of ICI after craniotomy, and ITC showed there was no statistically significance difference in the rates of post craniotomy ICI between the various antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The current evidence shows that low-grade antibacterial drugs can be selected to prevent ICI after craniotomy, but this may be due to the limited number of studies per antibiotic. It still needs more high-quality, large sample RCT to confirm.

While uterotonic drugs are routinely recommended, there is ongoing debate on the ideal intervention to control uterine bleeding. This review aims to compare the use of non-pharmacologic treatments with peripartum hysterectomy in cases of life-threatening uncontrolled obstetric hemorrhage. The review's objective is to use a network meta-analysis to help prevent maternal deaths and rank the treatments according to success rates. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from January 2014 until December 2018. A second search was carried out in April 2019 before the final data analysis. Network meta-analysis allows for the calculation of the effect size between treatment groups through indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: We confirmed that balloon-assisted management is the best intervention for uncontrolled postpartum bleeding with pharmacologic treatment. This is followed by uterine artery embolization and surgical procedures, which can help avoid the need for a hysterectomy. The balloon tamponade demonstrated lower failure rate than the surgical procedure with odds ratio (OR) of 0.44 and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 0.50-30.54. Uterine artery embolization had a lower risk for hysterectomy than the surgical procedure group (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.22-2.50). CONCLUSION: For the quick treatment of postpartum bleeding, balloon tamponade is the best method for uncontrolled postpartum bleeding with pharmacologic treatment, followed by uterine artery embolization and surgical procedures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32727171,PMC7494765

METHODS: A cost-consequence analysis of the cost and clinical response of two treatment strategies was conducted over a 2-year time horizon. A hypothetical cohort of 10 patients with PsA initiated treatment with secukinumab 150mg (cohort A) or adalimumab 40mg (cohort B), respectively. Patients achieving clinical response (ACR20/50/70) at week 24 continued the initial treatment, while patients with inadequate response switched to secukinumab 300mg. Pharmacological costs were calculated based on SmPC (notified ex-factory price). The lowest cost of adalimumab biosimilar was considered. Data on clinical response were extracted from the two matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) published comparing secukinumab vs adalimumab. Results were expressed as the cost difference between the two cohorts (€, 2019) and were calculated for each clinical response criteria (ACR20/50/70) and for each MAIC. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact of potential discounts on the cost of adalimumab while maintaining the cost of secukinumab unchanged. RESULTS: Depending on the MAIC used, the cost of initiating biologic treatment for PsA with secukinumab 150mg was 18-33% lower than the one estimated for adalimumab 40mg, for ACR20, 18-28% for ACR50, and 16-23% for ACR70 response rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that it would be necessary a discount of 40-60%, 40-65% and 50-75% over the adalimumab cost to compensate for the differences in efficacy observed for ACR20/50/70, respectively, depending on the MAIC used. CONCLUSION: In patients with PsA, secukinumab could be considered a more efficient first-line biologic treatment compared to adalimumab, from the SNHS perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc",32693948,

Population adjustment methods relax this assumption using individual patient data from one or more studies. However, current matching-adjusted indirect comparison and simulated treatment comparison methods are limited to pairwise indirect comparisons and cannot predict into a specified target population. Existing meta-regression approaches incur aggregation bias. We propose a new method extending the standard NMA framework. An individual level regression model is defined, and aggregate data are fitted by integrating over the covariate distribution to form the likelihood. Motivated by the complexity of the closed form integration, we propose a general numerical approach using quasi-Monte-Carlo integration. Covariate correlation structures are accounted for by using copulas. Crucially for decision making, comparisons may be provided in any target population with a given covariate distribution. We illustrate the method with a network of plaque psoriasis treatments. Estimated population-average treatment effects are similar across study populations, as differences in the distributions of effect modifiers are small. A better fit is achieved than a random effects NMA, uncertainty is substantially reduced by explaining within- and between-study variation, and estimates are more interpretable.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",32684669,PMC7362893

This study makes these comparisons through the use of indirect treatment comparison (ITC) methods. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify RCTs that evaluated either one of perampanel or brivaracetam in the treatment of patients with focal-onset seizures. The Bucher ITC method was then used to compare efficacy and safety outcomes between perampanel and brivaracetam. Additional subgroup analyses, by levetiracetam usage (prior or concomitant), were conducted. RESULTS: Eight RCTs (four comparing perampanel to placebo, four comparing brivaracetam to placebo) were included in the ITC. For patients taking concomitant levetiracetam, perampanel showed a significantly better responder rate compared to brivaracetam [relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.62 (1.15, 5.99)]. For patients who had previously, or never, taken levetiracetam, there was no difference in the responder rate. In the overall population, both perampanel and brivaracetam were more effective than placebo in terms of responder rate, seizure freedom, and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure responder rate; however, for these outcomes, no evidence of a difference between perampanel and brivaracetam was found. Patients taking brivaracetam showed significantly less dizziness compared to patients taking perampanel. No differences for any other safety outcome were found. CONCLUSION: Perampanel and brivaracetam are effective for the adjunctive treatment of focal-onset seizures and display similar adverse event profiles. Perampanel demonstrated an improved focal-onset seizure responder rate compared to brivaracetam in patients taking concomitant levetiracetam. This may be due to the similarity in the mechanism of action between brivaracetam and levetiracetam.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32673969,

METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify direct comparisons (head-to-head randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) and indirect comparisons (network meta-analyses [NMAs]; indirect treatment comparisons; meta-analyses) in patients with COPD with moderate-to-very severe airflow limitation. Study/Analysis characteristics, eligibility criteria, patient characteristics, and overall conclusions were extracted from relevant publications. The review of indirect comparisons focused on NMAs reporting efficacy outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment (established durations of symptomatic studies in COPD recommended by regulators). RESULTS: Direct comparisons: Four RCTs that provided head-to-head comparisons of LAMA/LABA FDCs were identified, and these varied in their study design, included patient population and reported endpoints. While some differences in lung function outcomes were noted, where assessed, LAMA/LABA FDCs had comparable efficacy in improving symptoms, health status, exacerbations, and comparable safety profiles. However, the differences in study methodology and patient characteristics between these studies made it difficult to draw generalizable conclusions regarding the comparative effectiveness of LAMA/LABA FDCs from the direct comparisons alone. Indirect comparisons: Six NMAs were identified that reported indirect comparisons between LAMA/LABA FDCs; five of these were within the pre-defined scope of this review. Although the scope of each NMA varied, all five concluded that LAMA/LABA FDCs were generally comparable in terms of lung function improvements, patient-reported outcomes, and safety (where assessed). CONCLUSION: Although there were some inconsistencies between the outcomes of RCTs and NMAs for lung function, the totality of lung function, symptoms, exacerbations, and safety data suggests that currently available LAMA/LABA FDCs have comparable efficacy and safety in patients with COPD and moderate-to-very severe airflow limitation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",32669839,PMC7336124

In evidence synthesis, therapeutic options have to be compared despite the lack of head-to-head trials. Indirect comparisons are then widely used, although little is known about their performance in situations where cross-trial differences or effect modification are present. Methods. We contrast the matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), simulated treatment comparison (STC), and the method of Bucher using a simulation study. The different methods are evaluated according to their power and type I error rate as well as with respect to the coverage, bias, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the effect estimate for practically relevant scenarios using binary and time-to-event endpoints. In addition, we investigate how the power planned for the head-to-head trials influences the actual power of the indirect comparison. Results. Indirect comparisons are considerably underpowered. None of the methods had substantially superior performance. In situations without cross-trial differences and effect modification, MAIC and Bucher led to similar results, while Bucher has the advantage of preserving the within-study randomization. MAIC and STC could enhance power in some scenarios but at the cost of a potential type I error inflation. Adjusting MAIC and STC for confounders that did not modify the effect led to higher bias and RMSE. Conclusion. The choice of effect modifiers in MAIC and STC influences the precision of the indirect comparison. Therefore, a careful selection of effect modifiers is warranted. In addition, missed differences between trials may lead to low power and partly high bias for all considered methods, and thus, results of indirect comparisons should be interpreted with caution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",32659160,

DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis including aggregate results from reanalysed individual patient data. DATA SOURCES: Clinical study reports and aggregate results from reanalyses of individual patient data on key outcomes for rheumatoid arthritis provided by study sponsors for studies conducted up to 2017, and several databases and registries from inception up to February 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials investigating patient relevant outcomes in adults with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological medicines in combination with methotrexate after methotrexate failure for at least 24 weeks. RESULTS: 45 eligible trials were identified. Combining data from clinical study reports and aggregate results from reanalyses of individual patient data allowed extensive analyses yielding sufficiently similar populations and homogeneous study results for network meta-analyses, including up to 35 studies on eight biological medicines combined with methotrexate. These analyses showed few statistically significant differences between the combination treatments. For example, anakinra showed less benefit than almost all the other seven biological medicines regarding clinical remission or low disease activity (clinical disease activity index ≤2.8 or ≤10, respectively) and certolizumab pegol showed more harm than the other seven biological medicines regarding serious adverse events or infections. Some outcomes had very wide 95% confidence intervals, potentially implying unidentified differences between the eight biological medicines, but wide 95% confidence intervals were less prominent for low disease activity, serious adverse events, and infections. Owing to a lack of head-to-head trials, results were mainly based on indirect comparisons with a limited number of studies, and recently approved Janus kinase inhibitors could not be included. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with rheumatoid arthritis after methotrexate failure, only minor differences in benefits and harms were seen between biological medicines in combination with methotrexate. However, the analysis was hampered by a lack of long term direct comparisons. The substantial information gain achieved by the reanalysis of individual patient data calls for the routine availability of individual patient data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32636183,PMC7338922

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials followed by an indirect treatment comparison was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of the available fixed-ratio combinations. Main outcomes were glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change and target achievement [<6.5% and <7.0% (<48 and <53 mmol/mol)], fasting plasma glucose, self-monitored plasma glucose, body weight, and incidence and rate of hypoglycaemia. RESULTS: From 4850 abstracts screened, 78 qualified for full-text article review and two randomized controlled trials were included. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two studies. The mean difference at 26 weeks between IDegLira and iGlarLixi was -0.36 (95% credible intervals -0.58, -0.14) % [-3.9 (-6.3, -1.5) mmol/mol] for HbA1c and -1.0 (-1.6, -0.4) mmol/L for fasting plasma glucose. No significant differences were found in HbA1c target attainment, preprandial or postprandial self-monitored plasma glucose, or body weight change. Formal comparisons of hypoglycaemia were limited by differences in definitions between the studies: in non-sulphonylurea users, incidence was 28% for IDegLira ('confirmed' at ≤3.1 mmol/L); for iGlarLixi, incidence was 9% ('documented symptomatic' at <3.0 mmol/L). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this indirect treatment comparison using two studies suggest iGlarLixi and IDegLira appear to offer similar benefits for HbA1c target achievement. However, the findings suggest differences in other glycaemia results and hypoglycaemia, which may reflect differences in study design and titration approaches.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32627297,

Usually, this requires a connected network. A possible approach to link a disconnected network is to add evidence from nonrandomized comparisons, using propensity score or matching-adjusted indirect comparisons methods. However, nonrandomized comparisons may be associated with an unclear risk of bias. Schmitz et al. used single-arm observational studies for bridging the gap between two disconnected networks of treatments for multiple myeloma. We present a reanalysis of these data using component network meta-analysis (CNMA) models entirely based on RCTs, utilizing the fact that many of the treatments consisted of common treatment components occurring in both networks. We discuss forward and backward strategies for selecting appropriate CNMA models and compare the results to those obtained by Schmitz et al. using their matching method. CNMA models provided a good fit to the data and led to treatment rankings that were similar, though not fully equal to that obtained by Schmitz et al. We conclude that researchers encountering a disconnected network with treatments in different subnets having common components should consider a CNMA model. Such models, exclusively based on evidence from RCTs, are a promising alternative to matching approaches that require additional evidence from observational studies.

The research team wanted to determine whether or not psychological interventions are clinically effective and cost-effective in increasing self-management and improving glycaemic control. OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to determine the clinical effectiveness of psychological interventions for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and people with type 2 diabetes mellitus so that they have improved (1) glycated haemoglobin levels, (2) diabetes self-management and (3) quality of life, and fewer depressive symptoms. The second objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of psychological interventions. DATA SOURCES: The following databases were accessed (searches took place between 2003 and 2016): MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Web of Science, and Dissertation Abstracts International. Diabetes conference abstracts, reference lists of included studies and Clinicaltrials.gov trial registry were also searched. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic review, aggregate meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, individual patient data meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness modelling were all used. Risk of bias of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins JP, Altman DG, Gøtzsche PC, Jüni P, Moher D, Oxman AD, et al. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. BMJ 2011;343:d5928). DESIGN: Systematic review, meta-analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis and patient and public consultation were all used. SETTING: Settings in primary or secondary care were included. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents and children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and adults with types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus were included. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions used were psychological treatments, including and not restricted to cognitive-behavioural therapy, counselling, family therapy and psychotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glycated haemoglobin levels, self-management behaviours, body mass index, blood pressure levels, depressive symptoms and quality of life were all used as outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 96 studies were included in the systematic review (n = 18,659 participants). In random-effects meta-analysis, data on glycated haemoglobin levels were available for seven studies conducted in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 851 participants) that demonstrated a pooled mean difference of -0.13 (95% confidence interval -0.33 to 0.07), a non-significant decrease in favour of psychological treatment; 18 studies conducted in adolescents/children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 2583 participants) that demonstrated a pooled mean difference of 0.00 (95% confidence interval -0.18 to 0.18), indicating no change; and 49 studies conducted in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 12,009 participants) that demonstrated a pooled mean difference of -0.21 (95% confidence interval -0.31 to -0.10), equivalent to reduction in glycated haemoglobin levels of -0.33% or ≈3.5 mmol/mol. For type 2 diabetes mellitus, there was evidence that psychological interventions improved dietary behaviour and quality of life but not blood pressure, body mass index or depressive symptoms. The results of the network meta-analysis, which considers direct and indirect effects of multiple treatment comparisons, suggest that, for adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (7 studies; 968 participants), attention control and cognitive-behavioural therapy are clinically effective and cognitive-behavioural therapy is cost-effective. For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (49 studies; 12,409 participants), cognitive-behavioural therapy and counselling are effective and cognitive-behavioural therapy is potentially cost-effective. The results of the individual patient data meta-analysis for adolescents/children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (9 studies; 1392 participants) suggest that there were main effects for age and diabetes duration. For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (19 studies; 3639 participants), baseline glycated haemoglobin levels moderated treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS: Aggregate meta-analysis was limited to glycaemic control for type 1 diabetes mellitus. It was not possible to model cost-effectiveness for adolescents/children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and modelling for type 2 diabetes mellitus involved substantial uncertainty. The individual patient data meta-analysis included only 40-50% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that psychological treatments offer minimal clinical benefit in improving glycated haemoglobin levels for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, there was no evidence of benefit compared with control interventions in improving glycated haemoglobin levels for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. FUTURE WORK: Future work should consider the competency of the interventionists delivering a therapy and psychological approaches that are matched to a person and their life course.

Both can induce durable responses; however, cross-trial comparisons are difficult due to differences in study design. In this study, the registration trials of axi-cel and tisa-cel were compared using a matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). A MAIC was performed to adjust for differences in patient characteristics between trials. The estimates for the ZUMA-1 (axi-cel) trial were adjusted using patient-level data to match the study population in JULIET (tisa-cel) for key variables: International Prognostic Index), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, stage, refractoriness or relapsed disease, double/triple hit status, cell of origin, and number of prior lines of therapy. The endpoints analyzed were response, overall survival (OS), and adverse events. After adjusting for differences in patient characteristics between trials, axi-cel was associated with a greater objective response rate (relative risk [RR]=1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29 to 2.01) and complete response (RR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.27) than tisa-cel among patients who underwent infusion. The OS from infusion onward comparing axi-cel to tisa-cel had a hazard ratio of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.83). The indirect comparison showed a higher rate of grade 1 to 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in ZUMA-1 compared with JULIET (RR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.55 to 2.65) and similar rates of grade ≥3 CRS and neurologic events. In the absence of a direct head-to-head study, the MAIC statistical technique suggests axi-cel may have superior efficacy but a greater risk of grade 1 to 2 CRS. Future real-world studies can further inform the relative efficacy and safety of CAR T therapies in RR-LBCL.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",32561336,

METHODS: This study used matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to compare patient-reported outcomes from survey data evaluating rosacea treatments. Outcomes of interest included percentages of patients reporting concerns and side effects and measures of importance of the concerns and tolerability of the side effects. Patients in each analysis (MG vs AAF and MC vs AAF) were matched using stabilized inverse propensity scores. RESULTS: When compared to AAF, MG-treated patients more frequently reported concerns with treatment efficacy (54% vs 4%), application (7% vs 3%), and treatment side effects. MC-treated patients more frequently reported concerns with treatment efficacy (61% vs 5%) and dryness (8% vs 5%). AAF-treated patients more frequently reported concerns with cost of treatment compared with MG (7% vs 1%) and MC (9% vs 4%). Among patients reporting concerns, level of importance associated with these concerns was similar for AAF-treated patients compared with MG- and MC-treated patients. When compared to AAF-treated patients, MG-treated patients more frequently reported side effects of dryness (26% vs 15%) and uneven skin tone (3% vs 0%), and MC-treated patients more frequently reported side effects of burning (7% vs 3%), itching (7% vs 5%), and redness (7% vs 5%). MG- and MC-treated patients indicated greater intolerance for reported side effects than AAF-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: MG- and MC-treated patients more frequently reported treatment concerns and side effects than AAF-treated patients, and tolerability of those side effects was higher for patients treated with AAF. While treatment cost is a more frequent concern in patients treated with AAF, these patients less frequently reported concerns with treatment efficacy and reported similar or greater tolerance to side effects than patients treated with either MC or MG.

A secondary objective was to gauge the performance of the method relative to propensity score weighting (PSW). METHODS: A simulation study was designed based on an oncology example, where MAIC was used to account for differences between a contemporary trial in which patients had more favorable characteristics and a historical control. A variety of scenarios were then tested varying the setup of the simulation study, including violating the implicit or explicit assumptions of MAIC. RESULTS: Under ideal conditions and under a variety of scenarios, MAIC performed well (shown by a low mean absolute error [MAE]) and was unbiased (shown by a mean error [ME] of about zero). The performance of the method deteriorated where the matched characteristics had low explanatory power or there was poor overlap between studies. Only when important characteristics are not included in the matching did the method become biased (nonzero ME). Where the method showed poor performance, this was exaggerated if matching was also performed on the variance (ie, higher moments). Relative to PSW, MAIC provided similar results in most circumstances, although it exhibited slightly higher MAE and a higher chance of exaggerating bias. CONCLUSIONS: MAIC appears well suited to adjust for cross-trial comparisons provided the assumptions underpinning the model are met, with relatively little efficiency loss compared with PSW.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",32540233,

Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) are CAR T-cell therapies approved by regulatory bodies for certain patients with r/r DLBCL on the basis of demonstrated treatment effects in their pivotal single-arm trials, ZUMA-1 and JULIET, respectively. In the absence of head-to-head trials, the question of whether a valid indirect treatment comparison (ITC) between axi-cel and tisa-cel could be performed using existing evidence is of interest to patients, physicians, payers, and other stakeholders. This article addresses that question by summarizing the current evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies and discussing the challenges and limitations of potential analytical approaches associated with an ITC. Two ITC approaches attempting to adjust for cross-trial heterogeneity between ZUMA-1 and JULIET, matching-adjusted indirect comparison and regression-prediction model analysis, were evaluated. After evaluating the current clinical trial data and real-world evidence, and present and prior ITC analyses of axi-cel and tisa-cel, the authors conclude that a valid comparative analysis is not currently feasible. The substantial differences (e.g., timing of leukapheresis and enrollment, use of bridging chemotherapy [90% in JULIET vs. 0% in ZUMA-1], lymphodepleting regimens) between the two trials' designs and patient populations preclude a robust and reliable ITC. No other approaches are able to account for such differences. The current real-world data are still too immature to be used for ITCs. Thus, drawing conclusions from such ITCs should be avoided to prevent misinforming treatment choices or limiting patient access to effective treatment options. Additional data from ongoing or future real-world studies with appropriate statistical analyses are needed to provide insights into the comparative effectiveness and safety of these two treatments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",32524498,PMC7467403

We aim to implement NAVIGATE in geographically diverse EPI programmes in Ontario, Canada, evaluating implementation and its effect on fidelity to the EPI model, as well as individual-level outcomes (patient/family member-reported and interviewer-rated), system-level outcomes (captured in provincial administrative databases) and engagement of participants with lived experience. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multisite, non-randomised pragmatic hybrid effectiveness-implementation type III mixed methods study coordinated at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto. Implementation is supported by the Provincial System Support Program, a CAMH-based programme with provincial offices across Ontario, and Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes Ontario Mental Health at CAMH and the University of Toronto. The primary outcome is fidelity to the EPI model as measured using the First Episode Psychosis Services-Fidelity Scale. Four hundred participants in the EPI programmes will be recruited and followed using both individual-level assessments and health administrative data for 2 years following NAVIGATE initiation. People with lived experience will be engaged in all aspects of the project, including through youth and family advisory committees.

Although there have been many studies on statistical methods for IPD-NMAs, it is unclear whether there are statistical defects in published IPD-NMAs and whether the reporting of statistical analyses has improved. This study aimed to investigate statistical methods used and assess the reporting and methodological quality of IPD-NMAs. METHODS: We searched four bibliographic databases to identify published IPD-NMAs. The methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2 and reporting quality assessed based on PRISMA-IPD and PRISMA-NMA. We performed stratified analyses and correlation analyses to explore the factors that might affect quality. RESULTS: We identified 21 IPD-NMAs. Only 23.8% of the included IPD-NMAs reported statistical techniques used for missing participant data, 42.9% assessed the consistency, and none assessed the transitivity. None of the included IPD-NMAs reported sources of funding for trials included, only 9.5% stated pre-registration of protocols, and 28.6% assessed the risk of bias in individual studies. For reporting quality, compliance rates were lower than 50.0% for more than half of the items. Less than 15.0% of the IPD-NMAs reported data integrity, presented the network geometry, or clarified risk of bias across studies. IPD-NMAs with statistical or epidemiological authors often better assessed the inconsistency (P = 0.017). IPD-NMAs with a priori protocol were associated with higher reporting quality in terms of search (P = 0.046), data collection process (P = 0.031), and syntheses of results (P = 0.006).

While this mostly applies to population averaged results from analyses based on the all available data, it is also possible to conduct so-called personalized analyses based on a data subset whose observations resemble a particular patient for whom a decision is to be made. Claims data from statutory health insurance companies could provide necessary information for such personalized analyses. To derive treatment recommendations from them for a particular patient in everyday care, an automated, reproducible and efficiently programmed workflow would be required. We introduce the R-package SimBaCo (Similarity-Based Cohort generation) offering a simple, but modular, and intuitive framework for this task. With the six built-in R-functions, this framework allows the user to create similarity cohorts tailored to the characteristics of particular patients. An exemplary workflow illustrates the distinct steps beginning with an initial cohort selection according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. A plotting function facilitates investigating a particular patient's characteristics relative to their distribution in a reference cohort, for example the initial cohort or the precision cohort after the data has been trimmed in accordance with chosen variables for similarity finding. Such precision cohorts allow any form of personalized analysis, for example personalized analyses of comparative effectiveness or customized prediction models developed from precision cohorts. In our exemplary workflow, we provide such a treatment comparison whereupon a treatment decision for a particular patient could be made. This is only one field of application where personalized results can directly support the process of clinical reasoning by leveraging information from individual patient data. With this modular package at hand, personalized studies can efficiently weight benefits and risks of treatment options of particular patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",32470056,PMC7259608

METHODS: Placebo-controlled randomized AD clinical trials were systemically searched in public databases. Longitudinal placebo response (mean change from baseline in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale [ADAS-cog]) and the corresponding demographic information were extracted to establish a disease progression model. Covariate screening and subgroup analyses were performed to identify potential factors affecting the disease progression rate. RESULTS: A total of 134 publications (140 trials) were included in this model-based meta-analysis. The typical disease progression rate was 5.82 points per year. The baseline ADAS-cog score was included in the final model using an inverse U-type function. Age was found to be negatively correlated with disease progression rate. After correcting the baseline ADAS-cog score and the age effect, no significant difference in the disease progression rate was found between trials published before and after 2008 and between trials using an add-on design and those that did not use an add-on design. However, a significant difference was found among different trial regions. Trials in East Asian countries showed the slowest decline rate and the largest placebo effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our model successfully quantified AD disease progression by integrating baseline ADAS-cog score and age as important predictors. These factors and geographic location should be considered when optimizing future trial designs and conducting indirect comparisons of clinical outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",32456710,PMC7251914

OBJECTIVES: Conduct a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of the efficacy and safety of second-line cabozantinib and regorafenib in patients with advanced HCC and disease progression after prior sorafenib. METHODS: The CELESTIAL and RESORCE trials were used for indirect comparison of second-line cabozantinib and regorafenib in advanced HCC. Population-level data were available for RESORCE, individual patient data (IPD) for CELESTIAL. To align with RESORCE, the CELESTIAL population was limited to patients who received first-line sorafenib only. To minimize potential effect-modifying population differences, the CELESTIAL IPD were weighted to balance the distribution of clinically relevant baseline characteristics with those of RESORCE. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated for the matching-adjusted second-line CELESTIAL population and compared with those for RESORCE using weighted Kaplan-Meier curves and parametric modeling. Rates of grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) affecting > 5% of patients in any study arm were compared. RESULTS: In the matching-adjusted second-line populations (CELESTIAL, effective sample size = 266; RESORCE, n = 573), median (95% confidence interval) OS was similar for cabozantinib and regorafenib (11.4 [8.9-17.0] versus 10.6 [9.1-12.1] months; p = 0.3474, log-rank test). Median PFS was longer for cabozantinib than regorafenib (5.6 [4.9-7.3] versus 3.1 [2.8-4.2] months; p = 0.0005, log-rank test). There was a trend for lower rates of some grade 3/4 TEAEs with regorafenib than with cabozantinib, which may reflect the exclusion of sorafenib-intolerant patients from RESORCE but not from CELESTIAL, a difference that the MAIC methods could not remove. Only diarrhea rates were statistically significantly lower for regorafenib (p  ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib may achieve similar OS and prolonged PFS compared with regorafenib in patients with progressive advanced HCC after prior sorafenib.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",32424805,PMC7467441

Using longer follow-up and individual patient-data from KEYNOTE-045, this study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy or atezolizumab from a US payer perspective.Materials and methods: A partitioned-survival model was developed over a 20-year time horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy were extrapolated using a piecewise modelling approach, where patient-level data from KEYNOTE-045 were used for the initial period followed by parametric distributions. OS of atezolizumab was estimated by indirect treatment comparisons based on KEYNOTE-045 and IMvigor211. Different scenarios were explored in the absence of indirect comparisons on PFS and time-on-treatment (ToT) between pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. Drug acquisition/administration, disease management, adverse events, and terminal care costs were considered.Results: Compared with chemotherapy, pembrolizumab resulted in a mean gain of 1.33 life-years and 1.14 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and an incremental cost of $106,299, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $93,481/QALY gained. Pembrolizumab dominated atezolizumab in extending patients' life by 0.89 years and 0.76 QALYs, while reducing costs by $26,458. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness included survival extrapolation, OS hazard ratio of pembrolizumab vs. atezolizumab, and time horizon. Pembrolizumab had a 66% and 100% probability of being cost-effective vs. chemotherapy and atezolizumab, respectively, at a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.Limitations and conclusions: Uncertainties remain with extrapolated PFS and OS for pembrolizumab, OS indirect comparison, and ToT for atezolizumab. Despite these limitations, the model used robust methods to estimate key clinical endpoints with patient-level data from longer follow-up of KEYNOTE-045. Pembrolizumab dominates atezolizumab and is very likely cost-effective vs. chemotherapy in 2 L mUC at a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32412387,

Standard indirect comparisons use only aggregate data, under the assumption that there are no differences in effect-modifying variables between the trial populations. Population-adjusted indirect comparisons aim to relax this assumption by using individual patient data (IPD) from one trial to adjust for differences in effect modifiers between populations. At present, the most commonly used approach is matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), where weights are estimated that match the covariate distributions of the reweighted IPD to the aggregate trial. MAIC was originally proposed using the method of moments to estimate the weights, but more recently entropy balancing has been proposed as an alternative. Entropy balancing has an additional ""optimality"" property ensuring that the weights are as uniform as possible, reducing the standard error of the estimates. In this brief method note, we show that MAIC weights are mathematically identical whether estimated using entropy balancing or the method of moments. Importantly, this means that the standard MAIC (based on the method of moments) also enjoys the ""optimality"" property. Moreover, the additional flexibility of entropy balancing suggests several interesting avenues for further research, such as combining population adjustment via MAIC with adjustments for treatment switching or nonparametric covariate adjustment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",32395870,PMC7384548

The main objective of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of brodalumab, ixekizumab and secukinumab (three anti-interleukin-17 drugs) through adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs). METHODS: A search was carried out in June 2019, consulting these databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Studies including patients with moderate to severe psoriasis randomized to receive treatment with anti-interleukin-17 drugs or ustekinumab and with outcomes such as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 scores or static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA), were included. ITCs were carried out using the method proposed by Bucher et al RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Five randomized clinical trials were included. Analysing short-term data, there were no statistically significant differences between any pair of drugs in terms of PASI 75, PASI 100 or sPGA/sIGA 0/1. Analysing long-term data, statistically significant differences were only observed for secukinumab versus brodalumab in terms of PASI 100 (Absolute risk reduction -12.9%; 95% confidence interval -22.7% to -3.1%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The ITCs indicated no efficacy differences between anti-interleukin-17 drugs, except for secukinumab versus brodalumab 52-week analysis in terms of achieving PASI 100. All three drugs appear to act as equivalent clinical treatments for psoriasis.

Patients were often managed through routine surveillance. The phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) CheckMate 238 (238) demonstrated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab as an adjuvant treatment for melanoma in patients with stage IIIB/C or IV disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC], 7th edition) versus ipilimumab. The study objective was to estimate the relative efficacy, safety and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between nivolumab and routine surveillance. METHODS: Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) of nivolumab versus placebo were constructed using data from 238 and EORTC 18071. EORTC 18071 is a phase III RCT comparing ipilimumab with placebo in patients with resected stage IIIA-IIIC melanoma (AJCC, 6th edition). ITCs were performed using the Bucher comparison method and patient-level data for efficacy, safety and HRQoL. RESULTS: For the efficacy outcomes, nivolumab performed significantly better than placebo for recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.41, 0.68]) and distant metastases-free survival (HR: 0.59 [95% CI: 0.44, 0.78]). Safety ITCs indicated that patients receiving nivolumab had a greater hazard of experiencing an adverse event (AE) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, whereas there was a non-significant increased hazard of experiencing a serious AE. HRQoL ITCs showed comparable time to deterioration in 14 of the 15 QLQ-C30 domains; only the dyspnoea domain significantly favoured placebo. CONCLUSION: Nivolumab was associated with significantly improved efficacy outcomes versus placebo, whereas maintaining patient's overall HRQoL. Across the different analysis and populations, there was a high level of consistency in the effect size.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32380428,

METHODS: Propensity score (PS) methods were used to compare the efficacy of GOL IV 2 mg/kg and IFX 5 mg/kg using individual patient data (IPD) from the active arms of the phase 3 GO-ALIVE and ASSERT studies. Outcomes included the proportion of patients with a ≥ 20% improvement in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society Criteria (ASAS20), change from baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) score, and change from baseline in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels from weeks 4-52. RESULTS: Before matching, 105 patients were treated with GOL IV and 201 patients were treated with IFX. After matching on all covariates, 118 patients were included in the ASAS20 analysis, 96 in the BASFI analysis, and 160 in the CRP analysis. After matching, GOL IV showed significantly greater improvement in ASAS20 response than IFX for weeks 28-44 (e.g., OR = 9.05 [95% CI 1.62-50.4] at week 44) and was comparable in change from baseline in BASFI scores and CRP levels to IFX at all time points. Results were robust for inclusion of different sets of covariates in scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis of its kind to leverage clinical trial data to compare two biologics using PS methods in the treatment of active AS. Overall, GOL IV was associated with greater improvement in ASAS20 response than IFX in patients with AS at 28, 36, and 44 weeks of follow-up. Key Points • Although intravenous golimumab (GOL IV) and infliximab (IFX) are the only two IV-based tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors with demonstrated phase 3 clinical efficacy in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), no study has evaluated their comparative efficacy in a head-to-head trial. • Propensity score matching was used to derive indirect treatment comparisons of GOL IV and IFX for ≥ 20% in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society Criteria (ASAS20), change in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and change in C-reactive protein (CRP) using individual patient data from the GO-ALIVE and ASSERT phase 3 trials. • Propensity score matched indirect comparisons showed improved relative efficacy of GOL IV compared to IFX; after matching for up to 16 baseline covariates, GOL IV was associated with significantly greater odds of ASAS20 response at weeks 28, 36, and 44 than IFX as well as equivalent changes from baseline in BASFI and CRP. • This novel application of propensity score matching using data from phase 3 trials, the first analysis of its kind in AS, allowed adjustment for important imbalances in prognostic factors between trials to generate estimates of comparative efficacy between GOL IV and IFX in the absence of a head-to-head trial between these treatments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32367407,PMC7497341

Two approaches are frequently used in RRMM: network meta-analysis (NMA) and unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the relevance and credibility of published NMA and unanchored MAIC studies aiming to estimate the comparative efficacy of treatment options for RRMM. METHODS: Twelve relevant studies were identified in the published literature (n = 7) and from health technology assessment agencies (n = 5). Data from trials were extracted to identify between-trial differences that may have biased results. Credibility of the performed analyses and relevance of the research questions were critically appraised using the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) checklist and feedback based on consultations with clinical experts. RESULTS: The identified studies concerned NMAs of randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 7), unanchored MAICs (n = 4), or both types of analyses (n = 1). According to clinical expert consultation, the majority of the identified NMAs did not consider differences in prior therapies or treatment duration across the RCTs included in the analyses, thereby compromising the relevance. CONCLUSION: Based on the results and feedback from clinicians, the majority of NMAs did not consider prior treatment history or treatment duration, which resulted in nonrelevant comparisons. Furthermore, it may have compromised the credibility of the estimates owing to differences in effect-modifiers between the different trials. Pairwise comparisons by means of unanchored MAICs require clear justification given the reliance on non-randomized comparisons.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",32327161,PMC7480667

Existing studies could not meet the physician's need to select the most beneficial drugs for patients. 2) Principal component analysis is mainly used for scale analysis and has not been reported in clinical field. 3) When the results of the indirect meta-analysis were not satisfactory, no new solutions have been proposed in existing meta-analysis studies. METHODS: The overall process of this study is divided into 4 steps 1) literature search and data extraction; 2) principal component analysis; 3) common reference-based indirect comparison meta-analysis; 4) formal adjusted indirect comparison. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) experiments and eight long-term experiments were selected. The main influencing factors are mortality, 6-min walk distance (6MW), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), cardiac index (CI) by principal component analysis. There was no significant heterogeneity among the indirect meta-analysis of three drugs. But in the formal adjusted indirect comparison 1) the level of PAP of sildenafil group (60.5 ± 22.35, 220) was higher than that of the other three groups, placebo (53.5 ± 17.63, 507) (p < 0.001), ambrisentan (49.5 ± 15.08, 130) (p < 0.001), and bosentan (54.6 ± 118.41, 311) (p < 0.001); 2) the level of CI of sildenafil group (54 ± 18, 311) was higher than that of the other three groups, placebo (2.7 ± 1.09, 518) (p < 0.001), ambrisentan (2.5 ± 0.75, 130) (p < 0.001), and bosentan (2.5 ± 1.06, 333) (p < 0.001). In addition, sildenafil significantly improved the survival rate comparing with ambrisentan and bosentan. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that sildenafil might be more suitable for long-term treatment of PAH patients than ambrisentan and bosentan.

OBJECTIVE: To compare speed of onset and level of skin improvement between the interleukin (IL)-17A antagonist ixekizumab and the IL-23 p19 inhibitors guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Using data from controlled clinical trials, both adjusted indirect comparisons (AICs) and matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) were performed to determine the risk difference (RD) between ixekizumab and each IL-23 p19 inhibitor for the proportion of patients with ≥75%/90%/100% improvement compared with baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75/90/100) up to week 12. Placebo, etanercept, or ustekinumab were used as the comparator bridge. RESULTS: In all (M)AICs, RDs generally significantly favored ixekizumab over guselkumab (placebo bridge), tildrakizumab (placebo or etanercept bridge), and risankizumab (placebo or ustekinumab bridge) from the earliest assessment time (≥ week 2) to week 12 when considering PASI 75/90/100 responses. CONCLUSION: Ixekizumab provides a faster onset of effect and earlier clinical benefits than guselkumab, tildrakizumab, or risankizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, as reflected by higher levels of skin improvement than with these IL-23 p19 inhibitors up to week 12.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",32299269,

We conducted an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) between brigatinib and alectinib, with crizotinib as a common comparator, using a Bayesian model with non-informative prior distribution and assessed the between-study heterogeneity of the studies. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and efficacy was ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve values. ITC analysis showed that there were no significant differences in PFS between the brigatinib and alectinib arms. However, the SUCRA values revealed that alectinib ranked the highest by efficacy in the overall patient population, whereas brigatinib ranked the highest by efficacy in the CNS metastasis sub-group. Although there were no significant differences in the incidence of G3-5 adverse events between the brigatinib and alectinib arms in the overall patient population, the data were deemed insufficient for the CNS metastasis sub-group analysis. This study provides critical information to clinicians regarding the efficacy of brigatinib for ALK-p, ALK-inhibitor-naïve, advanced NSCLC patients, with and without CNS metastasis.

The phase III VISTA trial established the bortezomib dosing schedule for VMP. To mitigate bortezomib-associated toxicity, the phase III ALCYONE study of daratumumab plus VMP (D-VMP) versus VMP used modified bortezomib dosing. D-VMP demonstrated improved progression-free survival and overall response rate. Propensity score matching enables indirect comparisons by controlling for differences in baseline covariates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The efficacy and safety of both arms of ALCYONE were compared with VISTA VMP using propensity score matching. ALCYONE D-VMP and VMP patients were matched on selected baseline characteristics to VISTA VMP patients, reducing or eliminating systematic differences between treatment groups. RESULTS: After matching, median progression-free survival and overall response rate were comparable for ALCYONE VMP and VISTA VMP, and were significantly improved with ALCYONE D-VMP versus VISTA VMP. Rates of grade 3/4 peripheral sensory neuropathy were significantly lower for both arms of ALCYONE versus VISTA VMP, with or without matching. CONCLUSION: This propensity score matching analysis demonstrates significant improvements in efficacy with ALCYONE D-VMP versus VISTA VMP and a significantly lower incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy in both arms of ALCYONE versus VISTA VMP, although safety improvements may be due to different bortezomib administration routes (ALCYONE, subcutaneous; VISTA, intravenous).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32278674,

However, there is no consensus on optimal IAP levels to improve surgical outcomes. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to examine outcomes of low, standard, and high IAP among adults undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: An electronic database search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared outcomes of low, standard, and high IAP among adults undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to conduct pairwise meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons of the levels of IAP assessed across trials. RESULTS: The SLR and NMA included 22 studies. Compared with standard IAP, on a scale of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain), low IAP was associated with significantly lower overall pain scores at 24 h (mean difference [MD]: - 0.70; 95% credible interval [CrI]: - 1.26, - 0.13) and reduced risk of shoulder pain 24 h (odds ratio [OR] 0.24; 95% CrI 0.12, 0.48) and 72 h post-surgery (OR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.07, 0.65). Hospital stay was shorter with low IAP (MD: - 0.14 days; 95% CrI - 0.30, - 0.01). High IAP was not associated with a significant difference for these outcomes when compared with standard or low IAP. No significant differences were found between the IAP levels regarding need for conversion to open surgery; post-operative acute bleeding, pain at 72 h, nausea, and vomiting; and duration of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of published trials indicates that using low, as opposed to standard, IAP during laparoscopic cholecystectomy may reduce patients' post-operative pain, including shoulder pain, and length of hospital stay. Heterogeneity in the pooled estimates and high risk of bias of the included trials suggest the need for high-quality, adequately powered RCTs to confirm these findings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32253560,PMC7270984

METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out in Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL in October 2018. Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) and/or individual patient data meta-regression was used to connect ALTAIR (assessing IVT-AFL T&E) with other studies, adjusting for between-trial differences in baseline visual acuity and age or baseline visual acuity, age, and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) status. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results, including direct MAIC between IVT-AFL T&E (ALTAIR) and RBZ T&E (CANTREAT and TREX-AMD trials). RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (ALTAIR, VIEW 1 and 2, CATT, CANTREAT, and TREX) were included in the analysis. IVT-AFL T&E was assessed in one study, ALTAIR (n = 255), while RBZ T&E was assessed in two trials (n = 327). At 2 years, the median difference (95% credibility interval) between IVT-AFL T&E and RBZ T&E regarding the numbers of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters gained was not significant (M1: - 2.29 [- 8.10, 3.58]; M2: - 0.55 [- 6.34, 5.29]). IVT-AFL T&E was associated with significantly fewer injections than RBZ-T&E (M1: - 6.12 [- 7.60, - 4.65]; M2: - 5.93 [- 7.42, - 4.45]). Results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main scenarios. CONCLUSION: Patients with wAMD receiving an IVT-AFL T&E regimen achieved and maintained improvement in visual acuity with fewer injections over 2 years compared with RBZ T&E. IVT-AFL T&E may therefore serve as the optimal therapy for wAMD, as it was associated with clinical efficacy and minimized treatment burden.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",32222903,PMC7467478

To estimate the effects of sacubitril/valsartan had it been tested against a placebo control, we made indirect comparisons of the effects of sacubitril/valsartan with putative placebos in HF across the full range of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed patient-level data from the PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF trials (n = 13 194) and the CHARM-Alternative and CHARM-Preserved trials (n = 5050, candesartan vs. placebo). The rate ratio (RR) of sacubitril/valsartan vs. putative placebo was estimated by the product of the RR for sacubitril/valsartan vs. RASi and the RR for RASi vs. placebo. Total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death were analysed using the negative binomial method. Treatment effects were estimated using cubic spline methods by ejection fraction as a continuous measure. Across the range of LVEF, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with a RR 0.54 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.65] for the recurrent primary endpoint compared with putative placebo (P < 0.001). Treatment benefits of sacubitril/valsartan vs. putative placebo varied non-linearly with LVEF with attenuation of effects observed at LVEF above 60%. When analyzing data from PARADIGM-HF and CHARM-Alternative, the estimated risk reduction of sacubitril/valsartan vs. putative placebo was 48% (95% CI 35-58%); P < 0.001. When analyzing data from PARAGON-HF and CHARM-Preserved (with LVEF ≥ 45%), the estimated risk reduction of sacubitril/valsartan vs. putative placebo was 29% (95% CI 7-46%); P = 0.013. Across the full range of LVEF, consistent effects were observed for time-to-first endpoints: first primary endpoint (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.82), first HF hospitalization (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78), cardiovascular death (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.89), and all-cause death (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.96); all P < 0.02.

These trials included heterogeneous patient populations, which limits the use of standard network meta-analysis (NMA) for indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of relative efficacy. Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) aims to correct these cross-trial differences. We compared siponimod to other disease modifying treatments (DMTs) in SPMS using MAIC.Methods: Individual patient data (IPD) were available for siponimod (EXPAND), while only published summary data were available for IFNβ-1a (Nordic Study, SPECTRIMS, IMPACT), IFNβ-1b (North American Study, European Study) and natalizumab (ASCEND). MAICs were conducted between siponimod and the other DMTs by re-weighting patients in EXPAND based on logistic regression.Results: Siponimod was determined to be statistically significantly more effective for the outcome of time to 6 month confirmed disability progression (CDP) compared with 22 µg IFNβ-1a and 250 µg IFNβ-1b, and for the outcome of time to CDP-3 compared with 60 µg IFNβ-1a. Siponimod was numerically but not statistically superior for CDP in all other comparisons. For annualized relapse rate (ARR), with the exception of natalizumab, siponimod was numerically but not statistically superior to all comparators.Conclusions: EXPAND provides evidence of the efficacy of siponimod compared with placebo, and these MAICs complement this by demonstrating improved efficacy of siponimod relative to DMTs. Siponimod offers a significant therapeutic advance that may slow disease progression compared to other DMTs in an EXPAND-like population with secondary progressive disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",32220214,

Therefore, it is essential to assess between-trial heterogeneity to determine the suitability of synthesizing ITC results. We provide an illustrative case study in multiple sclerosis (MS) where we assess the feasibility of conducting ITCs between siponimod and interferon beta-1b (IFN β-1b) and between siponimod and ocrelizumab.Methods: We assessed the feasibility of conducting ITCs using standard unadjusted methods (e.g. Bucher or network meta-analysis [NMA]) as well as matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) using individual patient data (IPD) from the siponimod (EXPAND) trial, based on guidance from NICE. Time to confirmed disability progression (CDP) at 3 or 6 months was assessed.Results: Bucher ITCs and NMAs, which rely on summary-level data, were not able to account for important cross-trial differences. Comparisons between siponimod and IFN β-1b were feasible using MAIC; the HRs (95% CI) for CDP-6 and CDP-3 were 0.55 (0.33-0.91) and 0.82 (0.42-1.63), respectively. ITCs were not feasible between siponimod and ocrelizumab because study designs and patient populations were too dissimilar to conduct a reliable ITC.Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of conducting a detailed feasibility assessment before undertaking ITCs to illuminate when excessive between-trial heterogeneity would cause biased results. MAIC was performed for siponimod and IFN β-1b in the absence of a head-to-head trial and was considered a more valid approach than a traditional ITC to examine comparative effectiveness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",32216597,

Two high-dose, rapid-administration intravenous iron formulations are currently available in the UK: iron isomaltoside 1000/ferric derisomaltose (IIM) and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). An indirect treatment comparison (ITC) recently showed that improvement from baseline hemoglobin was significantly larger with IIM than FCM. The objective was to use the ITC findings to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of IIM versus FCM from the UK healthcare payer perspective.Methods: A patient-level simulation model was developed in R to evaluate the cost per patient experiencing hematological response with IIM versus FCM. The model generated a simulated cohort from parametric distributions of baseline hemoglobin and bodyweight. Changes in hemoglobin were modeled based on data from the ITC, covaried with baseline hemoglobin based on patient-level data from a randomized controlled trial. Posological models of the iron formulations were developed based on the summaries of product characteristics. UK-specific costs were based on healthcare resource groups.Results: The proportion of patients experiencing hematological response was 9.0% higher with IIM relative to FCM (79.0% versus 70.0%), based on modeling of clinically realistic, correlated distributions of baseline hemoglobin and change from baseline hemoglobin. The mean number of infusions needed to administer the required dose was 1.92 with FCM, versus 1.38 with IIM, resulting in costs of £637 and £457 per treated patient with FCM and IIM respectively, corresponding to respective costs of £910 and £579 per responder.Conclusions: The analysis showed that using IIM rather than FCM in patients with IDA was dominant and would reduce the number of iron infusions required to correct iron deficiency, thereby reducing the costs associated with IDA treatment and simultaneously increasing the proportion of patients with IDA experiencing a clinically meaningful hematological response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",32208038,

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of BRX compared with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for PPD. METHODS: We projected costs (2018 U.S. dollars) and health (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) for mothers treated with BRX or SSRIs and their children. A health state transition model projected clinical and economic outcomes for mothers based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, from a U.S. payer perspective. The modeled population consisted of adult patients with moderate to severe PPD, similar to BRX clinical trial patients. Short-term efficacy for BRX and SSRIs came from an indirect treatment comparison. Long-term efficacy outcomes over 4 weeks, 11 years (base case), and 18 years were based on results from an 18-year longitudinal study. Maternal health utility values came from analysis of trial-based short-form 6D responses. Other inputs were derived from the literature. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for BRX versus SSRIs was $106,662 per QALY gained over an 11-year time horizon. Drug and administration costs for BRX averaged $38,501, compared with $25 for SSRIs over the studied time horizon. Maternal total direct medical costs averaged $65,908 in the BRX arm, compared with $73,653 in the SSRI arm. BRX-treated women averaged 6.230 QALYs compared with 5.979 QALYs for the SSRI arm. Adding partner costs and utilities in a sensitivity analysis further favored BRX. Results were sensitive to the severity of PPD at baseline and the model time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that BRX was cost-effective at the $150,000-per-QALY threshold with 58% probability. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis using a state transition model showed BRX to be a cost-effective therapy compared with SSRIs for treating women with PPD.

However, no direct clinical trials have been carried out to compare the two agents. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were performed to indirectly compare the efficacy and safety of decitabine and azacitidine in elderly AML patients. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library through May 14, 2019. Randomized controlled trials on elderly AML patients comparing the efficacy and safety between decitabine and azacitidine, or comparing one of HMAs to standard supportive care or placebo were selected. The major outcomes of interest were performed with methods of adjusted indirect comparison and the fixed effect model. RESULTS: Only three RCTs including a total number of 1086 patients were identified. Direct comparisons showed that azacitidine significantly reduced mortality (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97) while decitabine was not significantly associated with lower mortality (RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02) compared to the conventional care regimen (CCR). In addition, for the indirect method, azacitidine significantly reduced mortality compared to decitabine (RR = 0.83 95% CI 0.77-0.90) and was more likely to improve complete response (CR) (RR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.17-2.35, low-certainty evidence). No statistical significance was found for the other studied outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to CCR, decitabine and azacitidine can promote studied outcomes in elderly AML patients. Indirect evidence with low certainty was used to compare these two agents.

METHODS: Treatment effects, as measured by the 1-year reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP), were estimated with an adjusted indirect treatment comparison. Evidence from randomized clinical trials was identified for four different MIGS methods. A disease-transition model was developed by capturing clinically relevant POAG stages and the expected natural disease evolution. Outcomes of the disease-transition model were the comparative utility [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)], cost and cost-utility of included strategies in a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: Estimated 1-year IOP reductions were: cataract surgery - 2.05 mmHg (95% CI - 3.38; - 0.72), one trabecular micro-bypass stent - 3.15 mmHg (95% CI - 5.66; - 0.64), two trabecular micro-bypass stents - 4.85 mmHg (95% CI - 7.71; - 1.99) and intracanalicular scaffold - 2.25 mmHg (95% CI - 4.87; 0.37). Discounted outcomes from the disease-transition model appraised the strategy of two trabecular micro-bypass stents with cataract surgery in the moderate POAG stage as the one providing the greatest added value, with 10,955€ per additional QALY. Improved outcomes were seen when assessing MIGS in the moderate POAG stage. CONCLUSIONS: When indirectly comparing alternative MIGS methods combined with cataract surgery, the option of two trabecular micro-bypass stents showed both a superior efficacy and long-term cost-utility from a German perspective. Moreover, outcomes of the disease-transition model suggest POAG patients to beneficiate the most from an earlier intervention in the moderate stage contrary to waiting until an advanced disease is present.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32185590,PMC7242241

PURPOSE: This systematic review with meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of basic treatment combined with fecal microbiota transplantation or mixed probiotics therapy in relieving mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane libraries (updated September 2019) were searched to identify randomized, placebo-controlled, or head-to-head trials assessing fecal microbiota transplantation or probiotic VSL#3 as induction therapy in active ulcerative colitis. We analyze data using the R program to obtain evidence of direct comparison and to generate intermediate variables for indirect treatment comparisons. RESULTS: Seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were used as the sources of the induction data. All treatments were superior to placebo. In terms of clinical remission and clinical response to active ulcerative colitis, direct comparisons showed fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 3.47, 95% CI = 1.93-6.25) (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.18-5.21) and mixed probiotics VSL#3 (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.49-3.88) (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.53-6.25) to have better effects than the placebo. Indirect comparison showed fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic VSL#3 did not reach statistical significance either in clinical remission (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.70-2.06) or clinical response (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.62-1.45). In terms of safety, fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.51-2.61) and VSL #3 (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.33-2.49) showed no statistically significant increase in adverse events compared with the control group. In terms of serious adverse events, there was no statistical difference between the fecal microbiota transplantation group and the control group (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.46-3.57). The probiotics VSL#3 seems more safer than fecal microbiota transplantation, because serious adverse events were not reported in the VSL#3 articles. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal microbiota transplantation or mixed probiotics VSL#3 achieved good results in clinical remission and clinical response in active ulcerative colitis, and there was no increased risk of adverse reactions. There was no statistical difference between the therapeutic effect of fecal microbiota transplantation and that of mixed probiotics VSL#3. However, the use of fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics still has many unresolved problems in clinical applications, and more randomized controlled trials are required to confirm its efficacy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32182248,PMC7077802

A technique of ePIE with multiple axial intensity constraints, which is called MAIC-PIE, is proposed to drastically improve the convergence speed and reduce the calculation time. This technique requires that the diffracted light from the sample is propagated to the multiple individual axial planes, which can be achieved by using the beam splitter and multiple CCDs. In this technique, an additional intensity constraint is involved in the iterative process that makes for building the reasonable guesses of the probe and object in the first few iterations and accelerating the convergence. Simulations and experiments have verified that MAIC-PIE behaves good performance with fast convergence. The great performance and limited computational complexity make it a very attractive and promising technique for ptychographic imaging.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",32122024,

Researchers may use the adjusted indirect comparison based on the Bucher method (AIC) or the matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). While the Bucher method may provide biased results when included trials differ in baseline characteristics that influence the treatment outcome (treatment effect modifier), this issue may be addressed by applying the MAIC method if individual patient data (IPD) for at least one part of the AIC is available. Here, IPD is reweighted to match baseline characteristics and/or treatment effect modifiers of published data. However, the MAIC method does not provide a solution for situations when several common comparators are available. In these situations, assuming that the indirect comparison via the different common comparators is homogeneous, we propose merging these results by using meta-analysis methodology to provide a single, potentially more precise, treatment effect estimate. This paper introduces the method to combine several MAIC networks using classic meta-analysis techniques, it discusses the advantages and limitations of this approach, as well as demonstrates a practical application to combine several (M)AIC networks using data from Phase III psoriasis randomized control trials (RCT).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",32115845,

The objective of this roundtable was to discuss the limitations of these single-arm studies, to analyse available and acceptable solutions in order to propose guidelines for their conduct and assessment. Single-arm studies themselves are intrinsically inappropriate for demonstrating the benefit of a new treatment because it is impossible to infer the benefit from a value obtained under treatment without knowing what it would have been in the absence of the new treatment. The implication is that comparison with other data is necessary. However this comparison has limitations due to (1) the post hoc choice of the reference used for comparison, (2) the confusion bias for which an adjustment approach is imperative and, (3) the other biases, measure and attrition among others. When these limitations are taken into account this should, first and foremost, lead to the conduct of externally controlled trials instead of single-arm trials as is proposed by the latest version of ICH E10. Moreover, the external control must be formalised in the study protocol with a priori selection of both the reference control and the formal method of comparison: test in relation to a standard, adjustment on individual data, a synthetic control group or matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC). Lastly, externally controlled studies must be restricted to situations where randomisation is infeasible. To be acceptable, these studies must be able to guarantee freedom from residual confusion bias, which is only truly acceptable if the observed effect is dramatic and the usual course of the disease is highly predicable.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",32063399,

Very-late (>1-year) stent-related MACE have not been well described. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency and predictors of very-late stent-related events or MACE by stent type. METHODS: Individual patient data from 19 prospective, randomized metallic stent trials maintained at a leading academic research organization were pooled. Very-late MACE (a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction [MI], or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [ID-TLR]), and target lesion failure (cardiac death, target-vessel MI, or ID-TLR) were assessed within year 1 and between 1 and 5 years after PCI with bare-metal stents (BMS), first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES1) and second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES2). A network meta-analysis was performed to evaluate direct and indirect comparisons. RESULTS: Among 25,032 total patients, 3,718, 7,934, and 13,380 were treated with BMS, DES1, and DES2, respectively. MACE rates within 1 year after PCI were progressively lower after treatment with BMS versus DES1 versus DES2 (17.9% vs. 8.2% vs. 5.1%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Between years 1 and 5, very-late MACE occurred in 9.4% of patients (including 2.9% cardiac death, 3.1% MI, and 5.1% ID-TLR). Very-late MACE occurred in 9.7%, 11.0%, and 8.3% of patients treated with BMS, DES1, and DES2, respectively (p < 0.0001), linearly increasing between 1 and 5 years. Similar findings were observed for target lesion failure in 19,578 patients from 12 trials. Findings were confirmed in the network meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale, individual patient data pooled study, very-late stent-related events occurred between 1 and 5 years after PCI at a rate of ∼2%/year with all stent types, with no plateau evident. New approaches are required to improve long-term outcomes after PCI.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",32057373,

The primary efficacy endpoint was annual exacerbation rate (AER). A subgroup analysis by blood eosinophil count was also performed. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of any adverse events (AAEs). The results demonstrate that there was no significant difference in the AER between dupilumab and benralizumab in overall patients and the subgroup with the blood eosinophil count of <150. However, the AER was significantly lower in the dupilumab group than in the benralizumab group in the subgroup with a blood eosinophil count of ≥150 but <300, and ≥300 with the rate ratio and 95% credible interval of 0.51 (0.29-0.92) and 0.58 (0.39-0.84), respectively. There was no significant difference in the AAEs between the dupilumab and benralizumab groups.

METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons of four-week PASI-75 responses of Cal/BD foam were performed versus 12-week responses of methotrexate, acitretin, fumaric acid esters (FAE) and 16-week responses of apremilast. Analyses took a payer perspective and included drug, physician visit and monitoring costs. RESULTS: In all countries, Cal/BD foam generated the lowest cost per responder (CPR). Against methotrexate, apremilast and acitretin, Cal/BD foam generated response for less than €190 in Italy, €195 in Portugal, €216 in Greece, £218 in the United Kingdom, €250 in Belgium, €319 in Spain, and €359 in the Netherlands.

The goal of this article was to assess the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in Chinese patients with AF from the perspective of the Chinese health care system. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus rivaroxaban. Clinical events were modeled for a lifetime horizon, based on clinical efficacy data from indirect treatment comparisons. The weighted average of the most recent prices of these 2 drugs was used as the drug acquisition cost. Other costs, including follow-up costs and event costs, were collected by using a survey from a panel of local experts. Utility inputs (health state utilities, clinical event disutilities, and event history utility) were obtained from published literature. Sensitivity analyses that included scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the robustness of the economic model. FINDINGS: Over a lifetime, patients treated with dabigatran experienced fewer ischemic strokes (2.14 dabigatran vs 2.61 rivaroxaban) and fewer intracranial hemorrhage (0.48 vs 0.94) per 100 patient-years. In the base case analysis, dabigatran had an incremental cost of ¥28,128 but with higher life years (10.38 vs 10.14) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (7.95 vs 7.70). The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥112,910 per QALY gained and net monetary benefit of ¥12,214 versus rivaroxaban showed that dabigatran was a cost-effective alternative to rivaroxaban. Extensive sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust over a wide range of inputs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that dabigatran was cost-effective in 84.2% of the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations compared with rivaroxaban. IMPLICATIONS: Dabigatran reduced the occurrence of clinical events and increased QALYs compared with rivaroxaban. The use of dabigatran for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism is a cost-effective option compared with rivaroxaban among patients with AF in China.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",31932080,

However, it can be argued that NICE has developed a more prominent international profile than most in their use of economics. After 20 years of operation, it is timely to assess the extent of NICE's achievements, including the economic evaluation methods it has used and its willingness to adapt these as new evaluative approaches emerge and when NICE faces particular policy challenges. This paper considers some of the important policy and contextual developments in the UK over the last 20 years and how these may have shaped NICE's approach to economic evaluation. It then assesses key areas of NICE methods, including perspective, defining benefits, modelling and uncertainty. The paper concludes that NICE has provided important support for the development of new methods, in particular through its role in identifying priorities for methods research funding and its sponsorship of the NICE Decision Support Unit. However, potentially important developments in methods in a number of important areas have yet to be formally included in NICE's methods guidance and this should be addressed in the Institute's 2019/2020 methods review.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",31930460,

Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen and devise a new approach, meta-analysis by information content (MAIC) to systematically combine our results with prior evidence for influenza host factors. MAIC out-performs other meta-analysis methods when using our CRISPR screen as validation data. We validate the host factors, WDR7, CCDC115 and TMEM199, demonstrating that these genes are essential for viral entry and regulation of V-type ATPase assembly. We also find that CMTR1, a human mRNA cap methyltransferase, is required for efficient viral cap snatching and regulation of a cell autonomous immune response, and provides synergistic protection with the influenza endonuclease inhibitor Xofluza.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",31919360,PMC6952391

The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head, which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. This is the baseline update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2017, in preparation for this Cochrane Review becoming a living systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biologics for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: We updated our research using the following databases to January 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and the conference proceedings of a number of dermatology meetings. We also searched five trials registers and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports (until June 2019). We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant RCTs. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to placebo or another active agent. The primary outcomes of this review were: the proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 at induction phase (from 8 to 24 weeks after the randomisation), and the proportion of participants with serious adverse effects (SAEs) at induction phase. We did not evaluate differences in specific adverse effects. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Several groups of two review authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the PASI 90 score) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse effects). We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes, according to GRADE, as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. MAIN RESULTS: We included 140 studies (31 new studies for the update) in our review (51,749 randomised participants, 68% men, mainly recruited from hospitals). The overall average age was 45 years; the overall mean PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo-controlled (59%), 30% were head-to-head studies, and 11% were multi-armed studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. We have assessed a total of 19 treatments. In all, 117 trials were multicentric (two to 231 centres). All but two of the outcomes included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation). We assessed many studies (57/140) as being at high risk of bias; 42 were at an unclear risk, and 41 at low risk. Most studies (107/140) declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 22 studies did not report the source of funding. Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90. At class level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents. At drug level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, infliximab, all of the anti-IL17 drugs (ixekizumab, secukinumab, bimekizumab and brodalumab) and the anti-IL23 drugs (risankizumab and guselkumab, but not tildrakizumab) were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than ustekinumab and 3 anti-TNF alpha agents: adalimumab, certolizumab and etanercept. Adalimumab and ustekinumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than certolizumab and etanercept. There was no significant difference between tofacitinib or apremilast and between two conventional drugs: ciclosporin and methotrexate. Network meta-analysis also showed that infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, guselkumab, secukinumab and brodalumab outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in reaching PASI 90. The clinical effectiveness for these seven drugs was similar: infliximab (versus placebo): risk ratio (RR) 29.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 19.94 to 43.70, Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) = 88.5; moderate-certainty evidence; ixekizumab (versus placebo): RR 28.12, 95% CI 23.17 to 34.12, SUCRA = 88.3, moderate-certainty evidence; risankizumab (versus placebo): RR 27.67, 95% CI 22.86 to 33.49, SUCRA = 87.5, high-certainty evidence; bimekizumab (versus placebo): RR 58.64, 95% CI 3.72 to 923.86, SUCRA = 83.5, low-certainty evidence; guselkumab (versus placebo): RR 25.84, 95% CI 20.90 to 31.95; SUCRA = 81; moderate-certainty evidence; secukinumab (versus placebo): RR 23.97, 95% CI 20.03 to 28.70, SUCRA = 75.4; high-certainty evidence; and brodalumab (versus placebo): RR 21.96, 95% CI 18.17 to 26.53, SUCRA = 68.7; moderate-certainty evidence. Conservative interpretation is warranted for the results for bimekizumab (as well as tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters, and methotrexate), as these drugs, in the NMA, have been evaluated in few trials. We found no significant difference between any of the interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAE analyses were based on a very low number of events with low to very low certainty for just under half of the treatment estimates in total, and moderate for the others. Thus, the results have to be viewed with caution and we cannot be sure of the ranking. For other efficacy outcomes (PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1) the results were very similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for several of the interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, guselkumab, secukinumab and brodalumab were the best choices for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence (low-certainty evidence for bimekizumab). This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficient for evaluation of longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 45 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly-reported safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. Indeed, we found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs, but the evidence for all the interventions was of very low to moderate quality. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the treatments included in this review, it will also be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies. In terms of future research, randomised trials comparing directly active agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between conventional systemic and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve participants, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the interventions and the comparative safety of different agents. Editorial note: This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",31917873,PMC6956468

There is no direct evidence on the comparative effectiveness of RF ablation with Ablation Index and cryoballoon (CB). The objective of the present study was to conduct a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) using individual patient-level data (IPD) to compare the effectiveness of RF ablation with Ablation Index to that of CB on recurrence of atrial arrhythmias 12 months after catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF). METHODS: Individual patient-level data for RF ablation with Ablation Index were obtained from two studies: Solimene et al. [J Interv Card Electrophysiol 54(1):9-15, 2019] and Hussein et al. [J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 28(9):1037-1047, 2017]. Comparable CB studies identified from a systematic literature review were pooled. Prognostic variables for adjustment were ranked a priori by several practicing electrophysiologists. In the absence of a common treatment arm between the Ablation Index and CB studies, an unanchored MAIC was conducted. Primary analysis compared the Solimene et al. study to pooled CB studies. A secondary analysis compared pooled RF ablation with Ablation Index studies to pooled CB studies. Several scenario and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Primary analyses showed statistically significant reductions in the rate of arrhythmia recurrence with RF ablation with Ablation Index compared to CB in unmatched, unadjusted (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.95) and matched (0.42, 0.21-0.86) analyses. Greater reductions in the rate of arrhythmia recurrence that favored RF ablation with Ablation Index were observed after matching and adjusting for age (0.41, 0.20-0.85), age and left ventricular ejection fraction (0.37, 0.16-0.88), and age, sex, and left ventricular ejection fraction (0.30, 0.13-0.71). Secondary and sensitivity analyses showed similar reductions. CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation with Ablation Index was associated with reductions in recurrence of atrial arrhythmias at 12 months compared to CB in unmatched and unadjusted, matched, and matched and adjusted comparisons.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",31865547,PMC7004430

Hence, monitoring the efficacy of antimalarial drugs is a key component of malaria control and elimination. The published randomized trials that assessed comparisons of ACTs for treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria reported conflicting results in treatment efficacy. A network meta-analysis is an extension of pairwise meta-analysis that can synthesize evidence simultaneously from both direct and indirect treatment comparisons. The objective was to synthesize evidence on the comparative efficacy of antimalarial drugs for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Asian region. METHODS: Relevant randomized trials that assessed efficacy of antimalarial drugs for patients having uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Asian region were searched in health-related databases. We evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Main outcome was treatment success at day 28 as determined by the absence of parasiteamia. We performed network meta-analysis of the interventions in the trials, and assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Seventeen randomized trials (n = 5043) were included in this network meta-analysis study. A network geometry was formed with 14 antimalarial treatment options such as artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artemisinin-piperaquine, artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ), artesunate-chloroquine, artesunate-mefloquine home treatment, artesunate-mefloquine 2-day course, artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, chloroquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine home treatment, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 4-day course, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and added artesunate, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. A maximum number of trials included was DHP compared to ASMQ (n = 5). In general, DHP had better efficacy than AL at day 28 (DHP vs AL: OR 2.5, 95%CI:1.08-5.8). There is low certainty evidence due to limited number of studies and small trials. DISCUSSION/ CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the superiority of DHP (3-day course) to AL and other comparator ACTs are with the overall low/very low quality of evidence judgements. Moreover, one drug regimen is better than another is only if current drug-resistance patterns are at play. For example, the AL might be better than DHP in areas where both artemisinin and piperaquine resistance patterns are prevalent. For substantiation, well-designed larger trials from endemic countries are needed. In the light of benefit versus harm concept, future analysis with safety information is recommended.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",31856172,PMC6922314

METHODS AND RESULTS: MEDLINE, Cochrane, ISI Web of Sciences, and SCOPUS were searched for randomized or adjusted observational studies comparing NOACs vs. VKAs for stroke prevention in AF patients ≥75 years. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes of this meta-analysis were the composite of stroke and systemic embolism (SSE) and major bleedings, respectively. Other secondary outcomes were also analysed. The analysis included 22 studies enrolling 440 281 AF patients ≥ 75 years. The risk of SSE was significantly lower with NOACs vs. VKAs [hazard ratio (HR) 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.89], whereas no differences were found for major bleedings (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.85-1.05). NOACs reduced the risk of intracranial bleeding (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.38-0.58), haemorrhagic stroke (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.48-0.79) and fatal bleeding (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.30-0.72) but increased gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.30-1.65), compared to VKAs. The adjusted indirect comparison showed no significant differences in term of SSE between NOAC agents.

METHODS: Patient-level data from the SPARTAN study [apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus placebo + ADT] and aggregate published data from the PROSPER study (enzalutamide + ADT versus placebo + ADT) were used. Anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted by weighting patients' baseline characteristics from SPARTAN to match aggregated baseline characteristics in PROSPER. Odds ratios (ORs) of reported adverse events (AEs) and baseline-to-follow-up least squares mean differences in HRQoL [measured with Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) score] with 95% credible intervals were re-estimated for SPARTAN arms using weighted population and indirectly compared with those in PROSPER through a Bayesian framework. Events of special interest included fatigue, hot flush, nausea, diarrhea, hypertension, falls, dizziness, decreased appetite, arthralgia, asthenia and headache. In addition, any AEs and serious AEs were explored. RESULTS: Of 1207 SPARTAN patients, 1171 were matched to 1401 PROSPER patients. Relative to enzalutamide, apalutamide demonstrated better tolerability as evidenced by the highest probability of reduced occurrence of fatigue [p(OR < 1) = 99.5%], hypertension [p(OR < 1) = 99.2%], decreased appetite [p(OR < 1) = 98.3%], fall [p(OR < 1) = 90.3%], headaches [p(OR < 1) = 86.7%], and nausea [p(OR < 1) = 80.0%]. The probabilities of reduced occurrence of any AEs and SAEs with apalutamide versus enzalutamide were 66.9% and 90.9%, respectively. Relative to enzalutamide, apalutamide treatment was associated with a higher probability of a better HRQoL based on the FACT-P total score [p(diff > 0) = 73.1%]. The probability of a better HRQoL with apalutamide versus enzalutamide was highest for the physical [p(diff > 0) = 97.3%] and functional [p(diff > 0) = 86.7%] wellbeing subscales, and the pain-related subscale [p(diff > 0) = 90.1%].

Hazard ratios (HRs) for MFS and OS were re-estimated for SPARTAN using weighted Cox proportional hazards models and indirectly compared with those of PROSPER using a Bayesian network meta-analysis. RESULTS: From the SPARTAN population (N = 1207), a total of 1171 patients were matched to the PROSPER population (N = 1401). The recalculated HRs (95% confidence interval) for apalutamide versus ADT based on the reweighted SPARTAN data to mimic the PROSPER patient population were 0.26 (0.21; 0.33) for MFS and 0.62 (0.41; 0.94) for OS. MAIC-based HRs (95% credible interval) for apalutamide versus enzalutamide were 0.91 (0.68; 1.22) for MFS and 0.77 (0.46; 1.30) for OS. The Bayesian probabilities of apalutamide being more effective than enzalutamide were 73.6% for MFS and 83.5% for OS. CONCLUSIONS: MAIC results suggest that nmCRPC patients treated with apalutamide have a higher probability of a more favorable MFS and OS compared with those treated with enzalutamide.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",31813086,PMC6979453

Although MCL usually responds well to initial treatment with chemotherapy-based regimens, the disease often relapses or becomes refractory within a few years. Acalabrutinib is a highly selective, potent, covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor with minimal off-target activity. WIthout head-to-head clinical trial data, estimation of the comparative efficacy and safety of new therapeutic entities provides valuable information for patients, clinicians, and health care payers. The objective of this analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib versus other targeted therapies employed for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL by using matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. METHODS: Individual data from 124 patients treated with acalabrutinib in the Phase II ACE-LY-004 trial were adjusted to match average baseline characteristics of populations from studies using alternative targeted treatment regimens for relapsed/refractory MCL (for monotherapy: ibrutinib, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and temsirolimus; for combination therapies: ibrutinib + rituximab, bendamustine + rituximab, and lenalidomide + rituximab). Patient populations were matched on age, sex, race, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Simplified MCL International Prognostic Index score, tumor bulk, lactate dehydrogenase concentration, extranodal disease, bone marrow involvement, and number of previous treatment regimens. Outcomes assessed included overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events. FINDINGS: After matching, acalabrutinib was associated with significant increases in ORR and CR rate (estimated treatment difference [95% CI]) versus ibrutinib (ORR, 9.3% [0.3-18.3]; CR, 14.9% [5.4-24.3]), bortezomib (ORR, 50.6% [40.2-61.0]; CR, 18.8% [9.1-28.5]), lenalidomide (ORR, 38.1% [27.1-49.1]; CR, 43.5% [34.8-52.3]), and temsirolimus (ORR, 40.7% [31.0-50.4]; CR, 27.1% [19.2-35.0]). PFS (hazard ratio [95% CI]) with acalabrutinib was significantly increased versus bortezomib (0.36 [0.26-0.51]), lenalidomide (0.65 [0.48-0.89]), lenalidomide + rituximab (0.57 [0.35-0.93]), and temsirolimus (0.33 [0.24-0.45]). Acalabrutinib was associated with significantly increased OS (hazard ratio) versus bortezomib (0.36 [0.22-0.61]) and temsirolimus (0.32 [0.23-0.44]). The overall safety profile of acalabrutinib was similar or better compared with the monotherapies; however, infection risk increased versus bendamustine + rituximab, and anemia increased risk versus lenalidomide + rituximab and ibrutinib + rituximab. IMPLICATIONS: This comparison of targeted therapies used in the treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL showed that acalabrutinib has the potential to provide increased response rates, with trends for increased PFS and OS, and an improved safety profile.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",31699438,

METHODS: We customized a Markov model with ten health states to estimate the lifetime economic and clinical outcomes in 6-week cycles. The efficacy (clinical event rates per 100 patient-years) and safety data were derived from a pairwise indirect treatment comparison. The analysis was conducted from both the national health service (NHS) and societal perspectives, and included pharmaceutical costs (retail price plus value-added tax (VAT) and applicable national deductions) according to daily dosages (apixaban 10 mg (5 mg twice daily (bid)) and edoxaban 60 or 30 mg) and complications and disease-management costs, obtained from national databases. Utilities for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) calculations reflected EuroQoL 5-Dimension scores in patients with AF. An annual discount rate of 3% was applied for costs (€, year 2019 values) and outcomes. RESULTS: In a 1000-patient cohort, apixaban 5 mg bid versus edoxaban 60 mg could avoid five strokes, six major bleedings and 29 clinically relevant non-major bleedings (CRNMBs). Compared with edoxaban 30 mg, apixaban could avoid 21 strokes and two SEs. An increase in bleedings was observed with apixaban (seven haemorrhagic strokes, 48 major bleedings and 17 CRNMBs). Apixaban yielded 0.04 additional QALYs compared with edoxaban 60 mg or 30 mg. Incremental costs/QALY were €9639.33 and €354.22 for apixaban versus edoxaban 60 mg and edoxaban 30 mg, respectively, from the NHS perspective and €7756.62 for apixaban versus edoxaban 60 mg from the societal perspective. Apixaban was dominant versus edoxaban 30 mg from the societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that apixaban 5 mg bid is a cost-effective alternative to edoxaban for stroke prevention in the AF population in Spain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",31673882,PMC7426339

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the budget impact of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination for adjuvant treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive resected Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC melanoma from a U.S. commercial payer perspective using data from the COMBI-AD trial, as well as other sources. METHODS: The budget impact of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination for patients with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive, resected Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC melanoma was evaluated from the perspective of a hypothetical population of 1 million members with demographic characteristics consistent with those of a commercially insured U.S. insurance plan (i.e., adults aged less than 65 years) using an economic model developed in Microsoft Excel. The model compared melanoma-related health care costs over a 3-year projection period under 2 scenarios: (1) a reference scenario in which dabrafenib and trametinib are assumed to be unavailable for adjuvant therapy and (2) a new scenario in which the combination is assumed to be available. Treatments potentially displaced by dabrafenib and trametinib were assumed to include observation, high-dose interferon alpha-2b, ipilimumab, and nivolumab. Costs considered in the model include those of adjuvant therapies and treatment of locoregional and distant recurrences. The numbers of patients eligible for treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib were based on data from cancer registries, published sources, and assumptions. Treatment mixes under the reference and new scenarios were based on market research data, clinical expert opinion, and assumptions. Probabilities of recurrence and death were based on data from the COMBI-AD trial and an indirect treatment comparison. Medication costs were based on wholesale acquisition cost prices. Costs of distant recurrence were from a health insurance claims study. RESULTS: In a hypothetical population of 1 million commercially insured members, 48 patients were estimated to become eligible for treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib in combination over the 3-year projection period; in the new scenario, 10 patients were projected to receive such treatment. Cumulative costs of melanoma-related care were estimated to be $6.3 million in the reference scenario and $6.9 million in the new scenario. The budget impact of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination was an increase of $549 thousand overall and 1.5 cents per member per month. CONCLUSIONS: For a hypothetical U.S. commercial health plan of 1 million members, the budget impact of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination as adjuvant treatment for melanoma is likely to be relatively modest and within the range of published estimates for oncology therapies. These results may assist payers in making coverage decisions regarding the use of adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib in melanoma.

Guselkumab has demonstrated additional benefit in patients with early inadequate response to ustekinumab. Long-term efficacy comparisons of guselkumab and ustekinumab are currently lacking among ustekinumab-naive patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative efficacy of guselkumab and ustekinumab for maintenance therapy of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, using individual patient data (IPD) from randomized controlled trials. METHODS: IPD for guselkumab from the VOYAGE 1 and 2 trials were pooled and compared with IPD for ustekinumab from the NAVIGATE trial. Multivariable logistic regression analyses compared guselkumab 100 mg and ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg for the achievement and maintenance of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90, 75 and 100 responses up to 40 weeks. The regression models accounted for a range of clinically relevant covariates (e.g. age, sex, psoriasis duration). Relative efficacy was expressed using odds ratios (ORs) and predicted probability of treatment response associated with each intervention. RESULTS: Patients receiving guselkumab had significantly higher probabilities of achieving a PASI 90 response than patients receiving ustekinumab, at both week 16 [70·4% vs. 46·0%, OR 2·79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2·22-3·45] and week 40 (74·2% vs. 54·5%, OR 2·40, 95% CI 1·89-3·13].

OBJECTIVES: Given the rapid effect of brexanolone injection (within 60 h) sustained throughout the length of the trials (30 days), we sought to compare its efficacy data against selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the class of antidepressants most commonly prescribed for PPD, using HAM-D and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) outcomes from currently available RCTs. METHODS: We extracted data from 26 studies identified in a systematic literature review of pharmacological and pharmacological/nonpharmacological combination therapies in PPD. Six studies were suitable to form evidence networks through which to perform indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) of HAM-D and EPDS outcomes between brexanolone and SSRIs. Having assessed the comparability and suitability of the available evidence for analysis, we discovered significant heterogeneity in the study designs, most notably in the placebo arms of the trials. We therefore conducted matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) between brexanolone and the placebo arms of comparator studies, subsequently using the MAIC results of brexanolone versus placebo, and results for SSRIs versus placebo, to form ITCs of brexanolone versus SSRIs at three separate time points-day 3, week 4 and last observation. ITCs were calculated as the differences in change from baseline (CFB) in HAM-D and, separately, CFB in EPDS, between treatments, and reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: For all time points, MAICs showed larger differences in CFB for brexanolone compared with SSRIs. Differences (95% CIs) between brexanolone and SSRIs were 12.79 (8.04-17.53) [day 3], 5.87 (- 1.62 to 13.37) [week 4] and 0.97 (- 6.35 to 8.30) [last observation] for the HAM-D. For the EPDS, the differences in CFB were 7.98 (5.32-10.64) [day 3], 6.35 (3.13-9.57) [week 4] and 4.05 (0.79-7.31) [last observation]. Other analytical approaches are also presented to demonstrate the similarity of results, using a network meta-analysis approach, and the importance of using the MAIC method to control for the important heterogeneity between placebo arms. CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledging the limitations of ITCs and this evidence base, when compared with SSRIs, these analyses suggest that brexanolone demonstrated larger differences in CFB for both patient- and clinician-reported PPD outcomes and at all investigated time points after adjusting for differences between placebos in the included studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",31642037,PMC6825025

We suspect that this issue may be partially attributable to limitations in current NMA software which do not readily produce all of the output needed to satisfy current guidelines. RESULTS: To better facilitate the conduct and reporting of NMAs, we have created an R package called ""BUGSnet"" (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling to conduct a Network meta-analysis). This R package relies upon Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) to conduct Bayesian NMA using a generalized linear model. BUGSnet contains a suite of functions that can be used to describe the evidence network, estimate a model and assess the model fit and convergence, assess the presence of heterogeneity and inconsistency, and output the results in a variety of formats including league tables and surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA) plots. We provide a demonstration of the functions contained within BUGSnet by recreating a Bayesian NMA found in the second technical support document composed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit (NICE-DSU). We have also mapped these functions to checklist items within current reporting and best practice guidelines. CONCLUSION: BUGSnet is a new R package that can be used to conduct a Bayesian NMA and produce all of the necessary output needed to satisfy current scientific and regulatory standards.

The analysis captured direct medical costs (expressed in 2017 Euros) from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS) and patient-related quality of life. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with gains of 0.09 life years and 0.13 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to iGlarLixi, due to a lower cumulative incidence and delayed onset of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was associated with an incremental cost of EUR 930 over patient lifetimes, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 7,386 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Over the lifetime of patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, IDegLira was associated with improved clinical outcomes at higher costs relative to iGlarLixi. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 30,000 per QALY gained, IDegLira was considered to be cost-effective versus iGlarLixi from the perspective of the Italian NHS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",31632108,PMC6789179

We conducted a direct and indirect comparison meta-analysis to evaluate the best choice in preventing post-ESD bleeding among proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine(2)-receptor antagonists (H(2)RAs), and the most widely used potassium-competitive acid blocker, vonoprazan. Methods: The Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched for randomized trials. We pooled odds ratios (OR) for preventing post-ESD bleeding using meta-analysis. Results: Sixteen randomized trials met the inclusion criteria including 2,062 patients. Direct comparisons showed slightly significant efficacy in PPIs rather than H(2)RAs in preventing post-ESD bleeding [OR: 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10 to 3.05] and vonoprazan was better than PPIs (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.86). The adjusted indirect comparison indicated vonoprazan was superior to H(2)RAs (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.74). In subgroup analysis, PPIs had similar efficacy as H(2)RAs in 4 weeks, while PPIs were better than H(2)RAs in 8 weeks' treatment (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.08 to 3.40). The superiority of vonoprazan than PPIs was more significant in combination therapy (OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.69). There was a significant difference in vonoprazan for 8 weeks of medication (OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.92). Conclusions: The effects of vonoprazan is better than PPIs than H(2)RAs in preventing bleeding after ESD. When vonoprazan combined with mucosal protective antiulcer drug in treatment or used in 8 weeks of medication, the efficacy may be even better.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",31607912,PMC6761621

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness (CE) of empagliflozin + SoC in comparison to sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC based on the respective CVOT. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes Model (CDM) was calibrated to reproduce the CVOT outcomes. EMPA-REG OUTCOME baseline characteristics and CVOT specific treatment effects on risk factors for cardiovascular disease [glycated haemogloblin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipids] were applied. Three-year observed cardiovascular events of empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC were derived from EMPA-REG OUTCOME and an indirect treatment comparison. Relative risk (RR) adjustments to calibrate the CDM were estimated after consecutive attempts of running the model until the observed and CDM-predicted outcomes matched closely. The drug-specific treatment effects were considered up until treatment switch (when HbA1c reached 8.5%), after which, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) 82 risk equations predicted events based on co-existing risk factors and treatment intensification to basal-bolus insulin were applied. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Costs and quality of life data were derived from UK national sources and published literature. A 50-year time horizon and discount rate of 3.5% were applied. RESULTS: The CDM projected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 6.408, 5.917 and 5.704 and total costs of 50,801 GBP, 47,627 GBP and 48,071 GBP for empagliflozin + SoC, sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC, respectively. The incremental CE ratio (ICER) of empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC was 6464 GBP/QALY and 3878 GBP/QALY, respectively. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that empagliflozin + SoC is cost-effective compared to sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC at a willingness to pay threshold of 20,000 GBP/QALY.

In this study, a literature-based analysis was undertaken to assess, via an indirect treatment comparison, the comparative efficacy of BV to salvage chemotherapy as treatment for R/R cHL patients following ASCT. This comparative effectiveness research was undertaken to support a reimbursement submission for BV to the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. Retrospective analysis of individual patient data from four data sources demonstrated that the use of BV as first salvage treatment in cHL patients relapsing or progressing post-ASCT achieved improvements in both clinical response and overall survival. More specifically, BV was associated with an incremental improvement of 22% in overall response rate compared to salvage chemotherapy. Five-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 92·2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 85·5-99·3%] and 32·2% (95% CI: 19·1-54·6%) respectively for BV, compared to 30·5% (95% CI: 22·2-42·0%) and 3·2% (95% CI: 1·1-8·9%) respectively for salvage chemotherapy. The encouraging results from this conservative analysis have the potential to support informed clinical management and funding decisions for the first salvage of cHL patients demonstrating recurrence after ASCT.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",31588564,PMC7028067

No head-to-head trial data were available to compare the efficacy of nivolumab to that of observation, so indirect treatment comparisons were required. Additionally, overall survival (OS) data were not available from CheckMate-238, and the clinical pathway for melanoma has changed significantly over the last decade. Four modelling options were developed using different methods and evidence sources to estimate OS and the impact of nivolumab on predicted life-years in the adjuvant setting; however, this article focuses on two primary methods. METHODS: RFS for nivolumab and observation were informed by a patient-level data meta-regression. The first model was a partitioned survival model, where the parametric OS curve for observation was derived from CA184-029 and nivolumab OS was based on a surrogacy relationship between RFS and OS specific to adjuvant melanoma. The other option used a state-transition model to estimate post-recurrence survival using different data sources. RESULTS: The modelling options estimated different OS for both nivolumab and observation but demonstrated at least a 32% increase in life-years gained for nivolumab versus observation. CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrated the difficulties in modelling within the adjuvant setting. Each model produced different survival projections, showing the need to explore different techniques to address the extent of uncertainty. This also highlighted the importance of understanding the impact of RFS in the long term in a setting where the aim of treatment is to remain disease free.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",31587138,PMC7248152

In 2018, the FDA approved combination glasdegib (GLAS) plus LDAC based on Phase II results demonstrating improved overall survival (OS) versus LDAC alone in previously untreated AML. However, no randomized clinical trials have directly compared GLAS + LDAC with other AML treatments. OBJECTIVE: Using both indirect treatment comparison (ITC) and simulated treatment comparison (STC), which adjusts for baseline differences between trials, the comparative effectiveness of GLAS + LDAC was compared with hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA) or decitabine (DEC). METHODS: A systematic literature review identified published trials of AZA or DEC versus LDAC among older AML patients ineligible for high-intensity chemotherapy. In addition to standard and covariate-adjusted ITC, STC was performed following guidance from the NICE Decision Support Unit (DSU). Using individual patient data from the Phase II GLAS + LDAC study, population-specific OS hazard ratios (HR) for GLAS + LDAC versus AZA or DEC were compared. Furthermore, covariate-adjusted ITC (Cox multivariate models) and STC were repeated using GLAS + LDAC versus LDAC data propensity-weighted for within-trial mean cytogenetic risk. As this initial step was not specified in the DSU, results from this second method were compared to the first STC following DSU guidance only. RESULTS: Standard ITC and STC both demonstrated significantly improved OS for GLAS + LDAC versus either AZA or DEC. Adjusting for key covariates, STC stepwise exponential models demonstrated GLAS + LDAC superiority to both AZA (HR=0.424; 95% CI: 0.228, 0.789) and DEC (HR=0.505; 95% CI: 0.269, 0.949). These significant results held using full or step-wise approaches, following DSU guidance only or the weighted STC approach. CONCLUSION: Using ITC and STC, GLAS + LDAC demonstrated superior OS to AZA or DEC in an adult population with previously untreated AML for whom intensive chemotherapy is not an option.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Potential exampl about how for the same sudy they may use aggregated data and IPD for the same comparison""]}",31564931,PMC6735653

Events may happen any time during that interval but can only be detected during a planned or unplanned visit. Disease progression in oncology is a notable example where the time to an event is affected by the schedule of visits within a study. This can become a source of bias when studies with varying assessment schedules are used in unanchored comparisons using methods such as matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. OBJECTIVE: We illustrate assessment-time bias (ATB) in a simulation study based on data from a recent study in second-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, and present a method to adjust for differences in assessment schedule when comparing progression-free survival (PFS) against a competing treatment. METHODS: A multi-state model for death and progression was used to generate simulated death and progression times, from which PFS times were derived. PFS data were also generated for a hypothetical comparator treatment by applying a constant hazard ratio (HR) to the baseline treatment. Simulated PFS times for the two treatments were then aligned to different assessment schedules so that progression events were only observed at set visit times, and the data were analysed to assess the bias and standard error of estimates of HRs between two treatments with and without assessment-schedule matching (ASM). RESULTS: ATB is highly affected by the rate of the event at the first assessment time; in our examples, the bias ranged from 3 to 11% as the event rate increased. The proposed method relies on individual-level data from a study and attempts to adjust the timing of progression events to the comparator's schedule by shifting them forward or backward without altering the patients' actual follow-up time. The method removed the bias almost completely in all scenarios without affecting the precision of estimates of comparative effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the increasing use of unanchored comparative analyses for novel cancer treatments based on single-arm studies, the proposed method offers a relatively simple means of improving the accuracy of relative benefits of treatments on progression times.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",31555968,

Methods: A SLR was conducted to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating approved adjuvant treatments including interferon-containing regimens, BRAF-inhibitors, and PD-L1 inhibitors in stage III melanoma patients. Relative treatment effects for recurrence-free survival (RFS) were synthesized with Bayesian NMA models that allowed for hazard ratios (HRs) to vary over time. Results: Included studies formed a connected network of evidence composed of eight trials. In high-risk stage III patients, the HR for pembrolizumab vs observation decreased significantly over time with the superiority of pembrolizumab over observation becoming statistically meaningful before 3 months. By 9 months, the HR for pembrolizumab vs observation was statistically significantly lower than the HR for most other treatments vs observation, with the exception of ipilimumab and biochemotherapy due to overlapping 95% credible intervals. In BRAF + patients, pembrolizumab was statistically significantly better than observation after 3 months. The HR for both BRAF-inhibitors vs observation increased significantly over time and pembrolizumab was statistically superior to both BRAF-inhibitors after 15 months. Conclusions: Pembrolizumab results in statistically significantly improved RFS compared to all competing regimens after 9 months, except ipilimumab and biochemotherapy, for the adjuvant treatment of stage III melanoma. However, point estimate HRs vs observation for pembrolizumab are much lower than those for ipilimumab. In BRAF + patients, the advantage of pembrolizumab versus competing interventions increases over time with respect to RFS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",31489255,PMC6713115

A pivotal trial compared nivolumab with ipilimumab; however, no head-to-head trial exists comparing nivolumab to observation, a common comparator in the adjuvant setting. Here, we compared the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of nivolumab with observation or ipilimumab as adjuvant therapies in resected stage IIIB/C melanoma. METHODS: Patient data were pooled from the EORTC 18071 and CheckMate 238 trials using propensity score weighting and adjusting for cross-trial differences. Number needed to treat (NNT) and costs per recurrence-free life-month (RFLM) at 12, 16, 18, and 24 months (as data allowed) were estimated. Costs included drug acquisition, administration costs, and direct medical costs. Sensitivity analyses including patients with stage IIIB/C and resected stage IV melanoma were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 1287 patients (278 nivolumab, 365 observation, and 644 ipilimumab) with resected stage IIIB/C melanoma were pooled. NNTs to achieve one additional recurrence-free survivor with nivolumab versus observation were 3.93 at 12 months and 3.42 at 24 months; NNTs for nivolumab versus ipilimumab were 7.97 at 12 months and 6.43 at 24 months. Mean drug costs per RFLM were lower for nivolumab at 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively (nivolumab: $13,447, $9462, and $7370; ipilimumab: $52,734, $40,484, and $33,875).

The sensitivity analysis results were consistent with the base case. CONCLUSION: For resected melanoma, adjuvant nivolumab is both clinically effective and cost-effective compared with observation or ipilimumab. Adjuvant nivolumab was associated with a lower drug cost per RFLM compared with ipilimumab, and a lower medical cost compared with observation. Future analyses incorporating long-term follow-up data may help increase understanding of the economic impact of nivolumab in the adjuvant setting.

METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Randomized controlled trials comparing acupuncture or propranolol with sham acupuncture, placebo, waiting-list control or usual care were included. We extracted information from the included trials using a standardized extraction form. The primary outcome was migraine episodes. The secondary outcomes included migraine days, migraine frequency, and adverse events. RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs (n = 3656) after screening 1078 articles. The analysis showed that acupuncture had a significant advantage over propranolol in reducing migraine episodes over a 4-week period (SMD - 0.74, 95% CI - 1.04 to - 0.44).

In rare diseases such as hemophilia, where small populations preclude head-to-head comparisons in randomized controlled trials, outcomes from different studies can be compared by matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (MAICs) via matched summary statistics of individual patient data. This study compared MAIC-adjusted outcomes of BAY 94-9027 with other FVIII agents for prophylaxis of hemophilia. Methods: Weighted patient data from the BAY 94-9027 PROTECT VIII trial were used to compare annualized bleeding rates (ABRs), percentage of patients with zero bleeds, and factor utilization against published data on rFVIII-Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc), BAX 855, and recombinant antihemophilic factor/plasma/albumin-free method (rAHF-PFM). Results: After matching BAY 94-9027 and comparators, the mean BAY 94-9027 utilization was significantly lower than rFVIIIFc pre- and post-matching (66.2 vs 82.2 IU/kg/week; 66.5 vs 82.2 IU/kg/week; both P<0.001).

Cisplatin-ineligible patients experience a high frequency of adverse events from the most commonly used standard of care treatment, carboplatin plus gemcitabine, or alternative treatment with gemcitabine monotherapy. Pembrolizumab is a potent, highly selective humanised monoclonal antibody that releases checkpoint inhibition of the immune response system, and provides a new alternative for these patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of urothelial carcinoma ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy in patients with strongly PD-L1-positive tumours in Sweden. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Parametric survival curves were fitted to overall survival, progression-free survival, and time on treatment data from KEYNOTE-052 to extrapolate clinical outcomes. A simulated treatment comparison and a network meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of pembrolizumab versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine monotherapy. EQ-5D data from KEYNOTE-052 were used to estimate utility, while resource use and cost inputs were estimated using Swedish regional pricing lists and clinician opinion. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The model reported costs, life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and results were tested using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We estimated that pembrolizumab would improve survival by 2.11 and 2.16 years and increase QALYs by 1.71 and 1.75 compared to carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine monotherapy, respectively. Pembrolizumab was associated with a cost increase of €90520 versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and €95055 versus gemcitabine, with corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of €53055/QALY and €54415/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €100000/QALY, pembrolizumab is a cost-effective treatment versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and versus gemcitabine. PATIENT SUMMARY: This is the first analysis to show that pembrolizumab is a cost-effective option for first-line treatment of cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in Sweden.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",31412011,

Following the availability of two new drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone, a number of network meta-analyses (NMAs) of randomised controlled trials have been published which have conducted indirect comparisons on the two drugs. Differing recommendations from these studies are potentially confusing to clinicians and decision-makers. We aimed to systematically review published NMAs of IPF treatments, to compare their findings and summarise key recommendations. Materials and Methods: We systematically reviewed (PROSPERO: CRD42017072876) six eligible NMAs and investigated the differences in their findings with respect to key endpoints. We focused on differences in head-to-head comparisons between nintedanib and pirfenidone. Results: The NMAs were broadly consistent, with most differences being explained by model choice, endpoint definitions, inclusion of different studies, different follow-up durations, and access to unpublished data. A substantive difference remained, however, in the change from baseline forced vital capacity (FVC). One NMA favoured nintedanib, another found no statistical difference, whilst others did not conduct the analysis. These differences can be attributed to the choice of methodology, the use of the standardised mean difference (SMD) scale, and population heterogeneity. Conclusions: NMA methods facilitated the comparison of nintedanib and pirfenidone in the absence of a head-to-head trial. However, further work is needed to determine whether the trial populations are homogeneous and whether the SMD is appropriate in this population. Differences in patient characteristics may obscure the difference in treatment effects. To assist decision-makers, an exploration of efficacy in real-world populations may be prudent.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,no_paitc",31390809,PMC6723644

However, the situation often arises where a researcher has IPD for trials concerning a particular treatment (eg, from a sponsor) but none for other trials. Therefore, one can reweight the IPD so that the covariate characteristics in the IPD trials match that of the aggregate data (AgD) trials, using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). We assess the impact of using the reweighted aggregated data, obtained by the MAIC, in a Bayesian NMA for a connected treatment network. We apply this method to a network of multiple myeloma treatments in newly diagnosed patients (ndMM), where the outcome is progression free survival. We investigate the reliability of the methods and results through a simulation study. The ndMM network consists of three IPD studies comparing lenalidomide to placebo (Len-Placebo), one AgD study comparing Len-Placebo, and one AgD study comparing thalidomide to placebo (Thal-Placebo). We therefore investigate two options of weighting the covariates: (a) All three studies are weighted separately to match the AgD Thal-Placebo trial. (b) Patients are weighted across all three IPD studies to match the AgD Thal-Placebo trial, but the NMA considers each trial separately. We observe limited benefit to MAIC in the full network population. While MAIC can be beneficial as a sensitivity analysis to confirm results across patient populations, we advise that MAIC is used and interpreted with caution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",31368653,

This MAIC assessed the comparative effectiveness of secukinumab (an anti-interleukin-17A) and etanercept (a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor) in a target population of biologic-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: Individual patient data pooled from FUTURE 2 (NCT01752634), FUTURE 3 (NCT01989468), and FUTURE 5 (NCT02404350) (secukinumab: 150 mg, n=458 and 300 mg, n=461) were matched to data from the population in the NCT00317499 trial (etanercept 25 mg, n=101) using MAIC methodology, by adjusting for clinical and demographic baseline characteristics. Recalculated outcomes from FUTURE 2, 3, and 5 (150 mg, effective sample size (ESS) post-matching=104; 300 mg, ESS=75; and placebo, ESS=159) were compared with the NCT00317499 trial. Pairwise comparisons using odds ratios (ORs) were performed for the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, 50, and 70 response criteria at week 12 (placebo-adjusted) and week 24 (non-placebo-adjusted). RESULTS: At week 12, there were no significant differences in ACR responses between secukinumab and etanercept. There was no significant difference between secukinumab 150 mg and etanercept at week 24 with respect to ACR 20 and 50 response rates; however, ACR 70 response rates were higher for secukinumab 150 mg (OR (95% confidence interval (CI)): 4.48 (2.01-9.99), p<0.001). ACR 20, 50, and 70 response rates were higher with secukinumab 300 mg than with etanercept at this time point (OR (95% CI): ACR 20, 3.28 (1.69-6.38), p<0.001; ACR 50, 1.90 (1.04-3.50), p=0.038; and ACR 70, 3.56 (1.51-8.40), p=0.004).

METHODS: A comprehensive search of online databases was performed. A traditional meta-analysis was performed to determine the risk ratio of BVM vs. LMA and ETI vs. LMA. Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) were conducted to compare BVM and ETI. RESULTS: A total of 13 full-text articles reporting the efficacy of BVM, ETI, and LMA were considered in this analysis. BVM and LMA had the same effect regarding return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (23% vs. 24%; RR =0.84), survival rate at admission (19% vs. 21%; RR =0.82) or discharge (6% vs. 4%; RR =0.61). ETI was superior to LMA in terms of ROSC (48% vs. 23%; RR =0.72) and survival rate at both admission (27% vs. 19%; RR =0.85) and discharge (12% vs. 4%; RR =0.90).

We conducted a systematic review and assessed the feasibility of an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) to characterize the comparative efficacy of endocrine-based therapies in this setting. A systematic literature review (SLR) of Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and key conferences was performed to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) satisfying the following criteria: (a) included pre/perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC, (b) included endocrine-based therapies, (c) reported efficacy, safety, or quality of life outcomes, and (d) was published in 2007 or later (when HER2 testing was standardized). The clinical and methodological similarities across trials were assessed to evaluate the feasibility of an ITC. Four RCTs (PALOMA-3, MONARCH-2, KCSG BR10-04 and MONALEESA-7) and eight regimens (palbociclib + fulvestrant + goserelin, fulvestrant + goserelin, abemaciclib + fulvestrant + gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist [GnRHa], fulvestrant + GnRHa, anastrozole + goserelin, goserelin, ribociclib + NSAI/tamoxifen + goserelin and NSAI/tamoxifen + goserelin) were selected. MONALEESA-7 was the only phase 3 trial investigating endocrine-based therapies as first-line in only pre/perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC; the other three trials focused on the ET-failure setting and their pre/perimenopausal populations were relatively small. ITCs were methodologically unfeasible due to critical differences in treatment settings and lack of common comparators across trials. Therefore, we were not able to characterize the relative efficacy of the different endocrine-based therapies available in the premenopausal HR+/HER2- mBC setting. This systematic review provides a comprehensive assessment of the available trial evidence on the efficacy and safety of endocrine-based therapies for premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC. Only four trials have reported relevant data in this setting, and MONALEESA-7 is currently the only trial focused on premenopausal HR+ HER2- mBC in the first-line setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,feasibility",31290203,

VBNC pathogens can potentially present a serious risk to human health as they are invisible to routine microbiological culture-based methods. Of high importance is the increased tolerance to antibiotics or disinfectant measures while in the VBNC state. The greatest remaining challenge for such investigations is the lack of an appropriate, cost-effective multi-species screening method due to experimental constraints. In this study, we investigated if de novo ATP production of cells in the VBNC state is a suitable indicator for overall cell viability that can be utilized to determine the minimum ATP inhibitory concentration (MAIC) of antibiotics and other antimicrobials. To validate this approach, heat-stress time-kill experiments were performed with both culturable and VBNC cells. We developed a comprehensive experimental setup and demonstrated the applicability of this VBNC-MIC assay for testing the tolerance of 12 strains of 4 important bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes) in the VBNC state to eight important antimicrobials including four different antibiotics. We confirmed that bacteria in the VBNC state were resistant to all tested antibiotics (ampicillin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin) and additionally insensitive to disinfectants (benzalkonium chloride and trioctylmethylammonium chloride) and preservatives (bronopol and sodium azide). These data emphasize the need for further research regarding the characteristics of bacterial pathogens in the VBNC state and present the advantages and high-throughput capabilities of ATP determinations to investigate tolerance of VBNC pathogens to antimicrobials. The presented method should be helpful in order to identify appropriate countermeasures, treatments, or disinfectants when confronted with bacterial pathogens in the VBNC state.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",31258524,PMC6587809

The cost effectiveness of blinatumomab versus inotuzumab has not previously been examined. METHODS: Cost effectiveness of blinatumomab versus inotuzumab in R/R B-cell precursor ALL patients with one or no prior salvage therapy from a United States (US) payer perspective was estimated using a partitioned survival model. Health outcomes were estimated based on published aggregate data from INO-VATE-ALL and individual patient data from TOWER weighted to match patients in INO-VATE-ALL using matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). Analyses were conducted using five approaches relating to use of anchored versus unanchored comparisons of health outcomes and, for the anchored comparisons, the reference treatment to which treatment effects on health outcomes were applied. Estimates from TOWER including the probabilities of complete remission and allogeneic stem-cell transplant (allo-SCT), overall and event-free survival, utilities, duration of therapy, and use of subsequent therapies were MAIC adjusted to match INO-VATE-ALL. Costs of treatment, adverse events, allo-SCT, subsequent therapies, and terminal care were from published sources. A 50-year time horizon and 3% annual discount rate were used. RESULTS: Incremental costs for blinatumomab versus inotuzumab ranged from US$7023 to US$36,244, depending on the approach used for estimating relative effectiveness. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) ranged from 0.54 to 1.78. Cost effectiveness for blinatumomab versus inotuzumab ranged from US$4006 to US$20,737 per QALY gained.

It is not known how this strategy compares with initial treatment with a biological. We therefore compared the effectiveness of tocilizumab (TCZ), or TCZ plus MTX (TCZ+MTX) with MTX plus 10 mg prednisone (MTX+pred), all initiated within a treat-to-target treatment strategy in early RA. METHODS: Using individual patient data of two trials, we indirectly compared tight-controlled treat-to-target strategies initiating TCZ (n=103), TCZ+MTX (n=106) or MTX+pred (n=117), using initiation of MTX (n=227) as reference. Primary outcome was Disease Activity Score assessing 28 joints (DAS28) over 24 months. To assess the influence of acute phase reactants (APRs), a disease activity composite outcome score without APR (ie, modification of the Clinical Disease Activity Index (m-CDAI)) was analysed. Secondary outcomes were remission (several definitions), physical function and radiographic progression. Multilevel models were used to account for clustering within trials and patients over time, correcting for relevant confounders. RESULTS: DAS28 over 24 months was lower for TCZ+MTX than for MTX+Pred (mean difference: -0.62 (95% CI -1.14 to -0.10)). Remission was more often achieved in TCZ+MTX and in TCZ versus MTX+pred (p=0.02/0.05, respectively). Excluding APRs from the disease activity outcome score, TCZ-based strategies showed a slightly higher m-CDAI compared with MTX+pred, but this was not statistically significant. Other outcomes were also not statistically significantly different between the strategies. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early RA, although TCZ-based strategies resulted in better DAS28 and remission rates compared with MTX+pred, at least part of these effects may be due to a specific effect of TCZ on APRs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",31196844,

However, common comparators may not be available, or the comparison may be biased due to differences in effect modifiers between the included studies. Recently proposed population adjustment methods aim to adjust for differences between study populations in the situation where individual patient data are available from at least one study, but not all studies. They can also be used when there is no common comparator or for single-arm studies (unanchored comparisons). We aim to characterise the use of population adjustment methods in technology appraisals (TAs) submitted to the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). METHODS: We reviewed NICE TAs published between 01/01/2010 and 20/04/2018. RESULTS: Population adjustment methods were used in 7 percent (18/268) of TAs. Most applications used unanchored comparisons (89 percent, 16/18), and were in oncology (83 percent, 15/18). Methods used included matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (89 percent, 16/18) and simulated treatment comparisons (17 percent, 3/18). Covariates were included based on: availability, expert opinion, effective sample size, statistical significance, or cross-validation. Larger treatment networks were commonplace (56 percent, 10/18), but current methods cannot account for this. Appraisal committees received results of population-adjusted analyses with caution and typically looked for greater cost effectiveness to minimise decision risk.

The objective of this study was to develop a Markov model with a lifetime time horizon to assess the cost effectiveness of ponatinib for third-line chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) or alloHSCT from the public healthcare system perspective in Germany, Sweden, and Canada. METHODS: Clinical outcomes were derived from the literature, and from patient-level data (phase II PACE trial) for ponatinib. Resource use included drugs, alloHSCT, monitoring and follow-up, adverse events, and end-of-life care; costs were based on national tariffs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using chronic myeloid leukemia health-state utilities from an international time-trade-off study. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum for Germany and Sweden, and 5% for Canada. RESULTS: Ponatinib yielded more discounted QALYs than any second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor/alloHSCT in all three countries, mainly owing to better response rates and longer durations of response. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors were US$21,543-37,755/QALY in Germany, $24,018-38,227/QALY in Sweden, and $43,001-58,515/QALY in Canada. Ponatinib was dominant over alloHSCT in Germany, while incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. alloHSCT in Sweden and Canada were $715/QALY and $31,534/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib may improve outcomes (mainly because of higher response rates and longer response durations) at an acceptable cost level compared with other third-line treatment options for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia in Germany, Sweden, and Canada; however, the lack of an indirect comparison is a limitation of our study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",31168745,

However, switchability between generics is unknown, as direct comparisons between generics are not performed. The aim of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence between generic clopidogrel products by means of adjusted indirect comparisons (AICs). METHODS: AICs were conducted to assess bioequivalence between 4 generic clopidogrel products that are authorised in Serbia. Generics are considered equivalent to the reference if the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios test/reference of the maximum concentration (C(max) ) and area under the curve up to the last measurable concentration (AUC(0-t) ) fall within the acceptance range 80.00-125.00%. However, for AICs between generics, the Canadian acceptance criterion for C(max) was employed, where only the point estimate of C(max) needs to be within 80.00-125.00%. RESULTS: The 90% CIs of the AICs demonstrated bioequivalence within 80.00-125.00% for all AUC(0-t) comparisons. The point estimates of C(max) in all AICs were also within this range. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the bioavailability of these 4 generic clopidogrel products authorised in Serbia is very similar. Despite the limited power of AICs, bioequivalence was demonstrated for all 90% CIs of AUC(0-t) and all 90% CIs of C(max) comparisons were within or very close to the acceptance range, being able to comply with the acceptance criterion employed in Canada for C(max) . Therefore, these 4 generic clopidogrel products authorised in Serbia can be considered switchable with each other in clinical practice based on the adjusted indirect comparisons.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",31140620,PMC6710521

Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs), namely network meta-analysis (NMA), anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), and simulated treatment comparison (STC), were conducted to compare the relative efficacy of these therapies. METHODS: Patient-level data from a study that evaluated InO with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy (INO-VATE-ALL) and published data from a study that evaluated Blina with SoC chemotherapy (TOWER) were used in the analyses. Endpoints evaluated included remission rate defined as complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), overall survival (OS), and event-free survival (EFS). For each outcome, treatment-effect modifiers were adjusted for in the anchored MAIC and STC analyses. RESULTS: Analyses showed statistically significant higher rates of remission and HSCT with InO compared to Blina irrespective of the ITC method used or measure of the effect (i.e., odds ratio [OR] or rate difference). The treatment effects derived from the MAIC and STC analyses were consistent and stronger than those estimated from the NMA. A trend favoring InO was detected for EFS. The ITC results for OS suggest no difference between InO and Blina. CONCLUSION: Results from these ITCs indicated a statistically significant advantage for InO over Blina for rates of remission and HSCT in adults with relapsed or refractory B cell precursor ALL. It was not possible to fully adjust for all treatment-effect modifiers, and the similarity in chemotherapy regimens used in the SoC comparator arms of the INO-VATE-ALL and TOWER studies is worthy of further exploration. Both studies, however, used chemotherapy regimens that have a low response rate; therefore, no significant differences in efficacy outcomes are expected between SoC arms.

Recently, randomized controlled trials have examined the benefit of apalutamide and enzalutamide in these patients. We sought to perform an indirect treatment comparison using a network meta-analysis approach to compare the relative efficacy and toxicity of these two agents. The primary outcome of this analysis was metastasis-free survival (MFS) while secondary outcomes were time to prostate-specific antigen progression, overall survival, and adverse events. The Bucher technique for indirect comparison was used to compare apalutamide and enzalutamide using the common placebo comparator. We found no evidence of a significant difference in MFS (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.37) between enzalutamide and apalutamide. Similarly, there were no differences for any of the secondary outcomes. While indirect comparisons cannot supplant direct comparative data, this analysis suggests that apalutamide and enzalutamide are similarly effective in delaying metastases for patients with nmCRPC. PATIENT SUMMARY: Historically, there have been few treatment options for prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy who have rising prostate-specific antigen levels without obvious recurrence of cancer. Recent randomized controlled trials demonstrated that treatment with enzalutamide and apalutamide delayed the development of metastatic cancer. This study demonstrates through an indirect comparison that both medications are likely to have similar efficacy and side-effect profiles.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",31102627,

The prognosis of ovarian cancer is poor because it is prone to early metastasis during progression. Therefore, early diagnosis of ovarian cancer is very important. Some systematic reviews have evaluated the diagnostic value of different biomarkers for ovarian cancer. However, there is no consensus in the conclusions, and some are even contradictory. This study aims to assess the methodological and reporting quality of available systematic reviews and to find an optimal biomarker for diagnosing ovarian cancer. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase.com, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science were searched to identify relevant systematic reviews from inception to February 2019. We included systematic reviews that include randomized controlled trials, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, or cohort studies as long as the systematic reviews evaluated the diagnostic performance of biomarkers for ovarian cancer. The methodological quality will be assessed using assessment of multiple systematic reviews-2 checklist, and the reporting quality will be assessed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis diagnostic test accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) checklist. The pairwise meta-analysis and indirect comparisons will be performed using STATA (13.0; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).

In standard NMA, all existing (single or combined) treatments are different nodes in the network. However, sometimes an alternative model is of interest that utilizes the information that some treatments are combinations of common components, called component network meta-analysis (CNMA) model. The additive CNMA model assumes that the effect of a treatment combined of two components A and B is the sum of the effects of A and B, which is easily extended to treatments composed of more than two components. This implies that in comparisons equal components cancel out. Interaction CNMA models also allow interactions between the components. Bayesian analyses have been suggested. We report an implementation of CNMA models in the frequentist R package netmeta. All parameters are estimated using weighted least squares regression. We illustrate the application of CNMA models using an NMA of treatments for depression in primary care.

METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Two independent reviewers screened for study eligibility and extracted data. Random controlled trials, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, and cohort studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of hormonal markers for endometriosis were included. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: We included 17 studies that involved 1279 participants and evaluated 7 hormonal biomarkers. The pooled sensitivity and specificity in endometriosis were .79 (.71, .86) and .89 (.82, .94) for aromatase, .30 (.18, .46) and .80 (.65, .90) for human chorionic gonadotropin/luteinizing hormone receptor, .75 (.66, .83) and .47 (.34, .60) for estrogen receptor (ER)-α, .65 (.56, .74) and .68 (.55, .80) for ER-β, .45 (.38-.52) and .92 (.85-.97) for serum prolactin, .69 (.51, .83) and .30 (.16, .49) for estrogen sulfotransferase, and .73 (.60-.84) and .48 (.33-.63) for 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (17βHSD2). Compared with human chorionic gonadotropin/luteinizing hormone receptor, ER-α, ER-β, estrogen sulfotransferase, and 17βHSD2, aromatase had a higher sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio. The specificities of aromatase and serum prolactin were comparable, but the sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio, and positive likelihood ratio of serum prolactin were much lower than that of aromatase.

These trials included heterogeneous patient populations in terms of disease and baseline characteristics. These hamper the use of standard network meta-analyses for indirect treatment comparison of relative efficacy. In this situation, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) in second-line CP-CML was performed. The aim was to compare the relative efficacies of bosutinib, dasatinib and nilotinib in second-line CP-CML patients.Methods: The MAIC was preceded by a systematic literature review that ensured inclusion of the underlying data for the analyses. The outcomes were measured in terms of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR). The treatments were quantitatively compared based on Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) regressions, on restricted mean survival (RMST, when the proportionality assumption showed evidence of violation) and on odds ratios (for response measures).Results: Comparing with dasatinib, bosutinib resulted in HRs for PFS and OS of 0.63 (0.44-0.90, p < .05) and 0.82 (0.54-1.26, p = .37) respectively, and resulted in an OR for MCyR of 0.78 (0.53-1.16). Although the proportionality of hazards assumption was violated for PFS, the RMST analyses confirmed the findings of the Cox regression. When compared with nilotinib, bosutinib showed a significant HR of 0.54 (0.38-0.76, p < .01) in favor of bosutinib for PFS, a non-significant HR of 0.72 (0.46-1.13, p = .16) for OS and a non-significant OR of 0.98 (0.71-1.35) for MCyR.Conclusions: Bosutinib had a significantly greater PFS than both dasatinib and nilotinib. For OS, the findings were numerically in favor of bosutinib, but not statistically significant. For MCyR, the findings were numerically in favor of dasatinib and nilotinib, but not statistically significant.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",30964361,

Pramipexole-ER may be less likely to induce somnolence as an AE compared with ropinirole-SR (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23, 0.89). However, there were no statistically significant differences in UPDRS-motor score reduction, incidence of dyskinesia, hallucination, hypotension, insomnia and nausea, or withdrawals due to AE, for any reason. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive therapy with ropinirole-SR or pramipexole appears to offer similar efficacy and tolerability in patients with advanced PD on the basis of this indirect comparison.

rayyan-804154605,,2019,4,,,,,,,"",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35157413/,eng,,London,"The type of care a preterm baby receives within the first few hours of life can have a significant impact on their long-term outcome. The phrase “golden hour,” first used in trauma patients, has been adopted to refer to neonatal care at this crucial time. Early delivery room respiratory support in preterm infants has been extensively investigated and may make a significant contribution to reducing the risk of long-term lung damage, other morbidities and even death. One of the difficult choices in the current era is to determine whether or not to intubate a preterm baby in order to give surfactant very soon after birth. Many babies can be supported by non-invasive methods of delivering oxygen, such as continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), which avoid intubation. There is evidence that surfactant can be administered to these non-intubated babies using less invasive administration techniques that may reduce the risk of morbidity associated with intubation. At present it is not clear which is the best strategy. This review aims to explore which delivery room respiratory support techniques are likely to give optimal disease-free survival in preterm infants. We have compared early invasive intubation and surfactant administration techniques, with less invasive surfactant administration techniques and non-invasive respiratory support techniques. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm babies is caused by a deficiency of lung surfactant. The risk of RDS increases with decreasing gestational age, and is almost inevitable in babies born at less than 28 weeks gestation. Without surfactant the lungs become stiff and the alveoli collapse at end-expiration, and untreated RDS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Surfactant is a naturally produced surface-active lipoprotein complex mixed with proteins, which reduces the surface tension at the alveolar liquid surface. Surfactant allows alveoli to stay open in expiration and substantially reduces the work of breathing. It also reduces shearing forces on immature alveolar membrane, preventing membrane rupture and protein leak into the alveolar space with resulting lung damage. RDS in preterm babies can be prevented by administration of exogenous animal derived surfactant therapy, and this substantially reduces mortality and respiratory morbidity for this population, including improved survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days. However, the optimal dose (including the use of single or multiple administration) and mode of administration of surfactant remains controversial and may make a significant contribution to the chances of long term lung damage, other morbidities or death. The various techniques of administration can be grouped into three categories: conventional endotracheal intubation (where the baby is intubated, surfactant is administered and the baby then continues on mechanical ventilation); endotracheal intubation and surfactant administration followed by immediate extubation (also called Intubate, Surfactant, Rapid Extubation, and known as InSuRE or ISX); surfactant administration without endotracheal intubation via a thin endotracheal catheter during spontaneous breathing or with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) (known as Minimally Invasive Surfactant Therapy, MIST or Less Invasive Surfactant Administration, LISA, or Avoidance of Mechanical Ventilation, AMV). This review aims to explore which administration technique and dosing regimen is likely to give optimal outcomes in preterm infants. Low flow oxygen is frequently used in neonatal units, as an integral part of respiratory support in preterm babies. The goal of oxygen therapy is to achieve adequate delivery of oxygen to the tissues without causing oxygen toxicity. In addition to delivering oxygen via a ventilator or CPAP circuit, there are several different methods of low-flow oxygen administration: head box oxygen, incubator, facemask, nasal prongs, nasal cannula and nasopharyngeal catheter. Oxygen can be delivered humidified or non-humidified, and the method of titration can be automated or manual. It is important to know, the efficacy, potential risks, and the impact on lung function of the different methods when used in preterm babies. The aim of this review is to determine the optimal type of oxygen delivered, method of administration and method of titration in preterm babies requiring respiratory support. The lungs of preterm babies are structurally immature, deficient of surfactant and not supported by a rigid chest wall. They are therefore highly susceptible to injury from the different types of respiratory support available for use in this population. Whereas pressure support ventilation (PSV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) have been used in neonatology for many years, newer modes of ventilation such as volume targeted ventilation (VTV) and, more recently, heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) have become popular. This review will look at the evidence available to assess the effectiveness of the different types of assisted ventilation techniques in preterm babies. Inhaled nitric oxide is a potent, selective pulmonary vasodilator. It has a clearly defined role in the management of pulmonary hypertension in term babies, where it has been shown to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. However, its role in preterm babies requiring invasive respiratory support is less well defined. Recently, a number of studies have been published looking at the effect of inhaled nitric oxide on the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm babies and its potential role in hypoxic respiratory failure. This review aims to determine the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide in preterm babies requiring invasive ventilation, both in hypoxic respiratory failure and in the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia In the NMA for the outcome of mortality prior to discharge and BPD at 36 weeks PMA there was no evidence to suggest a difference between between CPAP, NIPPV, BiPAP/SiPAP, or Hi Flow. Similarly, pairwise analyses did not identify any meaningful differences between non-invasive ventilation techniques. The committee acknowledged two existing non-UK economic evaluations comparing CPAP with NIPPV and Hi Flow, respectively. However, these analyses did not include all non-invasive ventilation techniques of interest. Given the lack of differences in the clinical effectiveness between non-invasive ventilation techniques and the lack of existing economic evidence the committee considered it important to compare the costs of the techniques to aid considerations of cost effectiveness. Generally the NHS Reference Costs (DHSC, 2018) is the recommended source of unit cost data that should be used to aid considerations of cost effectiveness. However, the committee explained that the neonatal activity payments are based on the level of activity (that is, intensive care, high dependency and special care) rather than procedures. As a result, costings of non-invasive ventilation techniques were undertaken to aid considerations of cost effectiveness and included equipment acquisition costs, maintenanece costs and consumable costs. The results of conventional pairwise meta-analyses of direct evidence alone do not help to fully inform which invasive and non-invasive ventilation technique is most effective in preterm babies requiring respiratory support. Each pairwise comparison does not fully inform the choice between the different treatments and having a series of discrete pairwise comparisons can be incoherent and difficult to interpret. In addition, direct comparisons of treatments of clinical interest are not fully available, for all comparisons. To overcome these issues, a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed. Advantages of performing this type of analysis are as follows. It allows the synthesis of evidence on multiple treatments compared directly and indirectly without breaking randomisation. If treatment A has never been compared to treatment B in a head to head trial, but these two interventions have been compared to a common comparator, then an indirect treatment comparison can be derived using the relative effects of the two treatments versus the common comparator. Indirect estimates can be calculated whenever there is a path linking two treatments through a set of common comparators. All the randomised evidence is considered simultaneously within the same model. For every intervention in a connected network, a relative effect estimate (with its 95% credible intervals, CrIs) between any two interventions can be estimated. These estimates provide a useful clinical summary of the results and facilitate the formation of recommendations based on all relevant evidence, whilst appropriately accounting for uncertainty. Ranks of interventions may also be calculated. Estimates from the NMA can be used to directly parameterise treatment effectiveness in cost-effectiveness modelling of multiple treatments. Conventional fixed effect meta-analysis assumes that the relative effect of one treatment compared to another is the same across an entire set of trials. In a random effects model, it is assumed that the relative effects are different in each trial but that they are from a single common distribution and that this distribution is common across all sets of trials. NMA requires an additional assumption over conventional meta-analysis. The additional assumption is that intervention A has the same effect on people in trials of intervention A compared to intervention B as it does for people in trials of intervention A versus intervention C and so on. Thus, in an NMA, the assumption is that intervention A has the same effect across trials of A versus B, A versus C and so on. The terms indirect treatment comparisons, mixed treatment comparisons and NMA are used interchangeably. We use the term NMA as the network consists of both indirect treatment comparisons (some trials have a common comparator and some do not) and mixed treatment comparisons (with at least one closed loop, combination of direct and indirect evidence). The purpose of this analysis was to assess the consistency assumption in the network meta-analysis (NMA) model used to estimate the comparative effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation techniques in specialist neonatal respiratory care (SNRC) for babies born preterm. The outcomes included in this analysis were 1) mortality prior to discharge and 2) bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA).

In the absence of a head-to-head comparative study of the two treatment modalities, an indirect comparison of data from 2 independent but similar clinical trials was undertaken. METHODS: Two similar randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies were identified which evaluated either C1-INH(SC) (COMPACT; NCT01912456; 16 weeks) or C1-INH(IV) (CHANGE; NCT01005888; 14 weeks) vs. placebo (on-demand treatment only) for routine prevention of HAE attacks. Individual patient data from each trial were used to conduct an indirect comparison of treatment effects. Attack reductions (absolute and percent of mean/median number of monthly HAE attacks reduction over placebo) were compared between the two C1-INH formulations at approved/recommended doses: C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg twice weekly (n = 45) and 1000 U of C1-INH(IV) twice weekly (n = 22). Point estimates were adjusted using mixed and quantile regression models that controlled for study design. RESULTS: The absolute mean monthly numbers of HAE attack reductions were 3.6 (95% CI 2.9, 4.2) for C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg vs. placebo and 2.3 (1.4, 3.3) for C1-INH(IV) vs. placebo; between-product difference, 1.3 (0.1, 2.4; P = 0.034). The mean percent reduction in monthly attack rate was significantly greater with C1-INH(SC) as compared with C1-INH(IV) (84% vs. 51%; P < 0.001). The percentages of subjects experiencing ≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, and ≥ 90% reductions in monthly HAE attack rates versus placebo were significantly higher with C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg as compared to C1-INH(IV) 1000 U (≥ 50% reduction: 91% vs. 50%, odds ratio [OR] = 10.33, P = 0.003; ≥ 70% reduction: 84% vs. 46%, OR = 6.19, P = 0.005; ≥ 90% reduction: 57% vs. 18%, OR = 6.04, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of an indirect study comparison, this analysis suggests greater attack reduction with twice-weekly C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg as compared to twice-weekly C1-INH(IV) 1000 U for the routine prevention of HAE attacks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30899278,PMC6407188

Clinical trials for SMA type 1 therapies, onasemnogene abeparvovec (AVXS-101) and nusinersen, demonstrated meaningful improvements in efficacy (e.g., overall survival) but there were no head-to-head clinical trials assessing comparative efficacy. This study estimated the treatment effects of AVXS-101 relative to nusinersen for the treatment of SMA type 1. METHODS: Overall survival, event-free survival (no death or need to use permanent assisted ventilation), improvement in motor function [increase of ≥ 4 points in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) score from baseline], and motor milestone achievements (head control, rolling over, and sitting unassisted) reported in the onasemnogene abeparvovec (AVXS-101-CL-101; NCT02122952) and nusinersen (ENDEAR; NCT02193074) clinical trials were indirectly compared using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. RESULTS: Among symptomatic infants with SMA type 1, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one more death with AVXS-101 instead of nusinersen was 6.2 [95% confidence intervals (CI) = 4.1-12.2], and the probability of preventing death was 20% higher for patients treated with AVXS-101 than nusinersen [risk ratio (RR) = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3]. For event-free survival, the NNT to prevent one more event was 2.6 (95% CI 2.0-3.6) and RR was 1.6 (95% CI 1.4-1.9). For improvement in motor function, NNT was 3.5 (95% CI 2.6-5.3) and RR was 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.6). For milestone achievements, the NNTs were 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.9), 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.5), and 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.5); RRs 4.2 (95% CI 2.6-6.7), 7.8 (95% CI 3.6-17.0), and 11.2 (95% CI 5.1-24.5) for head control, rolling over, and sitting unassisted, respectively. Results were similar using the Bayesian approach. CONCLUSION: This indirect comparison (AVXS-101-CL-101 vs. ENDEAR) among symptomatic SMA type 1 infants suggests that AVXS-101 may have an efficacy advantage relative to nusinersen for overall survival, independence from permanent assisted ventilation, motor function, and motor milestones.

Additionally, to determine the feasibility of conducting a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to validate the meta-regression results. Methods: A published systematic literature review (SLR) identified studies evaluating the efficacy of cladribine tablets and alternative DMTs in the management of active RRMS. A series of meta-regression models were run with adjustment for baseline risk, fitted to data from the intention-to-treat cohorts of trials identified in the SLR.

RESULTS: A total of 310 patients in TOWER were included (blinatumomab, n = 203; standard of care chemotherapy, n = 107). After matching the listed baseline characteristics, the median OS was 9.3 months for blinatumomab and 7.7 months for InO (weighted log-rank test p = 0.4). The relative RMST at 12 months was 1.6 months longer for blinatumomab than for InO [95% CI (0.1, 3.2); p = 0.04]; at 20.7 months the RMST was not significantly different. The CR rates were similar [anchor-based difference = - 2.8%, 95% CI (- 17.5%, 11.9%); p = 0.71]. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for cross-trial differences, blinatumomab demonstrated a similar CR rate and potential OS benefit versus InO among adult patients with R/R ALL who received no more than one prior salvage therapy. Further studies are suggested to confirm this finding. FUNDING: Amgen.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",30758745,PMC6824351

The cost-effectiveness versus relevant comparator was assessed to support evidence-based decision making. Methods: A four health states Markov model was built: first, second line treatments, BSC and death. Benefits were measured in QALYs, and efficacy estimates were obtained from an indirect treatment comparison. A 10-year time horizon and a 3% undifferentiated discount rate were considered. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The costs of treating MRCC with Sunitinib were higher than Pazopanib and BSC. When comparing Sunitinib versus Pazopanib, the incremental benefit is small favoring Sunitinib (0.03 QALYs). The base case scenario shows an average ICER of PA versus BSC of US$62,327.11/QALY and of US$85,885/QALY for Sunitinib versus Pazopanib. The ICER was most sensitive to the OS relative to BSC, where evidence was associated to important bias. Conclusions: Sunitinib or Pazopanib can be considered cost-effective if a 3 GDP per-capita threshold is assumed. The decision between SU or PA is highly sensitive to the price of the drugs, rather than the outcomes. Therefore, the decision might be made based on cost-minimization exercise.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30758237,

METHODS: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective medication for moderate to severe UC. Since no comparative trials are available for direct comparison of vedolizumab vs adalimumab in UC, a systematic review of literature databases was conducted to identify randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the two drugs in patients with moderate to severe UC after failure of conventional treatment. Studies were screened for eligibility by two reviewers based on predefined inclusion criteria. Bucher's adjusted indirect comparison was used to compare vedolizumab and adalimumab indirectly through placebo as common comparator. RESULTS: One vedolizumab study (GEMINI 1) and three adalimumab studies (ULTRA 1, ULTRA 2 and M10-447) met the eligibility criteria. Baseline characteristics of the included populations were similar in biologic-naïve UC patients across study arms. Although no statistically significant differences between treatments were found for induction efficacy endpoints, there was a trend toward a benefit of vedolizumab over adalimumab. There were also no significant differences between treatments for any maintenance efficacy endpoints, with no clear trend favoring either agent. Vedolizumab exhibited statistically superior maintenance safety compared with adalimumab, with significant reductions in risks of adverse events (relative risk 0.67 [95% confidence interval 0.57-0.80]; p < .0001), serious adverse events (0.20 [0.09-0.42]; p < .0001) and adverse events leading to discontinuation (0.14 [0.05-0.43]; p = .0006).

This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to assess the comparative efficacy of ustekinumab, adalimumab, vedolizumab and infliximab in the maintenance of clinical response and remission after 1 year of treatment. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Key outcomes of interest were clinical response (CD activity index [CDAI] reduction of 100 points; CDAI-100) and remission (CDAI score under 150 points; CDAI < 150). A treatment sequence Bayesian NMA was conducted to account for the re-randomization of patients based on different clinical definitions, the lack of similarity of the common comparator for each trial and the full treatment pathway from the induction phase onwards. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs were identified. Ustekinumab 90 mg q8w was associated with statistically significant improvement in clinical response relative to placebo and vedolizumab 300 mg. For clinical remission, ustekinumab 90 mg q8w was associated with statistically significant improvement relative to placebo and vedolizumab 300 mg q8w. Findings from sub-population analyses had similar results but were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The NMA suggest that ustekinumab is associated with the highest likelihood of reaching response or remission at 1 year compared with placebo, adalimumab and vedolizumab. Results should be interpreted with caution because this is a novel methodology; however, the treatment sequence analysis may be the most methodologically sound analysis to derive estimates of comparative efficacy in CD in the absence of head-to-head evidence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Treatment sequence Bayesian NMA""]}",30727745,

Novel therapies, such as fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin plus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, may contribute to better glycemic control. In the analysis presented here, the present analysis assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness of two fixed-ratio combinations, IDegLira (insulin degludec/liraglutide) and iGlarLixi (insulin glargine/lixisenatide), for the treatment of patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with basal insulin from a healthcare payer perspective in the Czech Republic. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Treatment effects were obtained from an indirect treatment comparison as no head-to-head data for IDegLira versus iGlarLixi are currently available. IDegLira was compared with two iGlarLixi pens (100 U/mL insulin glargine + 33 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL of lixisenatide, respectively). Direct medical costs associated with pharmaceutical interventions, screening and diabetes-related complications were captured. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with gains in life expectancy of 0.11 years and in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.14 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) versus iGlarLixi, due to a lower cumulative incidence and delayed onset of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was also associated with higher projected costs due to higher acquisition costs; however, these were partially offset by cost savings from avoided complications. IDegLira was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Czech Koruna (CZK) 695,998 and CZK 348,323 per QALY gained versus iGlarLixi pens containing 33 and 50 μg/mL of lixisenatide, respectively. These ratios were below the commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold of CZK 1,200,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: The present analysis indicated that IDegLira was associated with clinical benefits relative to iGlarLixi over patient lifetimes and was likely to be cost-effective in the treatment of patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin in the Czech Republic.

We illustrate with motivating examples two methods for the creation of historical controls where disease progression and overall survival are typically the key clinically meaningful endpoints. The first method utilises information routinely collected in a clinical trial programme: patients' time to disease progression on their previous line of treatment against which outcomes can be compared. The second uses published clinical outcomes for the prior line of treatment which can be extrapolated to estimate outcomes at the next line. As examples we use two pharmaceuticals licensed on the basis of uncontrolled clinical studies - idelalisib for double-refractory follicular lymphoma and ofatumumab for double-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Although subject to limitations that should be considered on a case-by-case basis, the methods may be appropriate when trying to quantify the clinical benefit of treatment based on limited and uncontrolled trial data.

The present study compared the efficacy of two IV iron formulations in patients with IDA: iron isomaltoside (IIM) and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). METHODS: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IIM and FCM in patients with IDA. An adjusted indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of IIM and FCM was then conducted to evaluate differences in change from baseline hemoglobin and the proportion of patients achieving a clinically-relevant response. RESULTS: The SLR identified no completed RCTs of IIM versus FCM, 5 RCTs of IIM (4 versus oral iron and 1 versus iron sucrose), and 14 RCTs of FCM (11 versus oral iron and 3 versus iron sucrose). In an ITC via iron sucrose, IIM resulted in a significantly larger increase from baseline hemoglobin with a mean difference of +0.249 g/dL with IIM relative to FCM, but there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with a clinically-relevant response. CONCLUSIONS: IIM resulted in a larger increase from baseline hemoglobin than FCM in patients with IDA, but with no difference in the proportion of patients responding.

An increasing number of biologic treatments, including biosimilars, are available for the treatment of spondyloarthritis. Although there are a growing number of randomised controlled trials assessing treatments in spondyloarthritis, there is a paucity of data from head-to-head studies. Comparative data are required so that clinicians and payers have the level of evidence required to inform clinical decision-making and health economic assessments. In the absence of head-to-head studies, statistical methods such as network meta-analyses and matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) are used for assessing comparative effectiveness.Network meta-analysis can be used to compare treatments for trials using a common comparator (e.g. placebo); however, for those without a common comparator or where considerable heterogeneity exists between the study populations, a MAIC that controls for differences in study design and baseline patient characteristics may be used. MAICs, unlike network meta-analyses, are of value for longer-term comparisons beyond the placebo-controlled phase of clinical trials, which is important for chronic diseases requiring long-term treatment, like spondyloarthritis. At present, there are a number of limitations that restrict the effectiveness of MAIC, such as the poor availability of individual patient-level data from trials, which results in patient-level data from one trial being compared with published whole-population data from another. Despite these limitations, drug reimbursement agencies are increasingly accepting MAIC as a means of comparative effectiveness and greater methodological guidance is needed.This report highlights a number of challenges that are specific to conducting comparative studies like MAIC in spondyloarthritis, including disease heterogeneity, the paucity of biomarkers and the duration of studies required for radiographic endpoints in this slow-progressing disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""May give subject specific limitations of MAIC, for discussion""]}",30670074,PMC6341745

These methods are challenged when differences between studies exist, including inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome definitions, patient characteristics, as well as ensuring the choice of a common comparator. OBJECTIVES: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) can address these challenges, but the appropriate application of MAICs is uncertain. Examples include whether to match between individual-level data and aggregate-level data studies separately for treatment arms or to combine the arms, which matching algorithm should be used, and whether to include the control treatment outcome and/or covariates present in individual-level data. RESULTS: Results from seven matching approaches applied to a continuous outcome in six simulated scenarios demonstrated that when no effect modifiers were present, the matching methods were equivalent to the unmatched Bucher approach. When effect modifiers were present, matching methods (regardless of approach) outperformed the Bucher method. Matching on arms separately produced more precise estimates compared with matching on total moments, and for certain scenarios, matching including the control treatment outcome did not produce the expected effect size. The entropy balancing approach was used to determine whether there were any notable advantages over the method proposed by Signorovitch et al. When unmeasured effect modifiers were present, no approach was able to estimate the true treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the Bucher approach (no matching), the MAICs examined demonstrated more accurate estimates, but further research is required to understand these methods across an array of situations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",30661638,

Methods: A model comparing P + C versus C alone is developed utilizing partitioned survival analysis. Primary clinical efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility and safety data are derived from the KEYNOTE-407 trial and projected over 20 years. Costs for drugs and non-drug disease management are also incorporated. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of P + C vs. pembrolizumab monotherapy (P) is evaluated via an indirect treatment comparison, for patient subgroups with PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50% and 1-49%. Results: Overall, P + C is projected to increase life expectancy by 1.95 years vs. C (3.86 versus 1.91). The resultant ICER is $86,293/QALY. In patients with PD-L1 ≥ 50%, 1-49% and <1 the corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are $99,777/QALY, $85,986/QALY and $87,507/QALY, respectively. Versus P, in the PD-L1 ≥ 50% subgroup, P + C appears cost saving; however, this result should be interpreted with caution as there is considerable uncertainty in the relative efficacy of these comparators. Conclusions: Across all eligible patients, the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is projected to approximately double life expectancy, yielding an extension to a point not previously seen in metastatic squamous NSCLC. Overall, and within all relevant PD-L1 subgroups, use of P + C yields an ICER below $100,000/QALY, and can be a cost-effective first-line treatment for eligible metastatic squamous NSCLC patients for whom chemotherapy is currently administered. In the PD-L1 ≥ 50% subgroup, additional follow-up within trials of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and pembrolizumab monotherapy are needed to better define cost-effectiveness between these comparators.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30649973,

Recently a new tissue repair technique has been proposed by Desarda and studied in trials against Lichtenstein technique. METHODS: The present study was performed according to the PRISMA Statement for Network Meta-analysis and the AMSTAR 2 checklist. The method of network meta-analysis was chosen to evaluate randomized controlled trial published on tissue repair and comparing Lichtenstein respectively with Desarda and Shouldice techniques. The following parameters: operative time, recurrence, complications (general, intraoperative, Surgical Surgical Site Occurrences), VAS score on postoperative day 1, numbness, chronic pain and return to daily activities. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs, involving 2791 patients, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were selected for final analysis. The anchored indirect treatment comparison showed that Desarda's technique requires a significantly shorter operative time (MD: -12.9 min; 95% CI: -20.6 to -5.2) and has a quicker recovery (MD: -6.6 days; 95% CI: -11.7 to -1.4). Outcomes concerning intraoperative complications, early postoperative pain, seroma/hematoma, hydrocele and infection rates, recurrence, numbness and chronic pain were similar among the two techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Desarda's hernia repair can be a valuable alternative to Shouldice technique for the treatment of primary inguinal hernia repair if a non-mesh technique is chosen, because of its reproducibility and quicker postoperative recovery. We recommend performing well designed prospective studies comparing both techniques directly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30639473,

We aimed to determine the association between treatment effects on early changes in albuminuria and treatment effects on clinical endpoints and surrograte endpoints, to inform the use of albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint in future randomised controlled trials. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we searched PubMed for publications in English from Jan 1, 1946, to Dec 15, 2016, using search terms including ""chronic kidney disease"", ""chronic renal insufficiency"", ""albuminuria"", ""proteinuria"", and ""randomized controlled trial""; key inclusion criteria were quantifiable measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria at baseline and within 12 months of follow-up and information on the incidence of end-stage kidney disease. We requested use of individual patient data from the authors of eligible studies. For all studies that the authors agreed to participate and that had sufficient data, we estimated treatment effects on 6-month change in albuminuria and the composite clinical endpoint of treated end-stage kidney disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL/min per 1·73 m(2), or doubling of serum creatinine. We used a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression analysis to relate the treatment effects on albuminuria to those on the clinical endpoint across studies and developed a prediction model for the treatment effect on the clinical endpoint on the basis of the treatment effect on albuminuria. FINDINGS: We identified 41 eligible treatment comparisons from randomised trials (referred to as studies) that provided sufficient patient-level data on 29 979 participants (21 206 [71%] with diabetes). Over a median follow-up of 3·4 years (IQR 2·3-4·2), 3935 (13%) participants reached the composite clinical endpoint. Across all studies, with a meta-regression slope of 0·89 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0·13-1·70), each 30% decrease in geometric mean albuminuria by the treatment relative to the control was associated with an average 27% lower hazard for the clinical endpoint (95% BCI 5-45%; median R(2) 0·47, 95% BCI 0·02-0·96). The association strengthened after restricting analyses to patients with baseline albuminuria of more than 30 mg/g (ie, 3·4 mg/mmol; R(2) 0·72, 0·05-0·99]). For future trials, the model predicts that treatments that decrease the geometric mean albuminuria to 0·7 (ie, 30% decrease in albuminuria) relative to the control will provide an average hazard ratio (HR) for the clinical endpoint of 0·68, and 95% of sufficiently large studies would have HRs between 0·47 and 0·95. INTERPRETATION: Our results support a role for change in albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint for the progression of chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with high baseline albuminuria; for patients with low baseline levels of albuminuria this association is less certain.

Mobile phone interventions to promote healthier behaviors (mobile health, mHealth) have the potential to reach a large number of people at a low cost. It has been hypothesized that mHealth interventions may not be as effective as face-to-face strategies in achieving smoking cessation, but there is no systematic evidence to support this, especially among PLHIV. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare two modes of intervention delivery (mHealth vs face-to-face) for smoking cessation among PLHIV. METHODS: Literature on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating effects of mHealth or face-to-face intervention strategies on short-term (4 weeks to <6 months) and long-term (≥6 months) smoking abstinence among PLHIV was sought. We systematically reviewed relevant RCTs and conducted pairwise meta-analyses to estimate relative treatment effects of mHealth and face-to-face interventions using standard care as comparison. Given the absence of head-to-head trials comparing mHealth with face-to-face interventions, we performed adjusted indirect comparison meta-analyses to compare these interventions. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies involving 1772 PLHIV met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the study population was 45 years, and women comprised about 37%. In the short term, mHealth-delivered interventions were significantly more efficacious in increasing smoking cessation than no intervention control (risk ratio, RR, 2.81, 95% CI 1.44-5.49; n=726) and face-to-face interventions (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.13-4.72; n=726).

In terms of achieving long-term results among PLHIV, there was no significant difference in the rates of smoking cessation between those who received mHealth-delivered interventions, face-to-face interventions, or no intervention. Trial sequential analysis showed that only 15.16% (726/1304) and 5.56% (632/11,364) of the required information sizes were accrued to accept or reject a 25% relative risk reduction for short- and long-term smoking cessation treatment effects. In addition, sequential monitoring boundaries were not crossed, indicating that the cumulative evidence may be unreliable and inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with face-to-face interventions, mHealth-delivered interventions can better increase smoking cessation rate in the short term. The evidence that mHealth increases smoking cessation rate in the short term is encouraging but not sufficient to allow a definitive conclusion presently. Future research should focus on strategies for sustaining smoking cessation treatment effects among PLHIV in the long term.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30617044,PMC6329415

To date, no formal guidance has been developed regarding how such adjustments should be made. We compared various covariate-adjusted survival modeling approaches, as applied to the ENDEAVOR trial in multiple myeloma that assessed carfilzomib plus dexamethasone (Cd) versus bortezomib plus dexamethasone (Vd). METHODS: Overall survival (OS) data and baseline characteristics were used for a subgroup (bortezomib-naïve/one prior therapy). Four adjusted survival modeling approaches were compared: propensity score weighting followed by fitting a Weibull model to the two arms of the balanced data (weighted data approach); fitting a multiple Weibull regression model including prognostic/predictive covariates to the two arms to predict survival using the mean value of each covariate and using the average of patient-specific survival predictions; and applying an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) derived from a Cox proportional hazard model to the baseline risk estimated for Vd. RESULTS: The mean OS estimated by the weighted data approach was 6.85 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.62-10.70) for Cd, 4.68 years (95% CI 3.46-6.74) for Vd, and 2.17 years (95% CI 0.18-5.06) for the difference. Although other approaches estimated similar differences, using the mean value of covariates appeared to yield skewed survival estimates (mean OS was 7.65 years for Cd and 5.40 years for Vd), using the average of individual predictions had limited external validity (implausible long-term OS predictions with > 10% of the Vd population alive after 30 years), and using the adjusted HR approach overestimated uncertainty (difference in mean OS was 2.03, 95% CI - 0.17 to 6.19). CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted survival modeling based on weighted or matched data approaches provides a flexible and robust method to correct for covariate imbalances in economic evaluations. The conclusions of our study may be generalizable to other settings.

The impact of missing outcome data on the meta-analysis summary effect can be explored by assuming a relationship between the outcome in the observed and the missing participants via an informative missingness parameter. The informative missingness parameters cannot be estimated from the observed data, but they can be specified, with associated uncertainty, using evidence external to the meta-analysis, such as expert opinion. The use of informative missingness parameters in pairwise meta-analysis of aggregate data with binary outcomes has been previously implemented in Stata by the metamiss command. In this article, we present the new command metamiss2, which is an extension of metamiss for binary or continuous data in pairwise or network meta-analysis.

Unlike previous NMA that used meta-regression to account for potential confounding by systematic variation in treatment effect modifiers across studies, this update incorporated individual patient-level data (IPD) regression to provide more robust adjustment. METHODS: An updated review was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials for inclusion in a Bayesian NMA. The network included intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL) 2 mg bimonthly (2q8) after 5 initial doses, ranibizumab 0.5 mg as-needed (PRN), ranibizumab 0.5 mg treat-and-extend (T&E), and laser photocoagulation. Outcomes included in the analysis were change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), measured using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, and patients with ≥10 and ≥ 15 ETDRS letter gains/losses at 12 months. Analyses were performed using networks restricted to IPD-only and IPD and aggregate data with (i) no covariable adjustment, (ii) covariable adjustment for baseline BVCA assuming common interaction effects (against reference treatment), and (iii) covariable adjustments specific to each treatment comparison (restricted to IPD-only network). RESULTS: Thirteen trials were included in the analysis. IVT-AFL 2q8 was superior to laser in all analyses. IVT-AFL 2q8 showed strong evidence of superiority (95% credible interval [CrI] did not cross null) versus ranibizumab 0.5 mg PRN for mean change in BCVA (mean difference 5.20, 95% CrI 1.90-8.52 ETDRS letters), ≥15 ETDRS letter gain (odds ratio [OR] 2.30, 95% CrI 1.12-4.20), and ≥10 ETDRS letter loss (OR 0.25, 95% CrI 0.05-0.74) (IPD and aggregate random-effects model with baseline BCVA adjustment). IVT-AFL 2q8 was not superior to ranibizumab 0.5 mg T&E for mean change in BCVA (mean difference 5.15, 95% CrI -0.26-10.61 ETDRS letters) (IPD and aggregate random-effects model). CONCLUSIONS: This NMA, which incorporated IPD to improve analytic robustness, showed evidence of superiority of IVT-AFL 2q8 to laser and ranibizumab 0.5 mg PRN.

The aims of this review were to 1) explain why we cannot compare trial-specific NNT estimates for the competing treatments evaluated in different randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2) outline the principles of how relative treatment effects of different trials can be compared and results can be presented as NNT, without violating the principles of valid between-trial comparisons. Our premise is that ratio measures for relative treatment effects of response outcomes are less prone to effect modification than absolute difference measures of response outcomes. Accordingly, any between-trial comparisons of the efficacy of competing interventions using the study-specific ORs are less likely to be invalid or biased than comparisons based on the study-specific NNT estimates. However, treatment-specific ORs obtained from a meta-analysis or taken directly from an individual study can be transformed into consistent treatment-specific NNT estimates that allow for credible comparisons of treatments when these ratio measures are applied to the same reference response estimate. The theoretical discussion is illustrated with a relevant indirect comparison of biologics for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Between-trial comparisons directly based on the NNT of individual trials may result in erroneous conclusions and should be avoided. Treatment-specific NNT estimates need to be based on the same probability of response with the common reference treatment against which the interventions are compared.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",30588048,PMC6298880

METHODS: Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in prior sunitinib-treated patients with mRCC were compared by conducting matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) analyses, including base-case and sensitivity analyses. Individual patient-level data from prior sunitinib-treated patients who received axitinib in AXIS were weighted to match published baseline characteristics of prior sunitinib-treated patients who received either cabozantinib or everolimus in METEOR. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in PFS (aHR [adjusted hazard ratio] = 1.15 [CI: 0.82-1.63]) and OS (aHR = 1.00 [CI: 0.69-1.46]) between axitinib versus cabozantinib in the base-case analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, PFS (aHR = 1.39 [CI: 1.00-1.92]) and OS (aHR = 1.35 [CI: 0.95-1.92]) were shorter for axitinib compared with cabozantinib; however, the OS difference was not statistically significant. Axitinib was associated with significantly longer PFS compared with everolimus in the base-case (aHR = 0.53 [CI: 0.36-0.80]) and sensitivity analyses (aHR = 0.63 [CI: 0.45-0.88]), respectively. Results suggested an OS benefit for axitinib versus everolimus in base-case analyses (aHR = 0.63 [CI: 0.42-0.96]); however, the difference in OS in the sensitivity analysis was not statistically significant (aHR = 0.84 [CI: 0.59-1.18]). CONCLUSIONS: MAIC analyses suggest PFS and OS for axitinib and cabozantinib are dependent on the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center definition used; in the base-case analysis, there was no significant difference in PFS and OS between axitinib and cabozantinib. In the sensitivity analysis, PFS in favour of cabozantinib was significant; however, the trend for prolonged OS with cabozantinib was not significant. For axitinib and everolimus, MAIC analyses indicate patients treated with axitinib may have an improved PFS and OS benefit when compared to everolimus. Disparities between the base-case and sensitivity analyses in this study underscore the importance of adjusting for the differences in baseline characteristics and that naïve indirect comparisons are not appropriate.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",30567533,PMC6300002

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's submission (CS) to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the CS for pembrolizumab was based on one phase II, single-arm, open-label, non-randomised study (KEYNOTE-052), while the evidence for the comparator (carboplatin plus gemcitabine) was based on four studies, including one randomised controlled trial and three cohort studies. In the absence of head-to-head trials, the company conducted an indirect treatment comparison for both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), by firstly adjusting cross-study differences using a simulated treatment comparison approach and then synthesizing the evidence based on an assumption of constant hazard ratios using a standard meta-analysis model and time-varying hazard ratios using fractional polynomial models. The treatment effect of pembrolizumab was more favourable in the adjusted population compared with the observed effect in the KEYNOTE-052 study. The company submitted a de novo partitioned survival cohort simulation model, which partitions the OS time into PFS and post-progression survival. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for pembrolizumab compared with carboplatin plus gemcitabine was estimated to be £37,081 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, based on the results within the company's health economic model. Following a critique of the model, for their preferred base case the ERG corrected some minor model errors, chose a progression approach for estimating utilities, and revised the extrapolation of PFS and OS. The ERG's probabilistic base case ICER was estimated to be £67,068 per QALY gained. The ERG also undertook a range of exploratory sensitivity analyses which suggested that the ICER was highly uncertain. In particular, the choices of extrapolation for the OS of pembrolizumab and the stopping rule for pembrolizumab had the largest impacts on the ICER. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended pembrolizumab for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for treating locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had platinum-containing chemotherapy, provided that pembrolizumab was stopped at 2 years of uninterrupted treatment, or earlier if the disease progresses, and the conditions of the managed access agreement for pembrolizumab are followed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Find the article for which this technology appraisal is about""]}",30547369,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Disease progression was simulated with a partitioned survival model developed from the parameterization and extrapolation of survival curves of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- ABC from clinical trials with ribociclib or palbociclib, both in combination with letrozole. The model was structured on the basis of three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, and death), with a 1-month cycle length and inclusion of subsequent treatments administered for disease progression, over a time horizon of 15 years. Clinical, economic, and quality of life parameters were drawn from clinical trials and the literature. The use of resources and clinical practice in the Spanish setting was validated by a panel of experts. The Spanish NHS perspective was adopted, taking into account exclusively direct health costs from 2017 expressed in Euros. Drug prices used were the reported ex-factory prices. Uncertainty of the parameters and robustness of the results were evaluated using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (2,000 iterations). RESULTS: This cost-effectiveness analysis showed a greater benefit (0.437 and 0.285 life-years gained [LYGs] and quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] gained, respectively) and a slightly higher cost (€439.86) for ribociclib+letrozole compared to palbociclib+letrozole. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios were €1,007.69 per LYG and €1,543.62 per QALY gained, respectively. The results of the multiple sensitivity analyses showed limited dispersion of the outcomes, thus corroborating their robustness. CONCLUSION: From the NHS perspective, considering the most commonly established willingness-to-pay thresholds in the Spanish setting, ribociclib+letrozole would represent a cost-effective therapeutic option compared to palbociclib+letrozole in the first-line treatment of HR+/HER2- ABC in postmenopausal women.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30532569,PMC6241542

Until recently, TNF-alpha-inhibitors have been the only biologics approved for the treatment of active AS. The objective of this study was to assess the potential financial impact of the first non-TNF-alpha biologic secukinumab (fully human IL-17A-inhibitor) vs adalimumab (TNF-alpha-inhibitor) in the treatment of AS in Finland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this model-based budget impact analysis, patients were treated either with secukinumab (150 mg) or adalimumab (40 mg). The number of patients and market share of different biologics were based on national reimbursement registry data. Adalimumab was the most commonly used biologic treatment for AS, and in the base case analysis all adalimumab patients are assumed to switch to secukinumab. Response rates were based on a matching-adjusted indirect comparison between secukinumab and adalimumab. Patients not achieving response were switched to another biologic treatment. RESULTS: Treating AS patients with secukinumab instead of adalimumab leads to potential savings of 18.2 million euros within a 5-year time period. The total costs within the follow-up time were 59.5 million euros and 77.7 million euros with and without secukinumab, respectively. According to sensitivity analyses, a higher adoption rate of secukinumab corresponds to higher potential savings. CONCLUSIONS: Secukinumab is a cost-saving treatment option compared with adalimumab in the treatment of AS in Finland. More patients could be treated with a biologic by allocating resources more efficiently.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc",30474450,

Topical therapy is considered the treatment mainstay for mild-to-moderate disease according to guidelines. Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) [0.005%/0.05%] aerosol foam is indicated for psoriasis vulgaris treatment in adults. Cal/BD foam trials demonstrated improved efficacy and similar safety in this population. Psoriasis treatment is complicated by the broad range of disease presentation, variability and therapeutic options; particularly decisions on transition from topical to non-biologic systemic treatment are difficult. Assessing comparative effectiveness of treatment options provides meaningful value to treatment decisions. OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy of Cal/BD foam individual patient data from pooled trials with efficacy of non-biologic systemic treatments based on aggregated patient characteristics and treatment outcomes. METHODS: Individual data from four Cal/BD foam trials in 749 psoriasis patients were pooled to conduct matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. Literature review identified non-biologic systemic treatment trials where methods, populations and outcomes align with Cal/BD foam trials. Of 3090 screened publications, four studies of apremilast, methotrexate, acitretin or fumaric acid esters (FAE) were included. RESULTS: After baseline matching, patients treated with 4 weeks of Cal/BD foam had greater Physician's Global Assessment 0/1 response compared to those treated with 16 weeks of apremilast (52.7% vs. 30.4%; P < 0.001).

The BMJ Technology Assessment Group (BMJ-TAG) was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG), reviewing the submission from the company. The Decision Support Unit (DSU) was commissioned to review additional evidence submitted by the company and to undertake further analyses. This article presents the critical review of the company's submissions by the ERG and DSU, further analyses undertaken by the DSU, and the outcome of the NICE guidance. The clinical effectiveness for dinutuximab beta was derived from a phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) that assessed the safety and efficacy of the addition of interleukin (IL)-2 to dinutuximab beta plus isotretinoin. This trial did not inform the relative effectiveness of dinutuximab beta versus isotretinoin alone, which was established practice in the UK for maintenance treatment. In the absence of direct evidence, the company initially conducted a naïve indirect treatment comparison against a historical control, and later performed a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) against the isotretinoin arm of an RCT comparing dinutuximab alpha and isotretinoin. The company submitted a partitioned survival analysis model that calculated the incremental cost effectiveness of dinutuximab beta versus isotretinoin. The company's original incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £22,338 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. However, the ERG were concerned that the company's ICER was not suitable for decision making, and thus carried out initial exploratory analysis as a first step to overcome the naïve estimation of treatment effectiveness in the model. The ERG's analysis estimated an ICER of £111,858 per QALY gained. In their revised analysis incorporating the MAIC and other changes as requested by the appraisal committee, the company's ICER was £24,661 per QALY gained. When the DSU incorporated longer-term isotretinoin data and made corrections to the model, the ICER increased to between £62,886 and £87,164 per QALY gained depending on the choice of survival model. A confidential Patient Access Scheme (PAS) decreased the ICERs. The ICERs with the PAS were over £40,000 per QALY gained, but the NICE committee additionally considered the patient population and its size, the disease severity, the potential for significant survival benefit and uncaptured health benefits, and recommended dinutuximab beta as a treatment option, subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the PAS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Find the original article for which this review is about""]}",30465228,

Thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists have recently emerged as promising therapies for ITP patients who are refractory to other treatments. While eltrombopag (EPAG) is the only TPO-R agonist US Food and Drug Administration approved for use in pediatric patients, romiplostin (ROMI) has been used in Phase III clinical studies. METHODS: A cost-consequence model (CCM) was developed to evaluate the costs of EPAG, ROMI, and watch-and-rescue (W&R) in relation to their respective treatment outcomes in previously-treated pediatric chronic ITP (cITP) over a 26-week time horizon. The costs of drugs, administration, routine care, rescue medications, adverse events, and mortality were included. Data on platelet count response rate, bleeding events, and adverse events were derived from all relevant identified Phase III-registered clinical trials, health outcomes were compared via indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: The overall estimated cost of EPAG per patient was US$66,550, compared to US$101,056 for ROMI and US$32,720 for W&R. EPAG's lower cost compared to ROMI was largely due to lower drug costs (US$62,202 vs US$84,396), administration costs (US$0 vs US$1,955), and significantly lower costs due to severe bleeding (US$354 vs US$10,191). When assessing cost per severe bleeding event avoided, EPAG was dominant over ROMI (less expensive and more effective). EPAG was again dominant over ROMI when assessing the cost per responder and per bleeding event (any grade). Sensitivity analysis was consistent with the base case findings. CONCLUSION: EPAG was the preferred TPO-R agonist to treat cITP when indirectly compared to ROMI, largely driven by its favorable severe bleeding outcomes and lower drug and administration costs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30464564,PMC6223346

METHODS: A cost-consequence model was developed to evaluate the costs relative to treatment success of EPAG, ROMI, and watch and rescue (W&R) in previously treated patients. The primary endpoint assessed was severe bleeding, derived from all identified phase III registered clinical trials. Health outcomes were compared via indirect treatment comparison. Costs incorporated in the model included drug and administration, routine care, rescue medications, bleeding-related adverse events, other adverse events, and mortality costs. A trial (26-week) time horizon was used, as certain endpoints used in the model were bound to within-trial results. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, the overall estimated cost per patient for EPAG was US$66,560 compared to US$91,039 for ROMI and US$30,099 for W&R. Compared to the ITT population, the difference in cost between EPAG and ROMI was slightly greater in splenectomized patients (US$65,998 for EPAG compared to US$91,485 for ROMI) and slightly less in non-splenectomized patients (US$67,151 for EPAG compared to US$91,455 for ROMI), though the overall trend remained the same. When assessing cost per severe bleeding event avoided in the ITT population, EPAG dominated (less expensive, more effective) ROMI. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. CONCLUSION: EPAG was preferred over ROMI in the treatment of cITP, largely driven by the reduction in severe bleeding events associated with its use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""To read just to check that this kind of articles is not doing any paitc""]}",30464563,PMC6219311

The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the class effect of beta-blocker use in patients with COPD. We will focus on a broad range of endpoints including, clinical, safety, and patient-centric outcomes such as health related quality of life (HRQoL) and functional capacity. A secondary objective is to explore potential within-class variation in the effects of beta-blockers among patients with COPD, and rank individual agents according to their relative benefit(s). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases will be systematically searched, from inception to present, to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and other prospective and interventional studies of beta-blocker use in patients with COPD which report on the outcomes of interest. Relative treatment effects with respect to mortality, COPD exacerbations, all-cause hospitalisation, lung function, HRQoL and exercise capacity will be summarised by meta-analysis. Individual treatments (agents) will be compared in a Bayesian network meta-analysis including RCT and observational data, if feasible.

It is licensed for repair of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and the patella of the knee with defect sizes up to 10 cm(2) in adults. In a single technology appraisal (STA) [TA508] undertaken by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Warwick Evidence was the Evidence Review Group (ERG) invited to independently review the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, Co.Don. The clinical effectiveness data came from their COWISI randomised controlled trial (RCT), which compared Chondrosphere with microfracture (MF). The timing of this appraisal was unfortunate given that MF was no longer the most relevant comparator because NICE had contemporaneously published guidance approving ACI in place of MF. Moreover, the COWISI RCT enrolled mostly patients with small defect sizes. Evidence of clinical effectiveness for Chondrosphere used in people with larger defect size came from another RCT, which compared three doses of Chondrosphere and that by design could not provide evidence comparing Chondrosphere to any other forms of ACI. To estimate the relative clinical performance of Chondrosphere versus other ACI, Co.Don conducted an indirect treatment comparison by network meta-analyses (NMA). The NMA was flawed in that the distribution of population characteristics that are effect modifiers greatly differed across the treatment comparisons of the network. The ERG questioned both the appropriateness of the NMA and the validity of the resulting estimates. Co.Don estimated the cost-effectiveness of Chondrosphere using a lifetime Markov model with all patients receiving the first repair during the first cycle of the model then moving into one of three health states: success, no further repair (NFR), or a second repair, if necessary. Subsequent to the first cycle, those who were a success either remained a success or moved to second repair. All those in NFR remained in NFR. The cost-effectiveness of Chondrosphere compared to other ACI forms relied on the clinical effectiveness estimates of success and failure rates obtained from the company's indirect comparisons, the validity of which the ERG questioned. The company revised cost-effectiveness estimates for Chondrosphere versus MF and for Chondrosphere versus matrix-applied characterised autologous cultured chondrocyte implant (MACI) were £4360 and around £18,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained, respectively. NICE recommended ACI using Chondrosphere for treating symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and patella of the knee in adults only if certain requirements were met.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30426462,

METHODS: Pooled individual patient data from the secukinumab arms of MEASURE 1 (NCT01358175) and MEASURE 2 (NCT01649375) trials (n=197) were matched against the ATLAS (NCT00085644) adalimumab population (n=208). Logistic regression analysis was used to determined weights to match for age, sex, Bath AS Functional Index, C-reactive protein levels, and previous tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy. Recalculated Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 20 and 40 responses at weeks 8, 12, 16, 24, and 52 from MEASURE 1/2 (effective sample size=120) were compared with those of ATLAS. Anchored (placebo-adjusted) comparisons were possible until week 12, and unanchored (non-placebo-adjusted) comparisons were necessary thereafter. RESULTS: For placebo-anchored ASAS 20 and 40 comparisons up to week 12, there were no differences between secukinumab and adalimumab. For unanchored comparisons at week 16, ASAS 20 was higher for secukinumab [odds ratio 1.60 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.54); p=0.047]; at week 24, ASAS 20 and 40 were higher for secukinumab [1.76 (1.11-2.79); p=0.017 and 1.79 (1.14-2.82); p=0.012, respectively]; and at week 52, ASAS 40 was higher for secukinumab [1.54 (1.06-2.23); p=0.023] than for adalimumab.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically reviewed 74 randomized controlled trials (74,832 participants) published up to 15 November 2017, which compared any of the interventions (SAMA [ipratropium], LAMA [aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium, umeclidinium], LAMA/LABA [aclidinium/formoterol, indacaterol/glycopyrronium, tiotropium/olodaterol, umeclidinium/vilanterol] and ICS/LABA [fluticasone/vilanterol, budesonide/formoterol, salmeterol/fluticasone]) with each other or with placebo. A random-effects network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect evidence was conducted to examine the change from baseline in trough FEV(1), transition dyspnea index, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and frequency of adverse events at weeks 12 and 24. RESULTS: Inconsistency models were not statistically significant for all outcomes. LAMAs, LAMA/LABAs and ICS/LABAs led to a significantly greater improvement in trough FEV(1) compared with placebo and SAMA monotherapy at weeks 12 and 24. All LAMA/LABAs, except aclidinium/formoterol, were statistically significantly better than LAMA monotherapy and ICS/LABAs in improving trough FEV(1). Among the LAMAs, umeclidinium showed statistically significant improvement in trough FEV(1) at week 12 compared to tiotropium and glycopyrronium, but the results were not clinically significant. LAMA/LABAs had the highest probabilities of being ranked the best agents in FEV(1) improvement. Similar trends were observed for the transition dyspnea index and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire outcomes. There were no significant differences in the incidences of adverse events among all treatment options. CONCLUSION: LAMA/LABA showed the greatest improvement in trough FEV(1) at weeks 12 and 24 compared with the other inhaled drug classes, while SAMA showed the least improvement.

This study aimed to identify and analyze evidence supporting the use of the emerging magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) compared to alternative stimulatory and ablative interventions for the treatment of medication-refractory essential tremor: radiofrequency thalamotomy, unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS), and stereotactic radiosurgery. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify clinical, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and economic evidence for each intervention. Because of the lack of comparative evidence captured, a feasibility assessment was performed to determine possible comparisons between interventions, and newly established matching-adjusted indirect comparison and simulated treatment comparison techniques were used to conduct a comparison between unilateral DBS aggregate data and MRgFUS individual patient data. RESULTS: The systematic literature review identified 1,559 records, and screening yielded 46 relevant articles. The captured studies demonstrated that radiofrequency thalamotomy, DBS, stereotactic radiosurgery, and MRgFUS all exhibit clinical efficacy, with variation in onset and duration of tremor relief, and are each associated with a unique safety profile. The matching-adjusted indirect comparison and simulated treatment comparison results demonstrated no evidence of a difference in efficacy (measured by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Total) and HRQoL (measured by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Part C) outcomes between MRgFUS and unilateral DBS in the short term (≤12 months). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that MRgFUS could elicit similar short-term tremor- and HRQoL-related benefits to DBS, the current standard of care, and allowed for the first robust statistical comparison between these interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",30314617,

Approval of tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, represents a new and potentially curative treatment option. However, tisagenlecleucel is expensive, with a current list price of $475 000 per one-time administration. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term survival and value of tisagenlecleucel for children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a decision analytic model was designed to extrapolate trial evidence to a patient lifetime horizon. The survival evidence for the model was extracted from 3 studies: B2202 (enrolled patients from April 8, 2015, to November 23, 2016), B2205J (enrolled patients from August 14, 2014, to February 1, 2016), and B2101J (enrolled patients from March 15, 2012, to November 30, 2015). Long-term survival and outcomes of patients younger than 25 years with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse were derived using flexible parametric modeling from the direct extrapolation of event-free survival and overall survival curves. The published Kaplan-Meier curves were digitized from November 1, 2017, to November 30, 2017, using an algorithm to impute patient-level time-to-event data. Sensitivity and scenario analyses assessed uncertainty in the evidence and model assumptions to further bound the range of cost-effectiveness. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: The primary intervention of interest was tisagenlecleucel. The comparator of interest was the chemoimmunotherapeutic agent clofarabine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Model outcomes included life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental costs per life-year and QALY gained. RESULTS: Forty percent of patients initiating treatment with tisagenlecleucel are expected to be long-term survivors, or alive and responding to treatment after 5 years. Tisagenlecleucel had a total discounted cost of $667 000, with discounted life-years gained of 10.34 years and 9.28 QALYs gained. The clofarabine comparator had a total discounted cost of approximately $337 000, with discounted life-years gained of 2.43 years and 2.10 QALYs gained. This difference resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately $42 000 per life-year gained and approximately $46 000 per QALY gained for tisagenlecleucel vs clofarabine. These results were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Across scenario analyses that included more conservative assumptions regarding long-term relapse and survival, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $37 000 to $78 000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Tisagenlecleucel likely provides gains in survival and seems to be priced in alignment with these benefits. This study suggests that payers and innovators should develop novel payment models that reduce the risk and uncertainty around long-term value and provide safeguards to ensure high-value care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",30304407,PMC6583018

Pembrolizumab was recently approved in the US for the treatment of such patients having demonstrated clinical benefit and tolerability in relapsed/refractory cHL; however, the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab in this population is currently unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-state Markov model (progression-free [PF], progressed disease, and death) was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab (200 mg) vs brentuximab vedotin (BV; 1.8 mg/kg) in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL after ASCT who have not received BV post-ASCT over a 20-year time horizon from a US payer perspective. PF survival was modeled using a naïve indirect treatment comparison of data from KEYNOTE-087 and the SG035-003 trial. Post-progression survival was modeled using data from published literature. Costs (drug acquisition and administration, disease management, subsequent treatment, and adverse events) and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3.0%. Uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness was assessed via probabilistic, deterministic, and scenario analyses. RESULTS: In the base case, pembrolizumab was predicted to yield an additional 0.574 life-years (LYs) and 0.500 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) vs BV and cost savings of $63,278. Drug acquisition costs were the biggest driver of incremental costs between strategies. Pembrolizumab had a 99.6% probability of being cost-effective compared with BV at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000/QALY and dominated BV in all scenarios tested. LIMITATIONS: The analysis was subject to potential bias due to the use of a naïve indirect treatment comparison and, given the current immaturity of OS in KEYNOTE-087, PPS was assumed equivalent across both treatments. CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab is a cost-effective alternative to BV for patients with relapsed/refractory cHL after ASCT.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30303022,

The CRD (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) and CHE (Centre for Health Economics) Technology Assessment Group at the University of York was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the Company's submission (CS), the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The evidence submitted in support of ceritinib, as the first-line treatment in ALK+ advanced NSCLC, was a phase III, international, multicentre, open-label randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing ceritinib with pemetrexed/cisplatin plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy (chemotherapy [CT] group). The results indicated that ceritinib prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with CT. The only comparator considered in the CS was crizotinib. The evidence selected in support of crizotinib was PROFILE 1014, an open-label RCT of crizotinib, compared with pemetrexed/cisplatin CT (without maintenance therapy), in previously untreated advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC. The design and population of PROFILE 1014 was similar to that of ASCEND-4, though there were some differences between the trials. The Company considered it not possible to perform an 'anchor-based' analysis of first-line ceritinib and crizotinib, and presented a Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) of ceritinib and crizotinib using only the ALK inhibitor arm of ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. The indirect comparison suggests that ceritinib may be more effective in prolonging PFS than crizotinib. The ERG agreed that an indirect comparison using only the ALK inhibitor arm of the trials was the only option available in the present assessment; however, a number of limitations and potential bias were identified in this analysis. The Company's model estimated that ceritinib was cost effective when compared with crizotinib. However, the ERG highlighted several concerns with the Company's analysis; the ERG's preferred base case estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £69,255 per quality-adjusted life-year (no patient access scheme [PAS] included). The ERG considered the economic analysis to be sensitive to changes in assumption used, partly due to the due to the immaturity of the overall survival data from trials, which leads to uncertainty around the extrapolation used. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that ceritinib is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for untreated ALK+ advanced NSCLC in adults, if the Company provides it with the discount agreed in the PAS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Find the original article this is about""]}",30298279,

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG), which produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's submission to NICE. Nivolumab was compared with docetaxel, paclitaxel, best supportive care and retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin plus gemcitabine, but only for patients whose disease has had an adequate response in first-line treatment). Two ongoing, phase I/II, single-arm studies for nivolumab were identified, but no studies directly compared nivolumab with any specified comparator. Evidence from directly examining the single arms of the trial data indicated little difference between the outcomes measured from the nivolumab and comparator studies. A simulated treatment comparison (STC) analysis was used in an attempt to reduce the bias induced by naïve comparison, but there was no clear evidence that risk of bias was reduced. Multiple limitations in the STC were identified and remained. The effect of an analysis based on different combinations of covariates in the prediction model remains unknown. The ERG's concerns regarding the economic analysis included the use of a non-established response-based survival analysis method, which introduced additional uncertainty. The use of time-dependent hazard ratios produced overfitting and was not represented in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The use of a treatment stopping rule to cap treatment cost left treatment effectiveness unaltered. A relevant comparator was excluded from the base-case analysis. The revised ERG deterministic base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on the company's Appraisal Consultation Document response were £58,791, £78,869 and £62,352 per quality-adjusted life-year gained versus paclitaxel, docetaxel and best supportive care, respectively. Nivolumab was dominated by cisplatin plus gemcitabine in the ERG base case. Substantial uncertainties about the relative treatment effectiveness comparing nivolumab against all comparators remained. NICE did not recommend nivolumab, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had platinum-containing therapy, and considered that nivolumab was not suitable for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Find the original article this is about""]}",30293207,

A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted to estimate the relative efficacy of these agents in the crizotinib-refractory setting. METHODS: MAIC is a propensity score-type method that adjusts for differences in baseline characteristics between trials to estimate relative efficacy. Analyses were based on patient-level data from the ALTA trial for brigatinib and published summary-level trial data from ASCEND-1 and ASCEND-2 for ceritinib and NP28761 and NP28673 for alectinib. Objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared. RESULTS: After matching, all key baseline characteristics were balanced between trials. Compared with ceritinib, brigatinib was associated with longer PFS (ASCEND-1: median 15.7 vs 6.9 months, hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval] = 0.38 [0.26-0.57]; ASCEND-2: median = 18.3 vs 7.2 months, HR = 0.33 [0.20-0.56]) and OS (ASCEND-1: not available; ASCEND-2: median 27.6 vs 14.9 months, HR = 0.33 [0.17-0.63]).

However, there are no clinical trials that have directly compared these agents. We conducted a systematic review and indirectly compared the efficacy of azacitidine to decitabine in MDS. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of several databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus) through June 28, 2018, without language or time restrictions. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers, and differences were resolved by consensus. The fixed effect model and adjusted indirect comparison methods were used to pool relative risks (RR) of major outcomes of interest (mortality, response rate, quality of life, hematologic improvement, hospitalization, leukemia transformation, transfusion independence). RESULTS: Only four trials met the eligibility criteria. Two trials compared azacitidine to the best supportive care (BSC) and included 549 patients, and the other two compared decitabine to BSC and included 403 patients. The risk of bias was unclear overall. Compared to BSC, azacitidine was significantly associated with lower mortality (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.94, I(2) = 89%) whereas decitabine did not significantly reduce mortality (RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.00, I(2) = 53%). Both drugs were associated with higher partial and complete response compared to BSC. Indirect comparisons were not statistically significant for all the studied outcomes, except for complete response where azacitidine was less likely to induce complete response compared to decitabine (RR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.01-0.86, very low-certainty evidence). CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine and decitabine are both associated with improved outcomes compared to BSC. The available indirect evidence comparing the two agents warrants very low certainty and cannot reliably confirm the superiority of either agent. Head-to-head trials are needed. In the meantime, the choice of agent should be driven by patient preferences, adverse effects, drug availability, and cost.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30227896,PMC6145118

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical effectiveness of three interventions [everolimus (Afinitor(®); Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland), lutetium-177 DOTATATE (177Lu-DOTATATE) (Lutathera(®); Imaging Equipment Ltd, Radstock, UK) and sunitinib (Sutent(®); Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA)] for treating unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease progression and establish the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched from inception to May 2016: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily, Epub Ahead of Print, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS: We systematically reviewed the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness literature on everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib for treating advanced, unresectable or metastatic progressive NETs. The following NET locations were considered separately: pancreas, gastrointestinal (GI) tract and lung, and GI tract (midgut only). We wrote a survival partition cohort-based economic evaluation in Microsoft Excel(®) 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) from the UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. This comprised three health states: (1) progression-free survival (PFS), (2) progressed disease and (3) death. RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), RADIANT-3 [RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Third Trial; pancreatic NETs (pNETs): everolimus vs. best supportive care (BSC)], A6181111 (pNETs: sunitinib vs. BSC) and RADIANT-4 (RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Fourth Trial; GI and lung NETs: everolimus vs. BSC), met the inclusion criteria for the clinical effectiveness systematic review. The risk of bias was low. Although the NETTER-1 (Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy) RCT, of 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 mg of octreotide (Sandostatin(®), Novartis) compared with 60 mg of octreotide, was excluded from the review, we nonetheless present the results of this trial, as it informs our estimate of the cost-effectiveness of 177Lu-DOTATATE. The pNETs trials consistently found that the interventions improved PFS and overall survival (OS) compared with BSC. Our indirect comparison found no significant difference in PFS between everolimus and sunitinib. Estimates of OS gain were confounded because of high rates of treatment switching. After adjustment, our indirect comparison suggested a lower, but non-significant, hazard of death for sunitinib compared with everolimus. In GI and lung NETs, everolimus significantly improved PFS compared with BSC and showed a non-significant trend towards improved OS compared with BSC. Adverse events were more commonly reported following treatment with targeted interventions than after treatment with BSC. In the base case for pNETs, assuming list prices, we estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for everolimus compared with BSC of £45,493 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and for sunitinib compared with BSC of £20,717 per QALY. These ICERs increased substantially without the adjustment for treatment switching. For GI and lung NETs, we estimated an ICER for everolimus compared with BSC of £44,557 per QALY. For GI (midgut) NETs, the ICERs were £199,233 per QALY for everolimus compared with BSC and £62,158 per QALY for a scenario analysis comparing 177Lu-DOTATATE with BSC. We judge that no treatment meets the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) end-of-life criteria, although we cannot rule out that sunitinib in the A6181111 trial does. LIMITATIONS: A RCT with included comparators was not identified for 177Lu-DOTATATE. The indirect treatment comparison that our economic analysis was based on was of a simple Bucher type, unadjusted for any differences in the baseline characteristics across the two trials. CONCLUSIONS: Given NICE's current stated range of £20,000-30,000 per QALY for the cost-effectiveness threshold, based on list prices, only sunitinib might be considered good value for money in England and Wales. FUTURE WORK: Further analysis of individual patient data from RADIANT-3 would allow assessment of the robustness of our findings. The data were not made available to us by the company sponsoring the trial. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42016041303.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the efficacy of licensed doses of mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab in patients with SEA, according to baseline blood eosinophil counts. METHODS: This indirect treatment comparison (ITC) used data from a Cochrane review and independent searches. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials in patients aged 12 years or greater with SEA. End points included annualized rate of clinically significant exacerbations and change from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire score and FEV(1). An ITC was performed in patients with Asthma Control Questionnaire scores of 1.5 or greater and stratified by baseline blood eosinophil count. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included. All treatments significantly reduced the rate of clinically significant exacerbations and improved asthma control versus placebo in all blood eosinophil count subgroups. Mepolizumab reduced clinically significant exacerbations by 34% to 45% versus benralizumab across subgroups (rate ratio ≥400 cells/μL: 0.55 [95% CI, 0.35-0.87]; ≥300 cells/μL: 0.61 [95% CI, 0.37-0.99]; and ≥150 cells/μL: 0.66 [95% CI, 0.49-0.89]; all P < .05) and by 45% versus reslizumab in the 400 cells/μL or greater subgroup (rate ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.36-0.85]; P = .007). Asthma control was significantly improved with mepolizumab versus benralizumab (all subgroups: P < .05) and versus reslizumab in the 400 cells/μL or greater subgroup (P = .004). Benralizumab significantly improved lung function versus reslizumab in the 400 cells/μL or greater subgroup (P = .025). CONCLUSIONS: This ITC of the licensed doses suggests that mepolizumab was associated with significantly greater improvements in clinically significant exacerbations and asthma control compared with reslizumab or benralizumab in patients with similar blood eosinophil counts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30205189,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model is developed utilizing partitioned survival analysis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of KEYNOTE-189 trial comparators pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed) vs chemotherapy alone. Clinical efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility, and safety data are derived from the trial and projected over 20 years. For extrapolating survival beyond the trial, a novel SEER population-data approach is applied (primary analysis), with separate estimation via traditional parametric extrapolation methods. Costs for drugs and non-drug disease management are also incorporated. Based on an indirect treatment comparison, cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs pembrolizumab monotherapy is evaluated for patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) ≥ 50%. RESULTS: In the full non-squamous population, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is projected to increase life expectancy by 2.04 years vs chemotherapy (3.96 vs 1.92), for an approximate doubling of life years. Resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are $104,823/QALY and $87,242/life year. In patients with PD-L1 ≥ 50% and 1-49%, life expectancy is more than doubled (4.53 vs 1.88 years) and (4.87 vs 2.01 years), with a 32% (2.60 vs 1.97 years) increase in PD-L1 < 1% patients. Corresponding incremental costs/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are $103,402, $66,837, and $183,529 for PD-L1 ≥ 50%, 1-49%, and <1% groups, respectively. Versus pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 ≥ 50% patients, representing current standard of care, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy increases life expectancy by 65% (4.53 vs 2.74 years) at an ICER of $147,365/QALY. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is projected to extend life expectancy to a point not previously seen in previously untreated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Although ICERs vary by sub-group and comparator, results suggest pembrolizumab + chemotherapy yields ICERs near, or in most cases, well below a 3-times US per capita GDP threshold of $180,000/QALY, and may be a cost-effective first-line treatment for metastatic non-squamous NSCLC patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30188231,

The direct comparison meta-analysis found that macrolides decreased the rate of exacerbation of non-CF bronchiectasis (risk ratio (RR) = 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.55) with heterogeneity ( I(2) = 63.7%, p = 0.064). The AITC showed that azithromycin had a significantly lower bronchiectasis exacerbation rate than erythromycin (RR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.403-0.947). Azithromycin increased the risk of diarrhea and abnormal pain. This meta-analysis suggested that long-term treatment with macrolides significantly reduced the incidence of non-CF bronchiectasis exacerbation. Moreover, azithromycin is more efficient than roxithromycin and erythromycin in preventing exacerbation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30101613,PMC6302979

METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and Opengrey.eu were searched for RCTs of AEDs used to treat post-stroke epilepsy. The following outcomes were considered: seizure freedom; occurrence of adverse effects (AEs); withdrawal for AEs. The methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Adjusted indirect comparisons were made between each AED using controlled-release carbamazepine (CR-CBZ) as common comparator. RESULTS: Only 2 RCTs were included, one comparing levetiracetam (LEV) with CR-CBZ and the other comparing lamotrigine (LTG) with CR-CBZ. No significant difference was found in seizure freedom between either LEV or LTG and CR-CBZ. Occurrence of AEs were lower for LEV and LTG than for CR-CBZ. Indirect comparisons showed no difference between LEV and LTG for seizure freedom (OR 0.86; 95%CI: 0.15-4.89). Occurrence of AEs was higher for LEV than for LTG (OR 6.87; 95%CI: 1.15-41.1). For withdrawal rates due to AEs, we found a large width and asymmetrical distribution of confidence intervals around the obtained OR of 10.8 (95% CI: 0.78-149.71). CONCLUSIONS: Direct and indirect comparisons did not find a difference in seizure freedom between the various AEDs, probably because of the small number of patients included. LEV and LTG appears better tolerated than CR-CBZ and LEV seems associated with more AEs than LTG. Further studies are required to provide robust evidence on efficacy and tolerability of AEDs for treating poststroke epilepsy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",30096625,

To characterize the overall benefit-risk profile in 3L CP-CML patients treated with bosutinib vs. ponatinib, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to compare efficacy outcomes and treatment duration after adjusting for trial subjects' baseline characteristics, and tolerability was assessed with an unadjusted comparison of study-drug discontinuation. METHODS: The MAIC was performed using published data from the pivotal bosutinib trial and the most recent individual-patient-level data on file from the pivotal ponatinib trial. RESULTS: Responses were more frequent and durable with ponatinib (n = 70 MAIC-adjusted) than with bosutinib (n = 119) - complete cytogenetic response (CCyR): 61% vs. 26%; Kaplan-Meier estimate of maintaining CCyR at 4 years: 89% vs. 54%. Median treatment duration was longer with ponatinib than with bosutinib: 38.4 vs. 8.6 months. Only 9% of ponatinib patients (n = 97 unadjusted) vs. 42% of bosutinib patients discontinued due to death, disease progression or unsatisfactory response; 19% vs. 24% discontinued due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these surrogate measures of patient benefit-risk profiles, ponatinib appears to provide a net overall benefit vs. bosutinib in 3L CP-CML.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",30086654,

To determine whether trial outcomes translate into similar event rates in unselected patients, this analysis compared outcomes from the real-world XANTUS study with those from the Phase III ROCKET AF study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual patient data from 4020 XANTUS patients were re-weighted to match the proportion of selected baseline characteristics in 7061 rivaroxaban-treated patients from ROCKET AF, using the matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) method. For the primary analysis, CHADS2 scores and gender were selected as relevant variables. Adjusted annualized incidence rates for XANTUS were calculated and compared with incidence rates from ROCKET AF-the ratio of these rates ('MAIC ratio') was used as a relative effect estimate. Rates of major bleeding [3.10%/year vs. 3.60%/year; MAIC ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-1.12] and stroke/non-central nervous system systemic embolism (1.54%/year vs. 1.70%/year; MAIC ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.62-1.32) were similar between XANTUS and ROCKET AF. The rate of all-cause death was higher in XANTUS (3.22%/year vs. 1.87%/year; MAIC ratio 1.72; 95% CI 1.31-2.27), but the rates of vascular death were similar (1.83%/year vs. 1.53%/year; MAIC ratio 1.19; 95% CI 0.84-1.70). Sensitivity analyses weighted by different baseline characteristics supported these results. CONCLUSION: The low rates of major bleeding and stroke in XANTUS were consistent with results from ROCKET AF. All-cause death, but not vascular death, was higher in XANTUS, as expected in an unselected real-world population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",30052894,

This summary presents the perspective of Warwick Evidence, the Evidence Review Group (ERG) appointed by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the single technology appraisal of pembrolizumab for this indication. Pembrolizumab is manufactured by Merck, Sharp and Dohme (MSD). The major source of clinical effectiveness was the KEYNOTE-045 trial, where 542 patients received either pembrolizumab or clinician's choice of docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine as a second-line treatment. No indirect treatment comparison was performed. The clinical effectiveness was assessed using hazard ratios for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, together with the subpopulations positive for programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (combined positive score [CPS] ≥ 1%) and strongly positive for PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 10%). In the ITT population, OS improved with pembrolizumab (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91) while PFS outcomes showed no difference (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81-1.19). Pembrolizumab demonstrated a better safety profile than its combined comparators, with fewer patients experiencing adverse events (60.9 vs 90.2%). Similar results were observed in populations expressing PD-L1. MSD estimated the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab using a de novo partitioned survival model. The model had three health states: pre-progression, post-progression and death, where OS and PFS estimates excluded patients who received vinflunine. The largest uncertainty was over the selection of the parametric models used to extrapolate OS and PFS and the time point for when to begin their extrapolation. The company preferences for extrapolation were not well supported and the ERG disagreed with their selection for OS. Utility values were also contentious, with the company preferring to use pooled time-to-death-based utilities pooled across treatment arms, whilst the ERG preferred pooled progression-based utilities. The company preferred to use data from patients receiving vinflunine when calculating the utility values, which the ERG disagreed with as this is not recommended treatment within the UK. The company assumed a lifetime treatment effect for their model; however, the lack of evidence made it difficult to confidently provide a realistic estimate of treatment effect duration. Various durations were explored (3, 5 and 10 years). The first appraisal committee meeting concluded that pembrolizumab was not cost effective, largely due to uncertainty in the OS and PFS extrapolations. The company's second submission included an additional 4 months follow-up to survival data. The company in this new submission maintained their original assumptions in their base-case analysis, changing only the choice of parametric curve for PFS. This change resulted in the OS and PFS curves intersecting at 6 years in the pembrolizumab arm, at which point PFS identically followed OS. This resulted in no patients in the post-progression health state beyond this time point, and therefore, the majority of pembrolizumab's benefit came from pre-progression survival. Given the unclear PFS benefit, the ERG found this implausible and maintained their original base-case model assumptions. Considerable uncertainty remained over the specification of the extrapolations and the duration of treatment effect. Based on a new-value proposition submitted by the company, the appraisal committee concluded that pembrolizumab had plausible potential to be cost effective. Pembrolizumab was referred for funding through the Cancer Drugs Fund, so that further data could be collected with the aim of diminishing the outstanding uncertainties pertaining to its clinical effectiveness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""find original article""]}",30030817,

DESIGN: Systematic literature synthesis. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION: English language papers that used indirect comparison meta-analytic methods to study the efficacy or safety of three or more interventions, where at least one was a drug. DATA EXTRACTION: The number of publications and authors was plotted by year and type: methodological contribution, review or empirical application. Author and methodological details were summarised for empirical applications, and animated coauthorship networks were created to visualise contributors by country and affiliation type (academia, industry, government or other) over time. RESULTS: We identified 477 papers (74 methodological contributions, 42 reviews and 361 empirical applications) by 1689 distinct authors from 1997 to 2013. Prior to 2002, only three applications were published, with contributions from the USA (n=2) and Canada (n=1). The number of applications gradually increased annually with rapid uptake between 2011 and 2013 (n=254, 71%). Early diffusion occurred primarily in Europe with the first application credited to the UK in 2003. Application spread to other European countries in 2005, and may have been supported by regulatory requirements for drug approval. By the end of 2013, contributions included 49% credited to Europe (22% UK, 27% other), 37% credited to North America (11% Canada, 26% USA) and 14% from other regions. CONCLUSION: Indirect comparison meta-analytic methods are an important innovation for health research. Although Canada and the USA were the first to apply these methods, Europe led their diffusion. The increase in uptake of these methods may have been facilitated by acceptance by regulatory agencies, which are calling for more comparative drug effect data to assist in drug accessibility and reimbursement decisions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,no_paitc",29961001,PMC6045745

DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA). DATA SOURCES: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, Cochrane Database, Web of Science and WHO Clinical Trials Platform were searched from their inception until January 2018. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with PHP investigating common treatments (ie, corticosteroid injection, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, therapeutic exercise, orthoses and/or extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)) compared with each other or a no treatment, placebo/sham control. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted and checked for accuracy and completeness by pairs of reviewers. Primary outcomes were pain and function. Comparative treatment effects were analysed by random effects NMA in the short term, medium term and long term. Relative ranking of treatments was assessed by surface under the cumulative ranking probabilities (0-100 scale). RESULTS: Thirty-one RCTs (total n=2450 patients) were included. There was no evidence of inconsistency detected between direct and indirect treatment comparisons in the networks, but sparse data led to frequently wide CIs. Available evidence does not suggest that any of the commonly used treatments for the management of PHP are better than any other, although corticosteroid injections, alone or in combination with exercise, and ESWT were ranked most likely to be effective for the management of short-term, medium-term and long-term pain or function; placebo/sham/control appeared least likely to be effective; and exercise appeared to only be beneficial for long-term pain or function. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is equivocal regarding which treatment is the most effective for the management of PHP. Given limited understanding of long-term effects, there is need for large, methodologically robust multicentre RCTs investigating and directly comparing commonly used treatments for the management of PHP.

Head-to-head evidence is limited in many disease areas, regularly resulting in disconnected evidence structures where a large number of treatments are available. This is also the case in the evidence of treatments for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) identified in a systematic literature review form two disconnected evidence networks. Standard Bayesian NMA models are fitted to obtain estimates of relative effects within each network. Observational evidence was identified to fill the evidence gap. Single armed trials are matched to act as each other's control group based on a distance metric derived from covariate information. Uncertainty resulting from including this evidence is incorporated by analysing the space of possible matches. RESULTS: Twenty five randomised controlled trials form two disconnected evidence networks; 12 single armed observational studies are considered for bridging between the networks. Five matches are selected to bridge between the networks. While significant variation in the ranking is observed, daratumumab in combination with dexamethasone and either lenalidomide or bortezomib, as well as triple therapy of carfilzomib, ixazomib and elozumatab, in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, show the highest effects on progression free survival, on average. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis shows how observational data can be used to fill gaps in the existing networks of RCT evidence; allowing for the indirect comparison of a large number of treatments, which could not be compared otherwise. Additional uncertainty is accounted for by scenario analyses reducing the risk of over confidence in interpretation of results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29954322,PMC6022299

A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to assess the comparative efficacy of treatments among patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic NSCLC. METHODS: Randomized trials of dabrafenib + trametinib, docetaxel, erlotinib, nintedanib + docetaxel, nivolumab, pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, and best supportive care as second-line or above treatments for advanced or metastatic NSCLC identified in a systematic literature review were included in the NMA. Overall response rates (ORRs) and disease control rates (DCRs) were compared using logit models; progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared using fractional polynomial hazards models. Dabrafenib + trametinib was linked into the evidence network through a matching-adjusted indirect comparison versus nivolumab. RESULTS: Ten trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the NMA. Dabrafenib + trametinib, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab were associated with the highest odds of achieving overall response (12.2, 1.2, and 0.7 times higher, respectively, compared with docetaxel).

In this work, we aimed to assess the relative treatment effects of empagliflozin versus sitagliptin and saxagliptin (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors) on cardiovascular-related outcomes in patients with T2DM. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify clinical trials assessing cardiovascular-related outcomes for sitagliptin-, saxagliptin-, and empagliflozin-treated patients with T2DM. A network meta-analysis of indirect treatment comparisons was conducted in a Bayesian framework. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI) were computed for six cardiovascular-related outcomes to estimate the relative efficacies of these agents. RESULTS: Empagliflozin showed a statistically significant superiority over saxagliptin (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.46-0.80) and sitagliptin (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.46-0.79) to reduce the risk for cardiovascular-related mortality. For all-cause mortality, empagliflozin showed a statistically significant risk reduction compared to saxagliptin (HR 0.61; 95% CrI 0.49-0.76) and sitagliptin (HR 0.67; 95% CrI 0.54-0.83). A similar pattern was observed in the risk reduction for hospitalization due to heart failure, where empagliflozin was found to be statistically significantly superior to saxagliptin (HR 0.51; 95% CrI 0.37-0.70) and sitagliptin (HR 0.65; 95% CrI 0.47-0.90). Empagliflozin was not statistically significantly different to sitagliptin and saxagliptin with regard to the risk of a composite endpoint composed of death, stroke or myocardial infarction.

Population differences can lead to biased results by classical indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) aims to correct these differences. We compared RIBO and PALBO in hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer using MAIC. METHODS: Patient-level data were available for RIBO (MONALEESA-2), while only published summary data were available for PALBO (PALOMA-2). Weights were assigned to MONALEESA-2 patient data such that mean baseline characteristics matched those reported for PALOMA-2; the resulting matched cohort was used in comparisons. Limited by the results reported in PALOMA-2, progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary comparison. Cox regression models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS, before indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was performed with 95% confidence intervals. An exploratory analysis was performed similarly for overall survival using earlier PALBO data (PALOMA-1). Grade 3/4 adverse events were also compared. RESULTS: Racial characteristics, prior chemotherapy setting, and the extent of metastasis were the most imbalanced baseline characteristics. The unadjusted PFS HRs were 0.556 (0.429, 0.721) for RIBO+LET versus LET alone and 0.580 (0.460, 0.720) for PALBO+LET versus LET alone. MAIC adjustment resulted in an HR of 0.524 (0.406, 0.676) for RIBO+LET versus LET. PFS ITC using unadjusted trial data produced an HR of 0.959 (0.681, 1.350) for RIBO versus PALBO, or 0.904 (0.644, 1.268) with MAIC. Unadjusted overall survival HR of RIBO versus PALBO was 0.918 (0.492, 1.710); while exploratory MAIC was 0.839 (0.440, 1.598). ITC of grade 3/4 adverse events yielded a risk ratio of 0.806 (0.604, 1.076).

Network estimates of effects on OS were consistent with reported comparisons with ADT alone for AAP [hazard ration (HR) = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.71], Doc (HR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.87), ZA + Cel (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.97), ZA + Doc (HR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94), Cel (HR = 0.94 95% CI 0.75-1.17) and ZA (HR = 0.90 95% CI 0.79-1.03). The effect of ZA + Cel is consistent with the additive effects of the individual treatments. Results suggest that AAP has the highest probability of being the most effective treatment both for OS (94% probability) and failure-free survival (100% probability). Doc was the second-best treatment of OS (35% probability). CONCLUSIONS: Uniquely, we have included all available results and appropriately accounted for inclusion of multi-arm, multi-stage trials in this AD-NMA. Our results support the use of AAP or Doc with ADT in men with metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer. AAP appears to be the most effective treatment, but it is not clear to what extent and whether this is due to a true increased benefit with AAP or the variable features of the individual trials. To fully account for patient variability across trials, changes in prognosis or treatment effects over time and the potential impact of treatment on progression, a network meta-analysis based on individual participant data is in development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29788164,PMC5961275

Pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, is one possible treatment solution for this population. RESEARCH METHODS: The objective of this study was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) with standard of care (SOC) versus pembrolizumab in previously BV treated RRcHL patients. A systematic literature review identified one observational study of SOC that was suitable for comparison with KEYNOTE-087, the principal trial of pembrolizumab in this population. Both naïve and population-adjusted (using outcomes regression) pairwise indirect comparisons were conducted. The primary analysis included all patients who had failed BV, with a secondary analysis conducted including only those known to have failed BV that was part of definitive treatment. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, SOC was inferior to pembrolizumab in both the unadjusted comparison (HR 5.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.56-7.01]) and the adjusted comparison (HR 6.35 [95% CI 4.04-9.98]). These HRs increased to 5.16 (95% CI 3.61-7.38) and 6.56 (95% CI 4.01-10.72), respectively, in the secondary analysis. CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab offers a significant improvement in PFS compared to SOC in this population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""STC without mentioning it explicitely""]}",29764245,

METHODS: Targeted reviews of PubMed, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Highly Specialised Technologies (HST), and the Scottish Medicines Consortium's (SMC's) ultra-orphan submissions were performed. RESULTS: A total of 19 PubMed studies, 3 published NICE HSTs, and 11 ultra-orphan SMC submissions were eligible for inclusion. In rare diseases, a number of different factors may affect the model's ability to comply with good practice recommendations. Many products for the treatment of rare diseases have an incomplete efficacy and safety profile at product launch. In addition, there is often limited available natural history and epidemiology data. Information on the direct and indirect cost burden of an orphan disease also may be limited, making it difficult to estimate the potential economic benefit of treatment. These challenges can prevent accurate estimation of a new product's benefits in relation to costs. Approaches that can address such challenges include using patient and/or clinician feedback to inform model assumptions; data from disease analogues; epidemiological techniques, such as matching-adjusted indirect comparison; and long-term data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling in rare diseases is often challenging; however, a number of approaches are available to support the development of model structures and the collation of input parameters and to manage uncertainty.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",29753347,

The value of these novel therapies has so far been assessed with traditional metrics, but the different ways in which immuno-oncology therapies work can mean the full value is not captured. Immuno-oncology therapies can produce longer survival times but this effect can be delayed or even preceded by an apparent phase of progression, which median survival or response rates may not reflect.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: As a joint initiative between the British Society of Interventional Radiologists, the British Association of Urological Surgeons and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, we conducted the UK Register of Prostate Embolization (UK-ROPE) study, which recruited 305 patients across 17 UK urological/interventional radiology centres, 216 of whom underwent PAE and 89 of whom underwent TURP. The primary outcomes were International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) improvement in the PAE group at 12 months post-procedure, and complication data post-PAE. We also aimed to compare IPSS score improvements between the PAE and TURP groups, using non-inferiority analysis on propensity-score-matched patient pairs. The clinical results and urological measurements were performed at clinical sites. IPSS and other questionnaire-based results were mailed by patients directly to the trial unit managing the study. All data were uploaded centrally to the UK-ROPE study database. RESULTS: The results showed that PAE was clinically effective, producing a median 10-point IPSS improvement from baseline at 12 months post-procedure. PAE did not appear to be as effective as TURP, which produced a median 15-point IPSS score improvement at 12 months post-procedure. These findings are further supported by the propensity score analysis, in which we formed 65 closely matched pairs of patients who underwent PAE and patients who underwent TURP. In terms of IPSS and quality-of-life (QoL) improvement, there was no evidence of PAE being non-inferior to TURP. Patients in the PAE group had a statistically significant improvement in maximum urinary flow rate and prostate volume reduction at 12 months post-procedure. PAE had a reoperation rate of 5% before 12 months and 15% after 12 months (20% total rate), and a low complication rate. Of 216 patients, one had sepsis, one required a blood transfusion, four had local arterial dissection and four had a groin haematoma. Two patients had non-target embolization that presented as self-limiting penile ulcers. Additional patient-reported outcomes, pain levels and return to normal activities were very encouraging for PAE. Seventy-one percent of PAE cases were performed as outpatient or day cases. In contrast, 80% of TURP cases required at least 1 night of hospital stay, and the majority required 2 nights. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that PAE provides a clinically and statistically significant improvement in symptoms and QoL, although some of these improvements were greater in the TURP arm. The safety profile and quicker return to normal activities may be seen as highly beneficial by patients considering PAE as an alternative treatment to TURP, with the concomitant advantages of reduced length of hospital stay and need for admission after PAE. PAE is an advanced embolization technique demanding a high level of expertise, and should be performed by experienced interventional radiologists who have been trained and proctored appropriately. The use of cone-beam computed tomography is encouraged to improve operator confidence and minimize non-target embolizations. The place of PAE in the care pathway is between that of drugs and surgery, allowing the clinician to tailor treatment to individual patients' symptoms, requirements and anatomical variation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",29645352,

METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs); uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian) Intervals. RESULTS: Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83-1.28) or enzalutamide (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69-1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis. Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01-10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 1.41-75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03-10.09) were more likely to occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14-206.40). Frequentist analyses produced similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity of clinical studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29641566,PMC5895064

The efficacy of vaginal progesterone has been challenged after publication of the OPPTIMUM study. However, this has been resolved by an individual patient-data meta-analysis (Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2018;218:161-180). OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of vaginal progesterone and cerclage in preventing preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes in women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a midtrimester sonographic short cervix. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CINAHL (from their inception to March 2018); Cochrane databases, bibliographies, and conference proceedings. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing vaginal progesterone to placebo/no treatment or cerclage to no cerclage in women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a sonographic cervical length <25 mm. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Updated systematic review and adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis of vaginal progesterone vs cerclage using placebo/no cerclage as the common comparator. The primary outcomes were preterm birth <35 weeks of gestation and perinatal mortality. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Five trials comparing vaginal progesterone vs placebo (265 women) and 5 comparing cerclage vs no cerclage (504 women) were included. Vaginal progesterone, compared to placebo, significantly reduced the risk of preterm birth <35 and <32 weeks of gestation, composite perinatal morbidity/mortality, neonatal sepsis, composite neonatal morbidity, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (RRs from 0.29 to 0.68). Cerclage, compared to no cerclage, significantly decreased the risk of preterm birth <37, <35, <32, and <28 weeks of gestation, composite perinatal morbidity/mortality, and birthweight <1500 g (RRs from 0.64 to 0.70). Adjusted indirect comparison meta-analyses did not show statistically significant differences between vaginal progesterone and cerclage in the reduction of preterm birth or adverse perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSION: Vaginal progesterone and cerclage are equally effective for preventing preterm birth and improving perinatal outcomes in women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a midtrimester sonographic short cervix. The choice of treatment will depend on adverse events and cost-effectiveness of interventions and patient/physician's preferences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29630885,PMC6449041

However, summarising the evidence using traditional pairwise meta-analyses does not allow the inclusion of data from treatments that have not been compared head to head. Exclusion of such comparisons could impact the precision of pooled estimates in a meta-analysis. Hence, to address the challenge of whether aspirin alone or in addition to another antithrombotic agent is a more effective regimen to improve SVG patency, a network meta-analysis (NMA) is necessary. The objectives of this study are to synthesise the available evidence on antithrombotic agents (or their combination) and estimate the treatment effects among direct and indirect treatment comparisons on SVGF and major adverse cardiovascular events, and to generate a treatment ranking according to their efficacy and safety outcomes. METHODS: We will perform a systematic review of RCTs evaluating antithrombotic agents in patients undergoing CABG. A comprehensive English literature search will be conducted using electronic databases and grey literature resources to identify published and unpublished articles. Two individuals will independently and in duplicate screen potential studies, assess the eligibility of potential studies and extract data. Risk of bias and quality of evidence will also be evaluated independently and in duplicate. We will investigate the data to ensure its suitability for NMA, including adequacy of the outcome data and transitivity of treatment effects. We plan to estimate the pooled direct, indirect and the mixed effects for all antithrombotic agents using a NMA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Due to the nature of the study, there are no ethical concerns nor informed consent required. We anticipate that this NMA will be the first to simultaneously assess the relative effects of multiple antithrombotic agents in patients undergoing CABG. The results of this NMA will inform clinicians, patients and guideline developers the best available evidence on comparative effects benefits of antithrombotic agents after CABG while considering the side effect profile to support future clinical decision-making. We will disseminate the results of our systematic review and NMA through a peer-reviewed journal.

Currently, there exist Bayesian and multivariate modelling approaches to these analyses, but these are computationally intensive and rely on assumptions that may not be valid in practice. Here we introduce a generalized pairwise modelling (GPM) framework for network meta-analysis, so named as it is based on the repeated application of adjusted indirect comparisons, also known as the Bucher method. The validity of this method hinges on the sufficient similarity of the common control node (transitivity), and for the application in the GPM framework this requirement extends to all common nodes used to make an indirect comparison estimate. Apart from the assumption of sufficient similarity, the GPM framework assumes only standard arithmetic and statistical rules making it more robust when compared with existing methods for network meta-analysis. A software program (MetaXL; www.epigear.com) is available to run this framework, so it is easily accessible to researchers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",29621039,

The Association of British Neurologists guidelines currently recommend two infusion therapies, alemtuzumab and natalizumab, to treat high disease activity relapsing remitting MS (HDA-RRMS). This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets in HDA-RRMS compared with alemtuzumab and natalizumab, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model with 11 health states (10 Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] plus death) was developed. Transition matrices from the British Columbia registry were used to model the natural history of EDSS. The treatment effect on EDSS was modelled using hazard ratios for 6-month confirmed disability progression from an indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Relapses and drug-related adverse events were modeled via annualized relapse rates and event probabilities, with associated costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. Utilities were derived from trials and the literature, and costs from NHS and literature sources. Uncertainty was assessed via probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Cladribine tablets were dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) vs alemtuzumab and natalizumab in pairwise comparisons, and the dominant strategy in fully incremental analyses. Incremental cost was driven largely by drug acquisition and administration costs, and incremental QALY gain largely by differences in delayed EDSS progression. Cladribine tablets had a 93% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of GBP 30,000 per QALY gained, and remained dominant across the scenario analyses tested. The greatest influence on results was the treatment effect on disability progression derived from the ITC. LIMITATIONS: Uncertainty over the efficacy of DMT beyond trial durations. In line with other comparative effectiveness analyses, the network meta-analysis informing this cost-effectiveness analysis was associated with a degree of uncertainty. No treatment switching analyses were undertaken. CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine tablets are a cost-effective alternative to alemtuzumab and natalizumab in the treatment of HDA-RRMS from the perspective of the NHS in England.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29618273,

CONCLUSIONS: In our analysis, patients with PsA receiving secukinumab were more likely to achieve higher ACR responses through 1 year (weeks 16-48) than those treated with adalimumab. Although informative, these observations rely on a subgroup of patients from FUTURE 2 and thus should be considered interim until the ongoing head-to-head RCT EXCEED can validate these findings.

The Study to Assess Long-term Opioid Maintenance Effectiveness (SALOME) randomized controlled trial provided evidence that injectable hydromorphone is non-inferior to diacetylmorphine. The current study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of hydromorphone directly with diacetylmorphine and indirectly with methadone maintenance treatment. DESIGN: A within-trial analysis was conducted using the patient level data from the 6-month, double-blind, non-inferiority SALOME trial. A life-time analysis extrapolated costs and outcomes using a decision analytical cohort model. The model incorporated data from a previous trial to include an indirect comparison to methadone maintenance. SETTING: A supervised clinic in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 202 long-term street opioid injectors who had at least two attempts at treatment, including one with methadone (or other substitution), were randomized to hydromorphone (n = 100) or diacetylmorphine (n = 102). MEASUREMENTS: We measured the utilization of drugs, visits to health professionals, hospitalizations, criminal activity, mortality and quality of life. This enabled us to estimate incremental costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness ratios from a societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses considered different sources of evidence, assumptions and perspectives. FINDINGS: The within-trial analysis found hydromorphone provided similar QALYs to diacetylmorphine [0.377, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.361-0.393 versus 0.375, 95% CI = 0.357-0.391], but accumulated marginally greater costs [$49 830 ($28 401-73 637) versus $34 320 ($21 780-55 998)]. The life-time analysis suggested that both diacetylmorphine and hydromorphone provide more benefits than methadone [8.4 (7.4-9.5) and 8.3 (7.2-9.5) versus 7.4 (6.5-8.3) QALYs] at lower cost [$1.01 million ($0.6-1.59 million) and $1.02 million ($0.72-1.51 million) versus $1.15 million ($0.71-1.84 million)]. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe opioid use disorder enrolled into the SALOME trial, injectable hydromorphone provided similar outcomes to injectable diacetylmorphine. Modelling outcomes during a patient's life-time suggested that injectable hydromorphone might provide greater benefit than methadone alone and may be cost-saving, with drug costs being offset by costs saved from reduced involvement in criminal activity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29589873,

Currently available epidemiologic data suggest that non-herbal tea consumption may reduce OC risk, but these evidences are inconsistent. A comprehensive literature search for observational epidemiologic studies reporting associations between non-herbal tea consumption and OC risk was conducted in electronic databases. A random-effects model was used to synthesize effect measures in binary meta-analysis, and adjusted indirect comparison was used to compare whether there was a difference in effects between green tea (GT) and black tea (BT). Both linear and non-linear models were used to explore the dose-response relationship. Fourteen studies were included, and we obtained an inverse and significant pooled estimate in binary meta-analysis [risk ratio (RR)pool = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.95, PCochran < 0.001, I2 = 81.5%]. No publication bias was identified in binary meta-analysis. In binary meta-analysis stratified by tea types, we observed a significant association for GT (RRpool = 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.90, PCochran = 0.071, I2 = 53.6%), but not BT (RRpool = 0.85, 95% CI 0.65-1.12, PCochran = 0.007, I2 = 65.9%). Indirect comparison, which treated BT as the reference, showed an inverse but non-significant association (RRGT versus BT = 0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.15). Both linear and non-linear models found that OC risk decreased as the consumption levels of total non-herbal tea increased. However, the dose-response relationship was stronger for GT when compared with BT. Our results suggest that non-herbal tea, especially GT, is associated with a reduced risk of OC. Future studies should explore biochemical evidence regarding the variation in chemopreventive effects between different types of non-herbal tea.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29579174,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of progression in radiographic adjacent-level degeneration (ΔALD) from preoperative assessment to 5 years after total disc replacement (TDR) and the relationship of these changes with range of motion and clinical adjacent-level disease. A secondary objective was to compare adjacent-level degeneration (ALD) outcomes between TDR and fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Fusion is associated with high rates of ALD in symptomatic lumbar disc degeneration. TDR may reduce this risk. METHODS: In total, 175 patients with single-level, symptomatic, lumbar disc degeneration who had received activL or ProDisc-L and had a preoperative and 5-year postoperative radiograph available were included. Over 5-year follow-up, ΔALD was defined as an increase in ALD of ≥1 grade and clinical ALD was defined as surgical treatment at the level adjacent to an index TDR. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were conducted to compare ALD outcomes after TDR (current trial) with those after fusion (published trial). RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, 9.7% (17/175) of TDR patients had ΔALD at the superior level. In patients with preoperative ALD at the superior level, most (88% [23/26]) showed no radiographic progression over 5 years. The rate of clinical ALD was 2.3% (4/175) and none of these patients had ALD at baseline. For each degree of range of motion gained at the TDR level, there was a consistent decrease in the percentage of patients with ΔALD. After matching and adjustment of baseline characteristics, TDR had a significantly lower likelihood of ΔALD than fusion (odds ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.13, 0.76). CONCLUSION: The rates of ΔALD and clinical ALD in this TDR population were similar to those previously reported in the literature for TDR at 5-year follow-up. TDR had a significantly lower rate of ΔALD than fusion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",29570121,PMC6203419

We also have derived the explicit formula of its 95% CIs by applying the delta method, and as an alternative, a simulation-based method. RESULTS: The method was applied in a case study example in radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC) patients, comparing lenvatinib to sorafenib. For every two RR-DTC patients treated with lenvatinib instead of sorafenib, one fewer would have progressed and for every eight RR-DTC patients treated with lenvatinib instead of sorafenib, one fewer would have died. CONCLUSION: Using NNT to summarize the results of a matching adjusted indirect comparison can help the clinicians to better understand the results in addition to OR.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",29537878,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of nivolumab monotherapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma patients in England. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and benefits of nivolumab versus ipilimumab and dacarbazine for BRAF mutation-negative patients and versus ipilimumab, dabrafenib, and vemurafenib for BRAF mutation-positive patients. Covariate-adjusted parametric curves for time to progression, pre-progression survival, and post-progression survival were fitted based on patient-level data from two trials and long-term ipilimumab survival data. Indirect treatment comparisons between nivolumab, ipilimumab, and dacarbazine were informed by these covariate-adjusted parametric curves, controlling for differences in patient characteristics. Kaplan-Meier data from the literature were digitised and used to fit progression-free and overall survival curves for dabrafenib and vemurafenib. Patient utilities and resource use data were based on trial data or the literature. Patients are assumed to receive nivolumab until there is no further clinical benefit, assumed to be the first of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or 2 years of treatment. RESULTS: Nivolumab is the most cost-effective treatment option in BRAF mutation-negative and mutation-positive patients, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £24,483 and £17,362 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. The model results are most sensitive to assumptions regarding treatment duration for nivolumab and the parameters of the fitted parametric survival curves.

One percent silver sulfadiazine has been utilized widely in the management of burns and newer silver dressings are on the market, including nanocrystalline silver dressings, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressings, and silver-impregnated foam dressings. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the cost effectiveness of the newer silver dressings using clinical data from an indirect treatment comparison using silver sulfadiazine as the baseline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed from a US payer's perspective for burn patients with a total body surface area of < 20%. Outcomes were length of stay, infections and incidence of surgical procedures, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost. RESULTS: The meta-analysis reported a statistically significant reduction in length of hospital stay and clinically important reductions in infections and incidence of surgical procedures in favor of the silver barrier dressing compared with other silver dressings. The estimated QALYs were 0.970 versus 0.969 versus 0.969 and mean cost per patient was $15,892, $23,799, and $24,269 for the nanocrystalline silver dressing, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, and silver-impregnated foam dressing, respectively. The analysis showed the nanocrystalline silver dressing to be a dominant strategy (less costly with better outcomes). These findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: According to data from an indirect treatment comparison, this analysis suggests that nanocrystalline silver dressing is the most cost-effective silver delivery system. Prospective head-to-head research on the costs and outcomes of these silver delivery systems in this patient population is necessary to validate the results of this economic evaluation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29521644,

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase from January 1, 2005 through April 1, 2017 for RCTs in AIS patients, comparing a single MET+IVtPA to IVtPA alone and reporting shift in ordinal modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days. Secondary endpoints included 90 day mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). Endpoints were pooled using traditional random effects meta-analysis methods, producing odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Adjusted ITCs using pooled estimates were then performed. Three studies (SWIFT PRIME, EXTEND-IA, THERAPY) were included; two evaluating the Solitaire stent retriever and one the Penumbra system. Traditional meta-analysis demonstrated that each MET+IVtPA resulted in increased odds of improving ordinal mRS score vs. IVtPA alone, but did not alter the odds of death or sICH. Adjusted ITC showed no significant difference between the METs for any outcome.

This paper focusses on the three phases of CML: the chronic phase (CP), the accelerated phase (AP) and the blast crisis phase (BP). The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents the critical review of the company's submission by the ERG and the outcome of the NICE guidance. Clinical evidence for ponatinib was derived from a phase II, industry-sponsored, single-arm, open-label, multicentre, non-comparative study. Despite the limited evidence and potential for biases, this study demonstrated that ponatinib was likely to be an effective treatment (in terms of major cytogenetic response and major haematological response) with an acceptable safety profile for patients with CML. Given the absence of any head-to-head studies comparing ponatinib with other relevant comparators, the company undertook a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of ponatinib with bosutinib. The approach was only used for patients with CP-CML because comprehensive data were not available for the AP- or BP-CML groups to allow the matching technique to be used. Despite the uncertainty about the MAIC approach, ponatinib was considered likely to offer advantages over bosutinib in the third-line setting, particularly for complete cytogenetic response. The company developed two health economic models to assess the cost effectiveness of ponatinib for the treatment of patients in CP-CML or in advanced CML (AP- or BP-CML, which were modelled separately). The company did not adequately explore the uncertainty in the survivor functions. As a result, the ERG believed the uncertainty in the decision problem was underestimated. Exploratory analyses undertaken by the ERG produced the following results for ponatinib. In CP-CML, from £18,246 to £27,667 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with best supportive care (BSC), from £19,680 to £37,381 per QALY gained compared with bosutinib and from £18,279 per QALY gained to dominated compared with allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). In AP-CML, the cost per QALY gained for ponatinib ranged from £7123 to £17,625 compared with BSC, and from dominating to £61,896 per QALY gained compared with allo-SCT. In BP-CML, the cost effectiveness of ponatinib ranged from £5033 per QALY gained to dominated compared with allo-SCT, although it was likely to be at the more favourable end of this range, and dominant in all scenarios compared with BSC. The NICE appraisal committee concluded that ponatinib is a cost-effective use of NHS resources in the considered population, subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the Patient Access Scheme.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_original_article | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Find the original article""]}",29480454,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (stable disease, progressive disease, death) was developed over a 20-year time horizon. Ceritinib's efficacy inputs (progression-free and overall survival) were estimated from ASCEND-4; parametric survival models extrapolated data beyond the trial period. The relative efficacy of ceritinib vs chemotherapy was obtained from ASCEND-4, the relative efficacy of ceritinib vs crizotinib was estimated using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison based on ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. Drug acquisition, treatment administration, adverse event management, and medical costs were obtained from publicly available databases and the literature, and inflated to 2016 US dollars. Treatment-specific stable-state utilities were derived from trials and progressive-state utility from the literature. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated for ceritinib vs each comparator. Cost-effectiveness was assessed based on US willingness-to-pay thresholds. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test model robustness. RESULTS: In the base case, first-line ceritinib was associated with total direct costs of $299,777 and 3.28 QALYs (from 4.61 life years gained [LYG]) over 20 years. First-line crizotinib and chemotherapy were associated with 2.73 and 2.41 QALYs, 3.92 and 3.53 LYG, and $263,172 and $228,184 total direct costs, respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained was $66,064 for ceritinib vs crizotinib and $81,645 for ceritinib vs chemotherapy. In the first 2 years following treatment initiation, ceritinib dominated crizotinib by conferring greater health benefits at reduced total costs. Results were robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. LIMITATIONS: In the absence of head-to-head trials, an indirect comparison method was used.

METHODS: The Swedish Institute for Health Economics cohort model for T2D was used to compare liraglutide and lixisenatide (both added to basal insulin), with a societal perspective and with comparative treatment effects derived by indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Drug prices were 2016 values, and all other costs 2015 values. The cost-effectiveness of IDegLira (fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide) versus lixisenatide plus basal insulin was also assessed, under different sets of assumptions. RESULTS: From the ITC, decreases in HbA1c were -1.32% and -0.43% with liraglutide and lixisenatide, respectively; decreases in BMI were -1.29 and -0.65 kg/m2, respectively. An estimated 2348 cases of retinopathy, 265 of neuropathy and 991 of nephropathy would be avoided with liraglutide compared with lixisenatide in a cohort of 10,000 patients aged over 40 years. In the base-case analysis, total direct costs were higher with liraglutide than lixisenatide, but costs associated with complications were lower. The cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for liraglutide added to basal insulin was SEK30,802. Base-case findings were robust in sensitivity analyses, except when glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) differences for liraglutide added to basal insulin were abolished, suggesting these benefits were driving the cost/QALY. With liraglutide 1.2 mg instead of liraglutide 1.8 mg (adjusted for efficacy and cost), liraglutide added to basal insulin was dominant over lixisenatide 20μg.IDegLira was dominant versus lixisenatide plus basal insulin when a defined daily dose was used in the model. CONCLUSIONS: The costs/QALY for liraglutide, 1.8 or 1.2 mg, added to basal insulin, and for IDegLira (all compared with lixisenatide 20 μg added to basal insulin) were below the threshold considered low by Swedish authorities.

With the recent development of new hyperkalaemia treatments, new information on safe and effective management of hyperkalaemia has emerged. OBJECTIVES: This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to identify all relevant comparative and non-comparative clinical data on management of hyperkalaemia in adults. Our secondary aim was to assess the feasibility of quantitatively comparing randomised controlled trial (RCT) data on the novel treatment sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS) and established pharmacological treatments for the non-emergency management of hyperkalaemia, such as the cation-exchangers sodium/calcium polystyrene sulphonate (SPS/CPS). METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched on 3(rd) April 2017, with additional hand-searches of key congresses and previous SLRs. Articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Eligible records reported interventional or observational studies of pharmacological or non-pharmacological management of hyperkalaemia in adults. RESULTS: Database searches identified 2,073 unique records. Two hundred and one publications were included, reporting 30 RCTs, 29 interventional non-RCTs and 43 observational studies. Interventions investigated in RCTs included ZS (3), SPS/CPS (3), patiromer (4) and combinations of temporising agents (6 RCTs). A robust and meaningful indirect treatment comparison between ZS and long-established cation-binding agents (SPS/CPS) was infeasible because of heterogeneity between studies (including time points and dosing) and small sample size in SPS/CPS studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite hyperkalaemia being associated with several chronic diseases, there is a paucity of high-quality randomised evidence on long-established treatment options (SPS and CPS) and a limited evidence base for hyperkalaemia management with these agents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,no_paitc",29381246,

We therefore conducted a systematic review of NMAs of pharmacological treatment for common mental disorders in order to assess the methodological quality of these NMAs, and to relate study characteristics to the rankings of efficacy and tolerability. STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: We searched three databases for NMAs of pharmacological treatment used in major depression, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and specific phobia.Studies were appraised using the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research checklist of good research practices for indirect-treatment-comparison and network-meta-analysis studies. FINDINGS: Twenty NMAs were eligible for inclusion. The number of randomised controlled trials per NMA ranged from 11 to 234, and included between 801 to more than 26 000 participants. Overall, antidepressants were found to be efficacious and tolerable agents for several disorders based on rankings (45%) or statistical significance (55%). The majority of NMAs in this review adhered to guidelines by including a network diagram (70%), assessing consistency (75%), making use of a random effects model (75%), providing information on the model used to fit the data (75%) and adjusting for covariates (75%). CONCLUSIONS: The 20 NMAs of depression and anxiety disorders, PTSD and/or OCD included in this review demonstrate some methodological strengths in comparison with the larger body of published NMAs for medical disorders, support current treatment guidelines and help inform clinical decision-making.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,no_paitc",29330217,

We performed an adjusted indirect comparison using placebo as a common control. The main outcomes were efficacy (response to treatment by Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale/Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) and acceptability (withdrawal rate for any reason or due to adverse events). 10 agomelatine and 11 vortioxetine studies were included in the analysis. For efficacy, no difference was shown between agomelatine and vortioxetine (E[95% CI] = -0.03 [-0.12;0.05]). For acceptability, no significant difference was found between both antidepressants. These findings substantiate current understanding that most antidepressants are of similar average efficacy and tolerability. Such equivalent therapeutic benefit of both compounds, measured by a quantitative clinical research approach, has to be discussed with the knowledge of a qualitative estimation in routine practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29327372,

METHODS: Study groups included patients randomized to adalimumab or placebo (REVEAL and CHAMPION trials) and those randomized to etanercept or placebo (M10-114 and M10-315 trials). Week 12 outcomes were compared between patients receiving adalimumab and those receiving etanercept after adjusting for cross-trial differences in patient characteristics using propensity score weighting and after subtracting effects of placebo. Outcomes included proportion of patients achieving 75% or more, 90% or more, and 100% reductions from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75, PASI90, PASI100, respectively), symptom resolution (pruritus = 0; psoriatic pain = 0), lesion resolution (minimal scores for plaque signs erythema, desquamation, and induration, and by body regions head, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs), absence of skin-related quality-of-life impact (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] = 0), ""complete disease control"" (patient's global assessment [PtGA] = 0), and adverse events. RESULTS: After adjustment, baseline characteristics were balanced among study groups (adalimumab = 875 vs. placebo = 427; etanercept = 260 vs. placebo = 130). Compared with etanercept, adalimumab was associated with significantly better placebo-adjusted outcomes (PASI75: 62.3% vs. 42.6%; PASI90: 35.9% vs. 12.1%; PASI100: 13.1% vs. 4.9%; pruritus: 24.7% vs. 13.0%; psoriatic pain: 27.4% vs. 8.7%; DLQI: 27.7% vs. 11.7%; and PtGA: 16.4% vs. 10.6%; all P < 0.05), except for similar rates of adverse events and head-specific lesion resolution.

A systematic review and indirect treatment comparison.,2018,,,Journal of pain research,1178-7090 (Print),11,,11-21,Porter KM and Siddiqui MK and Sharma I and Dickerson S and Eberhardt A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29302193/,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Low-dose methoxyflurane and nitrous oxide (N(2)O; 50:50 with oxygen) are both self-administered, self-titrated, rapid-acting, nonnarcotic, and noninvasive inhalational agents with similar onset times of pain relief. The aim of this review was to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these analgesics in emergency care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search and review according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines were performed using Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Library, several clinical trial registers, and emergency-medicine conference material. RESULTS: Although both compounds have been used for many years in emergency care, the search found only a few controlled studies and no head-to-head trials performed in this setting. Two double-blind, randomized studies comparing their respective study medication (low-dose methoxyflurane or N(2)O) to placebo were identified that could be compared in an indirect approach by using placebo as a bridging comparator. Both agents provided rapid pain relief to trauma patients, with no significant differences between them; both treatments were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Both low-dose methoxyflurane and N(2)O are suitable options for the pain treatment of trauma patients in the emergency setting. Due to the ease of administration and portability, inhaled low-dose methoxyflurane, however, may not only offer advantages in emergency situations in remote or difficult-to-reach locations and mass-casualty situations but also be of significant value in urban and rural environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29302193,PMC5741984

The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head to head, which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents (acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters, methotrexate), small molecules (apremilast, tofacitinib, ponesimod), anti-TNF alpha (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab), anti-IL12/23 (ustekinumab), anti-IL17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab), anti-IL23 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab), and other biologics (alefacept, itolizumab) for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases to December 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports. We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant RCTs. We searched the trial results databases of a number of pharmaceutical companies and handsearched the conference proceedings of a number of dermatology meetings. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic and biological treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed with moderate to severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to placebo or another active agent. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three groups of two review authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI) 90) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse effects). We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes, according to GRADE; we evaluated evidence as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. MAIN RESULTS: We included 109 studies in our review (39,882 randomised participants, 68% men, all recruited from a hospital). The overall average age was 44 years; the overall mean PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo controlled (67%), 23% were head-to-head studies, and 10% were multi-armed studies with both an active comparator and placebo. We have assessed all treatments listed in the objectives (19 in total). In all, 86 trials were multicentric trials (two to 231 centres). All of the trials included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment at less than 24 weeks after randomisation); in fact, all trials included in the network meta-analysis were measured between 12 and 16 weeks after randomisation. We assessed the majority of studies (48/109) as being at high risk of bias; 38 were assessed as at an unclear risk, and 23, low risk.Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90.In terms of reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents. Small molecules were associated with a higher chance of reaching PASI 90 compared to conventional systemic agents.At drug level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, all of the anti-IL17 agents and guselkumab (an anti-IL23 drug) were significantly more effective than the anti-TNF alpha agents infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, but not certolizumab. Ustekinumab was superior to etanercept. No clear difference was shown between infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept. Only one trial assessed the efficacy of infliximab in this network; thus, these results have to be interpreted with caution. Tofacitinib was significantly superior to methotrexate, and no clear difference was shown between any of the other small molecules versus conventional treatments.Network meta-analysis also showed that ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90: the most effective drug was ixekizumab (risk ratio (RR) 32.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.61 to 44.60; Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) = 94.3; high-certainty evidence), followed by secukinumab (RR 26.55, 95% CI 20.32 to 34.69; SUCRA = 86.5; high-certainty evidence), brodalumab (RR 25.45, 95% CI 18.74 to 34.57; SUCRA = 84.3; moderate-certainty evidence), guselkumab (RR 21.03, 95% CI 14.56 to 30.38; SUCRA = 77; moderate-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 24.58, 95% CI 3.46 to 174.73; SUCRA = 75.7; moderate-certainty evidence), and ustekinumab (RR 19.91, 95% CI 15.11 to 26.23; SUCRA = 72.6; high-certainty evidence).We found no significant difference between all of the interventions and the placebo regarding the risk of serious adverse effects (SAEs): the relative ranking strongly suggested that methotrexate was associated with the best safety profile regarding all of the SAEs (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99; SUCRA = 90.7; moderate-certainty evidence), followed by ciclosporin (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.10; SUCRA = 78.2; very low-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.36; SUCRA = 70.9; moderate-certainty evidence), infliximab (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.00; SUCRA = 64.4; very low-certainty evidence), alefacept (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.55; SUCRA = 62.6; low-certainty evidence), and fumaric acid esters (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.99; SUCRA = 57.7; very low-certainty evidence). Major adverse cardiac events, serious infections, or malignancies were reported in both the placebo and intervention groups. Nevertheless, the SAEs analyses were based on a very low number of events with low to very low certainty for just over half of the treatment estimates in total, moderate for the others. Thus, the results have to be considered with caution.Considering both efficacy (PASI 90 outcome) and acceptability (SAEs outcome), highly effective treatments also had more SAEs compared to the other treatments, and ustekinumab, infliximab, and certolizumab appeared to have the better trade-off between efficacy and acceptability.Regarding the other efficacy outcomes, PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1, the results were very similar to the results for PASI 90.Information on quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for a third of the interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab are the best choices for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate to severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence. At class level, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents, too. This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured between 12 to 16 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficiently relevant for a chronic disease. Moreover, low numbers of studies were found for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 44 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice.Another major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly reported safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. Indeed, we found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs. Methotrexate appeared to have the best safety profile, but as the evidence was of very low to moderate quality, we cannot be sure of the ranking. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the treatments included in this review, it will be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies as well.In terms of future research, randomised trials comparing directly active agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between conventional systemic and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve patients, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the interventions and the comparative safety of different agents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29271481,PMC6486272

Analysis of treatment effect from two separate trials had the potential to more accurately estimate the magnitude of OS benefit due to absence of confounding due to treatment switching from the control arm to the osimertinib arm of the ongoing randomized control trial, AURA3. METHODS: Two non-randomized individual datasets were compared: pooled patients from the AURA extension and AURA2 trials (osimertinib 80 mg, n = 405, with a confirmed T790M mutation using tissue samples), and patients from the control arm of the IMPRESS study (platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, n = 61, with a confirmed T790M mutation using plasma circulating tumour DNA [ctDNA]). A propensity score-based approach was used to account for differences in baseline demographics and disease characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline differences between the two groups, osimertinib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.278, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.188-0.409, p < 0.0001; median PFS 10.9 vs. 5.3 months). Improvements were also observed for objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) (ORR: 64.3 vs. 33.3%; odds ratio [OR] = 5.31, 95% CI 2.47-11.40, p < 0.001; DCR: 92.1 vs. 75.0%; OR = 4.72, 95% CI 1.92-11.58, p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained for patients who received osimertinib as second-line treatment only. A statistically significant improvement in OS was observed for the osimertinib group (HR = 0.412, 95% CI 0.273-0.622, p < 0.0001). Median OS for osimertinib was not reached. CONCLUSIONS: In this indirect comparison, osimertinib showed a statistically significant improvement in efficacy outcomes versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in patients with EGFRm T790M NSCLC who had progressed after EGFR-TKI therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29247383,PMC5856890

To provide a comprehensive indirect treatment comparison of efficacy and safety of novel drugs, a network meta-analysis (NMA) of phase III randomized controlled trials was performed. METHODS: After pertinent literature search up to November 1, 2016, 6 studies were eligible for the analysis including 4,812 individual patients with advanced HCC: 2,454 received sorafenib, 577 received brivanib, 530 received sunitinib, 514 received linifanib, 358 received sorafenib + erlotinib and 379 received placebo. Frequentist NMA was used to compare treatments within a single analytical framework. RESULTS: NMA showed that sorafenib alone, regardless of combination with erlotinib, and linifanib provide a significant survival advantage over placebo (p < 0.05) but without any significant difference between each other. Conversely, all regimens significantly ameliorate progression-free survival versus placebo (p < 0.05). The rank order of efficacy was: sorafenib ± erlotinib, linifanib, brivanib, sunitinib, and placebo. Sorafenib ± erlotinib was the regimen with the fewest number of adverse events that required discontinuation of treatment, whereas linifanib and brivanib resulted in the most adverse events. The risk-benefit summary identified one cluster of therapies with a similar balance between efficacy and safety which included sorafenib alone or in combination with erlotinib, having, at the same time, the highest efficacy and safety. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib remains the best systemic treatment for advanced HCC; linifanib also resulted in survival advantages over placebo but with a lower safety profile.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29234637,PMC5704710

Tofacitinib, an oral small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, is potentially a new treatment option. AIM: To comparatively assess efficacy and harm of tofacitinib and biologics (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and vedolizumab) in adult patients not previously exposed to TNF antagonists. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, clinical trial registries, regulatory authorities' websites and major conference proceedings, through August 2017, to identify randomised, placebo-controlled or head-to-head trials assessing tofacitinib or biologics as induction and/or maintenance therapy in moderate-to-severe UC. Two reviewers independently extracted study data and outcomes, and investigated each trial's risk-of-bias. We used conventional meta-analysis to synthesise direct evidence, and network meta-analysis for adjusted indirect treatment comparisons. RESULTS: Fifteen randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (n = 3130) contributed data for induction: All treatments are superior to placebo. Indirect treatment comparisons showed that infliximab is better than adalimumab (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.36-2.98) and golimumab (1.67, 1.08-2.59) in clinical response, better than adalimumab (2.10, 1.21-3.64) in clinical remission, and better than adalimumab (1.87, 1.26-2.79) and golimumab (1.75, 1.13-2.73) in mucosal healing. No indirect comparisons between tofacitinib and biologics reached statistical significance. Nine studies (n = 1776) contributed maintenance data showing that all treatments have higher clinical efficacy than placebo. Safety analyses indicated no increased rates of adverse events for the treatments under evaluation (except for infliximab), while vedolizumab may have an advantage regarding the occurrence of serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib and biologics are efficacious and safe for UC.

We conducted a meta-analysis to indirectly compare overall efficacy and tolerability between third-generation AEDs in uncontrolled focal epilepsy. METHODS: We performed an online database search using Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Online Library, and Clinicaltrial.gov for all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the therapeutic effects over a range of AED doses versus placebo. We then compared clinical efficacy and tolerability between these newer AEDs using Indirect Treatment Comparison software. RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs with a total of 7245 patients were included in our study. There were no significant differences in the risk difference of 50% responder rates and seizure free rates between third generation AEDs, regardless of dose. The risk of treatment emergent adverse events was significantly higher with ESL and PER treatment compared to BRV at all doses combined. Withdrawal rates due to adverse events were also significantly higher in patients treated with the highest doses of LAC and PER versus BRV, while treatment with ESL or LAC was related to higher withdrawal rates versus BRV when all doses were combined. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggested there were no significant differences in efficacy between third generation AEDs in uncontrolled focal epilepsy. BRV may have the best tolerability profile. The other AEDs were associated with a higher risk for intolerable adverse, especially when taken at a high doses. The results from these indirect comparisons warrant further examination and verification through future well-designed trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29197667,

Data from 148 patients receiving daratumumab (16 mg/kg), pooled from the GEN501 and SIRIUS studies, were compared separately with data from patients receiving pomalidomide + LoDex in the MM-003 and STRATUS studies. RESULTS: The MAIC-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for OS of daratumumab versus pomalidomide + LoDex was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.83; p = .0041) for MM-003 and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.37-0.69; p < .0001) for STRATUS. The treatment benefit was even more pronounced when the daratumumab population was restricted to pomalidomide-naïve patients (MM-003: HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.66; p = .0017; STRATUS: HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.79; p = .0082). An additional analysis indicated a consistent trend of the OS benefit across subgroups based on M-protein level reduction (≥50%, ≥25%, and <25%). CONCLUSION: The MAIC results suggest that daratumumab improves OS compared with pomalidomide + LoDex in patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This matching adjusted indirect comparison of clinical trial data from four studies analyzes the survival outcomes of patients with heavily pretreated, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who received either daratumumab monotherapy or pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone. Using this method, daratumumab conferred a significant overall survival benefit compared with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone. In the absence of head-to-head trials, these indirect comparisons provide useful insights to clinicians and reimbursement authorities around the relative efficacy of treatments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",29192016,PMC5905688

The aim of this Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) is to assess the relative efficacies of available open combinations (delivered via separate inhalers) and fixed-dose combinations (FDCs, delivered via a single inhaler). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review with the aim of identifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ≥8-week duration in adults aged ≥40 years with COPD that compared LAMA + LABA combinations with each other, with tiotropium (TIO), or with placebo. Data on changes from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score, and rescue medication use at 12 and 24 weeks were extracted from these RCTs and analyzed using a NMA in a Bayesian framework. RESULTS: Data from 44 RCTs were included in the NMA. All FDCs showed improvements relative to placebo in terms of trough FEV(1), SGRQ total score, and TDI focal score above clinically relevant thresholds, with the exception of TIO/olodaterol and aclidinium/formoterol, both of which failed to show clinically relevant improvements in SGRQ score at 24 weeks. All FDCs demonstrated reduced rescue medication use versus placebo. Open combinations demonstrated improved efficacy in all outcomes versus placebo, but these improvements did not consistently exceed clinically relevant thresholds for SGRQ and TDI scores. All once-daily FDCs showed improved efficacy versus TIO, but improvements were less consistently observed versus TIO with open dual combinations and combinations containing formoterol or salmeterol administered twice daily. Relative probabilities of improvement between FDCs highlighted potential between-class differences for trough FEV(1) but suggested little potential for differences in patient-reported outcomes. CONCLUSION: LAMA + LABA combinations generally showed improved outcomes versus placebo and TIO. FDCs appeared to perform better than open dual combinations. A potential effectiveness gradient was observed between FDCs for objectively assessed functional outcomes, although further prospective trials are required to confirm these findings.

The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents a summary of the company's evidence, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance (TA440), issued on 26 April 2017. Clinical evidence for liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus 5-FU/LV was derived from 236 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in the multinational, open-label, randomised controlled NAPOLI-1 trial. Results from analyses of progression-free survival and overall survival showed statistically significant improvements for patients treated with liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV compared with those treated with 5-FU/LV. However, 5-FU/LV alone is rarely used in National Health Service clinical practice for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with gemcitabine. The company, ERG and Appraisal Committee (AC) all agreed that oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV is the most commonly used treatment. Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV was compared with 5-FU/LV in two trials identified by the company. However, the company and the ERG both considered attempts to compare the efficacy of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV with oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV to be methodologically flawed; not only was there heterogeneity between trials and their populations but also the proportional hazards assumption required to conduct a robust indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was violated. Nonetheless, data derived from an ITC were used to inform the company's economic model. Using the discounted patient access scheme price for liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV, the company reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of £54,412 for the comparison with oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV. The ERG considered that the company's base-case cost-effectiveness results for the comparison of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV were underestimates and should be interpreted with extreme caution. Following implementation of a number of model amendments, the ERG's modified exploratory ICER for the comparison of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV was £106,898 per QALY gained. The AC accepted the majority of the ERG's amendments to the model, and also highlighted that the total QALYs for oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV were lower than for 5-FU/LV in the company's model, which the AC considered to be clinically implausible. The AC therefore considered results from exploratory analyses, undertaken by the ERG, which included altering the QALY difference between liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV by ± 10%. These analyses resulted in ICERs for the comparison of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV of between £201,019 per QALY gained to liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV being dominated by oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV. Therefore, despite uncertainty around the clinical-effectiveness evidence and cost-effectiveness results, the AC was confident that the ICER was in excess of £50,000 per QALY gained. The final guidance issued by NICE is that liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV is not recommended within its marketing authorisation for treating metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in adults whose disease has progressed after gemcitabine-based therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_original_article",29178025,

METHODS: Using longitudinal chart data from the Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies (RMG) of the Czech Myeloma Group, patient-level data from the RMG was pooled with pivotal daratumumab monotherapy studies (GEN501 and SIRIUS; 16 mg/kg). RESULTS: From the RMG database, we identified 972 treatment lines in 463 patients previously treated with both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug. Treatment initiation dates for RMG patients were between March 2006 and March 2015. The most frequently used treatment regimens were lenalidomide-based regimens (33.4%), chemotherapy (18.1%), bortezomib-based regimens (13.6%), thalidomide-based regimens (8.0%), and bortezomib plus thalidomide (5.3%). Few patients were treated with carfilzomib-based regimens (2.5%) and pomalidomide-based regimens (2.4%). Median observed PFS for daratumumab and the RMG cohort was 4.0 and 5.8 months (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-1.39), respectively, and unadjusted median OS was 20.1 and 11.9 months (unadjusted HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48-0.78), respectively. Statistical adjustments for differences in baseline characteristics were made using patient-level data. The adjusted HRs (95% CI) for PFS and OS for daratumumab versus the RMG cohort were 0.79 (0.56-1.12; p = .192) and 0.33 (0.21-0.52; p < .001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted comparisons between trial data and historical cohorts can provide useful insights to clinicians and reimbursement decision makers on relative treatment efficacies in the absence of head-to-head comparison studies for daratumumab monotherapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29172760,

OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy and quality of life using matching-adjusted indirect comparisons for treatment with ixekizumab vs. secukinumab. METHODS: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement of at least 75%, 90% and 100% and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 0/1 response rates for approved dosages of ixekizumab (160 mg at Week 0, then 80 mg every two weeks for the first 12 weeks) and secukinumab (300 mg at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, then 300 mg every 4 weeks) treatment were compared using data from active (etanercept and ustekinumab) and placebo-controlled studies. Comparisons were made using the Bucher (BU) method and two modified versions of the Signorovitch (SG) method (SG total and SG separate). Subsequently, results based on active treatment common comparators were combined using generic inverse-variance meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the meta-analysis of studies with active comparators, PASI 90 response rates were 12·7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5·5-19·8, P = 0·0005], 10·0% (95% CI 2·1-18·0, P = 0·01) and 11·2% (95% CI 3·2-19·1, P = 0·006) higher and PASI 100 response rates were 11·7% (95% CI 5·9-17·5, P < 0·001), 12·7% (95% CI 6·0-19·4, P < 0·001) and 13·1% (95% CI 6·3-19·9, P < 0·001) higher for ixekizumab compared with secukinumab using BU, SG total and SG separate methods. PASI 75 results were comparable when SG methods were used and favoured ixekizumab when the BU method was used. Week 12 DLQI 0/1 response rates did not differ significantly.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from phase 3 trials providing evidence for estimating the relative efficacy and safety of IDegLira vs iGlarLixi in patients uncontrolled on basal insulin-only regimens were used in this analysis. Outcomes of interest were changes in HbA(1c), body weight and insulin dose, and rate ratio of hypoglycemia. The indirect comparison of the reported trial findings followed the principles of Bucher et al. RESULTS: IDegLira was estimated to provide a 0.44 [95% CI = 0.17-0.71] %-point reduction in HbA(1c) compared with iGlarLixi. Body weight was reduced by 1.42 [95% CI = 0.35-2.50] kg with IDegLira compared with iGlarLixi. Insulin dose was comparable between the two interventions. The rate of severe or blood glucose-confirmed (self-measured plasma glucose [SMPG] ≤ 3.1 mmol/L) hypoglycemia with IDegLira was approximately half that of iGlarLixi (rate ratio = 0.51 [95% CI = 0.29-0.90]). However, using the American Diabetes Association definition of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (SMPG ≤3.9 mmol/L) the rate was comparable between the two treatments (rate ratio = 1.07 [95% CI = 0.90-1.28]). LIMITATIONS: The assumptions made in the indirect comparison and differences between the included trials in baseline HbA(1c) levels, previous use of sulfonylureas, definitions of hypoglycemia, presence or absence of run-in period, the different duration of the trials, and the cross-over design of one of the trials. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this indirect treatment comparison demonstrate that, among patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, treatment with IDegLira results in a greater reduction of HbA(1c) and a greater reduction in body weight compared with iGlarLixi at similar insulin doses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",29164973,

The need for frequent injections with existing rFVIII products may, however, result in poor adherence to prophylaxis, leading to increased bleeding and long-term joint damage. Recombinant FVIIIFc (rFVIIIFc) is an extended half-life fusion protein which can offer prolonged protection and reduced dosing frequency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc in severe hemophilia A from the perspective of the Swedish health system. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate lifetime costs and benefits of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc vs rFVIII products. Clinical outcomes were represented by annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and quality of life via disutility applied to bleeding events and injection frequency. Costs included the cost of FVIII for routine prophylaxis and bleed resolution. The pooled comparator was costed by weighting the cost of individual products by their market share. RESULTS: In the base case, rFVIIIFc was dominant vs the pooled comparator. Savings of SEK 9.0 million per patient resulted from lower factor consumption for prophylaxis and bleed resolution. Fewer bleeds and reduced injection frequency yielded an estimated 0.59 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were sensitive to drug dosage and robust to variation in other parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a greater than 85% probability of rFVIIIFc being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 500,000 SEK/QALY. LIMITATIONS: Due to unavailibilty of patient-level data, treatment benefit was based on a non-adjusted indirect comparison. Dosing and treatment outcomes were assumed to persist over the model duration in the absence of long-term outcome data. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that rFVIIIFc may be a cost-effective option for hemophilia A prophylaxis, generating greater quality of life and reduced costs for the Swedish payer compared to more frequently administered rFVIII alternatives.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29139314,

A recent Cochrane systematic review demonstrated that intramuscular interferon beta 1a (IFN-β-1a-IM) was inferior to the other beta interferons (IFN-βs) for multiple sclerosis (MS). As a result, CONITEC commissioned an analysis to review possible disinvestment within SUS. The objective of this paper is to describe the disinvestment process for IFN-β-1a-IM in Brazil. The first assessment comprised a literature review and mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. The outcome of interest was the proportion of relapse-free patients in 2 years. This analysis confirmed the inferiority of IFN-β-1a-IM. Following this, CONITEC recommended disinvestment, with the decision sent for public consultation. More than 3000 contributions were made on CONITEC's webpage, most of them against the preliminary decision. As a result, CONITEC commissioned a study to assess the effectiveness of IFN-β-1a-IM among Brazilian patients in routine clinical care. The second assessment involved an 11-year follow-up of a non-concurrent cohort of 12,154 MS patients developed by deterministic-probabilistic linkage of SUS administrative databases. The real-world assessment further demonstrated that IFN-β-1a-IM users had a statistically higher risk of treatment failure, defined as treatment switching or relapse treatment or death, with the assessment showing that IFN-β-1a-IM was inferior to the other IFN-βs and to glatiramer acetate in both direct and indirect analysis. In the drug ranking with 40,000 simulations, IFN-β-1a-IM was the worst option, with a success rate of only 152/40,000. Following this, CONITEC decided to exclude the intramuscular presentation of IFN-β from the current MS treatment guidelines, giving patients who are currently on this treatment the option of continuing until treatment failure. In conclusion, we believe this is the first example of this new disinvestment process in action, providing an exemplar for other treatments in Brazil as well as other countries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",29139001,PMC5805817

Alternatively, network meta-analysis (NMA) is one method of analyzing multiple indirect treatment comparisons. However, NMA does not account for mixed end points or temporality. Previously, we described a prototype information theoretical approach for the construction of ranked chemotherapy treatment regimen networks. Here, we propose modifications to overcome an apparent straw man effect, where the most studied regimens were the most negatively valued. METHODS: RCTs from two scenarios-upfront treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma-were assembled into ranked networks using an automated algorithm based on effect sizes, statistical significance, surrogacy of end points, and time since RCT publication. Vertex and edge color, transparency, and size were used to visually analyze the network. This analysis led to the additional incorporation of value propagation. RESULTS: A total of 18 regimens with 42 connections (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and 28 regimens with 25 connections (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma) were analyzed. An initial negative correlation between vertex value and size was ameliorated after value propagation, although not eliminated. Updated rankings were in close agreement with published guidelines and NMAs. CONCLUSION: Straw man effects can distort the comparative efficacy of newer regimens at the expense of older regimens, which are often cheaper or less toxic. Using an automated method, we ameliorated this effect and produced rankings consistent with common practice and published guidelines in two distinct cancer settings. These findings are likely to be generalizable and suggest a new means of ranking efficacy in cancer trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic,methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Talk about an alternative way to measure efficacy in NMA, probably interesting to read""]}",30657401,PMC6874021

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR) and Erasmus University Rotterdam were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this submission. The ERG reviewed the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model, and conducted exploratory analyses in order to assess the robustness and validity of the presented clinical and cost-effectiveness results. This paper describes the company submission, the ERG assessment, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The company conducted a systematic review to identify studies comparing POM with comparators outlined in the NICE scope: panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone (PANO + BOR + DEX), bendamustine with thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD) and conventional chemotherapy (CC). The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from MM-003, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing POM + LoDEX with high-dose dexamethasone (HiDEX; used as a proxy for CC). Additional data from other studies were also used as nonrandomized observational data sources for the indirect treatment comparison of POM + LoDEX with BTD and PANO + BOR + DEX. Covariate or treatment switching adjustment methods were used for each comparison. The model developed in Microsoft(®) Excel 2010 using a semi-Markov partitioned survival structure, submitted in the original submission to NICE for TA338, was adapted for the present assessment of the cost effectiveness of POM + LoDEX. Updated evidence from the clinical-effectiveness part was used for the survival modelling of progression-free survival and overall survival. For POM + LoDEX, the patient access scheme (PAS) discount was applied to the POM price. Three separate comparisons were conducted for each comparator, each comparison using a different dataset and adjustment methods. The ERG identified and corrected some errors, and the corrected incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for POM + LoDEX versus each comparator were presented: approximately £45,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus BTD, savings of approximately £143,000 per QALY lost versus PANO + BOR + DEX, and approximately £49,000 per QALY gained versus CC. The ERG also conducted full incremental analyses, which revealed that CC, POM + LoDEX and PANO + BOR + DEX were on the cost-effectiveness frontier.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been evaluated relative to enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis though head-to-head comparisons of these agents are lacking. Therefore, we conducted a mixed treatment comparisons meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of established treatments and DOACs for VTE prophylaxis in medically-ill patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify randomized trials evaluating UFH, LMWHs or DOACS for the prevention of VTE in medically ill patients. Articles were retrieved and cross-referenced for additional trials, evaluated and entered into ADDIS (version 1.16.6) to generate direct and indirect treatment comparisons for VTE, DVT, PE, death from any cause, and bleeding. Ten articles were included and eight anticoagulants were evaluated in a treatment network representing data on 28,382 patients. We found each treatment had similar efficacy in preventing VTE, DVT, PE, death from any cause and each had similar risk of minor and major bleeding. Overall, placebo was associated with more VTE and DVT events compared to LMWHs and DOACs. We found that UFH, LMWHs and DOACs are comparable in preventing VTE, DVT, PE, and death from any cause and in association with minor and major bleeding. Anticoagulant selection for VTE prophylaxis in medically-ill patients should be individualized by patient characteristics, risks and preferences along with specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29043538,

OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, indirectly evaluating overall survival (OS) for men treated with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone with ADT (Abi-ADT) versus docetaxel with ADT (Doce-ADT) in hormone-naïve high-risk and metastatic PCa. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched in August 2017. We pooled results using the inverse variance technique and random-effects models. The Bucher technique for indirect treatment comparison was used to compare Abi-ADT with Doce-ADT. A priori subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall, 6067 patients from five trials were included: 1181 (19.5%) patients who received Doce-ADT, 1557 (25.7%) patients who received Abi-ADT, and 3329 (54.9%) patients who received ADT-alone. There was a total of 1921 deaths: 391 in the Doce-ADT group, 353 in the Abi-ADT group, and 1177 in the ADT-only group. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63-0.91, I(2)=51%, 3 trials, 2951 patients) for Doce-ADT versus ADT-alone and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.55-0.72, I(2)=0%, 2 trials, 3116 patients) for Abi-ADT versus ADT-alone. The indirect comparison of Abi-ADT to Doce-ADT demonstrated no statistically significant difference in OS between these approaches (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.67-1.06). Findings were similar in various a priori subset analyses, including patients with metastatic disease. Bayesian analyses demonstrated comparable results (HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.63-1.16). Despite the lack of statistical significance, Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Analysis demonstrated an 89% probability that Abi-ADT was preferred. CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify a significant difference in OS between Abi-ADT and Doce-ADT for men with hormone-naïve high-risk or metastatic PCa, although Bayesian analysis demonstrates a high likelihood that Abi-ADT was preferred. PATIENT SUMMARY: We synthesized the evidence available from studies examining the administration of docetaxel or abiraterone in combination with hormonal therapy for patients with newly diagnosed, advanced prostate cancer. While these studies did not directly compare these agents, we used methodological techniques to indirectly compare them and found no significant difference in overall survival.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",29037513,

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of POM-d, DARA, and CAR in this patient population from a US payer's perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to estimate the cost and health outcomes over a 3-year time horizon in 3 health states: progression-free, post-progression, and death. The main efficacy data source was a matching-adjusted indirect comparison using data from the aforementioned studies. Direct medical costs were considered, including: treatment acquisition and administration (initial line and subsequent line), pre- and post-medication, prophylaxis treatment, adverse event management, and health care resource utilization. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. A scenario analysis that assumed equal efficacy across all 3 treatments was conducted. Costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated and discounted at 3% per annum. FINDINGS: Over 3 years, the use of POM-d was associated with similar life-years and quality-adjusted life-years gained compared with DARA and CAR (incremental: life-years, +0.02 and +0.07, respectively; quality-adjusted life-years, +0.01 and +0.05), and with a cost less than that of DARA (-$8,919) and similar to that of CAR (-$195). Sensitivity analyses illustrated that the results were sensitive to progression-free survival, treatment duration, and drug costs. An equal efficacy scenario resulted in cost-savings relative to those of both DARA and CAR (-$11,779 and -$12,595). IMPLICATIONS: POM-d may be a cost-effective treatment option relative to DARA or CAR in heavily pretreated patients with RRMM in the US.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""checking that they are indeed conducting their own MAIC and not reusing something else""]}",28967482,

Late adverse effects include secondary malignancies which often have a poor prognosis. To synthesise evidence on the risk of secondary malignancies after current treatment approaches comprising chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, we performed a meta-analysis based on individual patient data (IPD) from patients treated for newly diagnosed HL. OBJECTIVES: We investigated several questions concerning possible changes in the risk of secondary malignancies when modifying chemotherapy or radiotherapy (omission of radiotherapy, reduction of the radiation field, reduction of the radiation dose, use of fewer chemotherapy cycles, intensification of chemotherapy). We also analysed whether these modifications affect progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL trials databases comprehensively in June 2010 for all randomised trials in HL since 1984. Key international trials registries were also searched. The search was updated in March 2015 without collecting further IPD (one further eligible study found) and again in July 2017 (no further eligible studies). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for untreated HL patients which enrolled at least 50 patients per arm, completed recruitment by 2007 and performed a treatment comparison relevant to our objectives. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study groups submitted IPD, including age, sex, stage and the outcomes secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN), OS and PFS as time-to-event data. We meta-analysed these data using Petos method (SMN) and Cox regression with inverse-variance pooling (OS, PFS) for each of the five study questions, and performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the applicability and robustness of the results. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 21 eligible trials and obtained IPD for 16. For four studies no data were supplied despite repeated efforts, while one study was only identified in 2015 and IPD were not sought. For each study question, between three and six trials with between 1101 and 2996 participants in total and median follow-up between 6.7 and 10.8 years were analysed. All participants were adults and mainly under 60 years. Risk of bias was assessed as low for the majority of studies and outcomes. Chemotherapy alone versus same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. Omitting additional radiotherapy probably reduces secondary malignancy incidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.82, low quality of evidence), corresponding to an estimated reduction of eight-year SMN risk from 8% to 4%. This decrease was particularly true for secondary acute leukemias. However, we had insufficient evidence to determine whether OS rates differ between patients treated with chemotherapy alone versus combined-modality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.11, moderate quality of evidence). There was a slightly higher rate of PFS with combined modality, but our confidence in the results was limited by high levels of statistical heterogeneity between studies (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.73, moderate quality of evidence). Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus extended-field radiation (early stages) . There is insufficient evidence to determine whether smaller radiation field reduces SMN risk (Peto OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.89, 95% C: 0.70 to 1.12, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21, high quality of evidence). Chemotherapy plus lower-dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus higher-dose radiation (early stages). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lower-radiation dose on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.48, high quality of evidence). Fewer versus more courses of chemotherapy (each with or without radiotherapy; early stages). Fewer chemotherapy courses probably has little or no effect on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62), OS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to1.34) or PFS (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.45).Outcomes had a moderate (SMN) or high (OS, PFS) quality of evidence. Dose-intensified versus ABVD-like chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy in each case). In the mainly advanced-stage patients who were treated with intensified chemotherapy, the rate of secondary malignancies was low. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of chemotherapy intensification (Peto OR 1.37, CI 0.89 to 2.10, low quality of evidence). The rate of secondary acute leukemias (and for younger patients, all secondary malignancies) was probably higher than among those who had treatment with standard-dose ABVD-like protocols. In contrast, the intensified chemotherapy protocols probably improved PFS (eight-year PFS 75% versus 69% for ABVD-like treatment, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified chemotherapy was not conclusive (HR: 0.85, CI 0.70 to 1.04), although escalated-dose BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival compared to ABVD-like chemotherapy (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, moderate quality of evidence).Generally, we could draw valid conclusions only in terms of secondary haematological malignancies, which usually occur less than 10 years after initial treatment, while follow-up within the present analysis was too short to record all solid tumours. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) is increased but efficacy is improved among patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols. Treatment decisions must be tailored for individual patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define which patients can safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced-dose radiotherapy did not appear to markedly affect efficacy or secondary malignancy risk. Due to the limited amount of long-term follow-up in this meta-analysis, further long-term investigations of late events are needed, particularly with respect to secondary solid tumours. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28901021,PMC6483617

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, and death) from a UK payer perspective and over lifetime (15 years) was developed. Direct costs included disease management, treatment-related (acquisition, administration, monitoring, adverse events), and T790M testing costs. Efficacy and safety data were taken from clinical trials AURA extension and AURA2 for osimertinib and IMPRESS for PDC. An adjusted indirect treatment comparison was applied to reduce the potential bias in the non-randomized comparison. Parametric functions were utilized to extrapolate survival beyond the observed period. Health state utility values were calculated from EQ-5D data collected in the trials and valued using UK tariffs. Resource use and costs were based on published sources. RESULTS: Osimertinib was associated with a gain of 1.541 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of £64,283 vs PDC (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: £41,705/QALY gained). Scenario analyses showed that none of the plausible scenarios produced an ICER above £44,000 per QALY gained, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated a 63.4% probability that osimertinib will be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £50,000. LIMITATIONS: The analysis is subject to some level of uncertainty inherent to phase 2 single-arm data and the immaturity of the currently available survival data for osimertinib. CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib may be considered a cost-effective treatment option compared with PDC in the second-line setting in patients with EGFR-T790M mutation-positive NSCLC from a UK payer perspective. Further data from the ongoing AURA clinical trial program will reduce the inherent uncertainty in the analysis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28880737,

To assess value for money, their cost effectiveness in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective was investigated. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using efficacy, symptomatic skeletal-related event and safety data obtained from indirect treatment comparisons. Missing skeletal-related event data for cabazitaxel were conservatively assumed to be identical to radium-223. A Markov model combined these clinical inputs with Dutch-specific resource use and costs for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment from a societal perspective. Total quality-adjusted life-years and costs in 2017 euros were calculated over a 5-year (lifetime) time horizon. RESULTS: Radium-223 resulted in €6092 and €4465 lower costs and 0.02 and 0.01 higher quality-adjusted life-years compared with abiraterone and cabazitaxel, respectively, demonstrating dominance of radium-223. Sensitivity analyses reveal a 64% (54%) chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with abiraterone (cabazitaxel) at the informal €80,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Compared with enzalutamide, radium-223 resulted in slightly lower quality-adjusted life-years (-0.06) and €7390 lower costs, revealing a 61% chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with enzalutamide. The lower costs of radium-223 compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide are driven by lower drug costs and prevention of expensive skeletal-related events. Compared with cabazitaxel, the lower costs of radium-223 are driven by lower costs of the drug, administration and adverse events. CONCLUSION: Radium-223 may be a less costly treatment strategy offering similar gains in health benefits compared with abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",28866822,PMC5797195

There is insufficient evidence on the most effective management of the appendix stump. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative effectiveness and provide a treatment ranking of different options for securing the appendix stump. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials comparing ligation methods of the appendix. The primary outcomes were organ/space infection and superficial operative site infection. We performed a network meta-analysis and estimated the pairwise relative treatment effects of the competing interventions using the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. We obtained a hierarchy of the competing interventions using rankograms and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. RESULTS: Forty-three randomized controlled trials were eligible and provided data for >5,000 patients. Suture ligation seemed to be the most effective treatment strategy, in terms of both organ/space infection and superficial operative site infection. Statistical significance was reached for the comparisons of clip versus endoloop (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.96) for organ/space infection; and suture versus clip (odds ratio 0.20, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.55) and clip versus endoloop (odds ratio 2.22, 95% confidence interval 1.56-3.13) for superficial operative site infection. The network was informed primarily by indirect treatment comparisons. CONCLUSION: The use of suture ligation of the appendix in laparoscopic appendectomy seems to be superior to other methods for the composite parameters of organ/space and superficial operative site infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28864100,

To attempt to account for heterogeneity among trials, propensity-score weighted patient-level data were used to indirectly compare placebo responses reported in brivaracetam and levetiracetam trials. METHODS: Patient-level data from randomised, placebo-controlled brivaracetam (recruited 2007-2014) and levetiracetam (1993-1998) trials were pooled. Consistent inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied and outcomes were defined consistently. Potentially confounding baseline characteristics were adjusted for using propensity score weighting. Weighting success was assessed using placebo response. RESULTS: In total, 707 and 473 active drug and 399 and 253 placebo patients comprised the brivaracetam and levetiracetam groups, respectively. Before weighting, several baseline variables were significantly different between groups; after weighting, prior vagal nerve stimulation, co-morbid depression and co-morbid anxiety remained different. Before weighting, median seizure frequency reduction was 21.7 and 3.9% in the brivaracetam and levetiracetam placebo arms, respectively; after weighting, median reduction was 15.0 and 6.0%. The comparison of non-randomised groups could be biased by unobserved confounding factors and region of residence. Lifetime AED history was unavailable in the brivaracetam trials and excluded from analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Placebo responses remained different between brivaracetam and levetiracetam trials after propensity score weighting, indicating the presence of residual confounding factors associated with placebo response in these trials. It therefore remains problematic to conduct reliable indirect comparisons of brivaracetam and levetiracetam given the current evidence base, which may apply to comparisons between other AED trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Probably interesting to include in the discussion or in references""]}",28856580,PMC5658476

Our aim was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of newer AEDs with Levetiracetam (LEV), when used as add-on treatments for uncontrolled focal epilepsy. METHOD: We conducted an online database search on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Online Library and Clinicaltrials.gov for all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the therapeutic effects of newer AEDs or LEV vs placebo. Indirect comparisons for clinical efficacy and tolerability at different doses between the newer AEDs and LEV were then performed using Indirect Treatment Comparison (ITC) software. RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs with a total of 8540 patients were included. Compared to LEV, ESL, LAC and BRV did not showed significant difference in efficacy at all dose level. PER showed lower 50% response rates and seizure-free rates at the highest effective recommended dosages. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and withdrawal rates due to adverse events (AEs) of LAC and PER were higher than LEV at the highest effective recommended dosages, and overall AE rates from ESL were higher than LEV. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons suggested that ESL, LAC and BRV were not inferior to LEV in efficacy. ESL, LAC and PER may have a possible worse tolerability profile compared to LEV at high dose. But BRV may exhibit a similar tolerability to LEV. Newer AEDs cannot exceed the LEV on efficacy and tolerability.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28854405,

These methods use individual patient data from a subset of trials to form population-adjusted indirect comparisons between treatments, in a specific target population. Recently proposed population adjustment methods include the Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) and the Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC). Despite increasing popularity, MAIC and STC remain largely untested. Furthermore, there is a lack of clarity about exactly how and when they should be applied in practice, and even whether the results are relevant to the decision problem. There is therefore a real and present risk that the assumptions being made in one submission to a reimbursement agency are fundamentally different to-or even incompatible with-the assumptions being made in another for the same indication. We describe the assumptions required for population-adjusted indirect comparisons, and demonstrate how these may be used to generate comparisons in any given target population. We distinguish between anchored and unanchored comparisons according to whether a common comparator arm is used or not. Unanchored comparisons make much stronger assumptions, which are widely regarded as infeasible. We provide recommendations on how and when population adjustment methods should be used, and the supporting analyses that are required to provide statistically valid, clinically meaningful, transparent and consistent results for the purposes of health technology appraisal. Simulation studies are needed to examine the properties of population adjustment methods and their robustness to breakdown of assumptions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",28823204,PMC5774635

In the absence of head-to-head trials, this study compared the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of adalimumab 40 mg versus secukinumab 150 and 300 mg for the treatment of active PsA. METHODS: A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was conducted using individual patient data from the ADEPT trial of adalimumab and published data from FUTURE I and II. To adjust for the cross-trial differences, individual patients in ADEPT were re-weighted so that the mean baseline characteristics (including age, weight, gender, race, baseline methotrexate use, psoriasis ≥3% body surface area, baseline PASI score, presence of dactylitis and enthesitis, and HAQ-DI) matched those in the FUTURE trials. Response rates relative to placebo and incremental costs per responder (CPR) over 24 weeks for ACR 20/50/70 and PASI 75/90 were compared between adalimumab and secukinumab 150 and 300 mg from the German social health insurance (SHI) perspective. RESULTS: After matching, mean baseline characteristics were balanced across the ADEPT and the FUTURE I and II populations. The mean differences between adalimumab and secukinumab 150 mg in relative ACR 20/50/70 and PASI 75/90 response rates were 9.5, 3.0, 6.0, 13.1, and 6.7%, respectively (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Post-match relative ACR 20/50/70 and PASI 75 to placebo were also higher with adalimumab compared to secukinumab 300 mg. Adalimumab had lower incremental costs per responder over 24 weeks for all outcomes compared with secukinumab 150 and 300 mg. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of direct comparisons between adalimumab and secukinumab, this study provides valuable and reliable evidence for physicians and payers. After adjusting for cross-trial differences in baseline characteristics, adalimumab was associated with higher relative ACR and PASI rates and lower incremental CPRs compared with secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg at week 24 among patients with active PsA.

We sought to compare the efficacy of commonly used silver delivery approaches including nanocrystalline silver, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, and silver-impregnated foam dressing as the main products in the management of partial thickness burns. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and other databases to identify relevant randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Due to the paucity of direct head-to-head trials, an indirect treatment comparison was performed. The use of nanocrystalline silver was associated with a statistically significant reduction in length of stay when compared to silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing (p = 0.027) and a shorter time to healing when compared to silver-impregnated foam dressing (p = 0.0328). There were no statistically significant differences in infection rates and surgical procedures between nanocrystalline silver, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, and silver-impregnated foam dressing; however, nanocrystalline silver was found to be the most beneficial for all the outcomes, including infection rates and surgical procedures, according to the Monte Carlo simulation method. In conclusion, current evidence from the published literature suggests that where the clinical and microbiological priority is to get in control of infection quickly it would seem prudent to use the most potent silver delivery system, which is nanocrystalline silver. Nanocrystalline silver may offer both clinical and economic benefits compared to alternative treatments in the management of patients with mixed burns that are at high risk of infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28742235,

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 is associated with faster disease progression and has fewer treatment options, historically, than other HCV genotypes. This analysis aims to estimate the comparative cost-effectiveness of two recently licenced interferon-free regimens for the treatment of HCV genotype 3. METHODS: Utilising a published Markov model and results of a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of recently published clinical trial data (ALLY-3 and VALENCE, respectively), 12 weeks of treatment with daclatasvir + sofosbuvir (DCV + SOF) was compared to 24 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir + ribavirin (SOF + RBV). UK-specific model inputs were used to inform a cost-utility analysis of these regimens. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, DCV + SOF was found to be dominant over SOF + RBV in treatment-naïve patients, patients that had previously been treated, and patients that are intolerant to, or ineligible for, interferon-containing regimens. Given the low rates of treatment currently observed in the UK, DCV + SOF was also compared to no treatment in the interferon-ineligible/intolerant patients, and may be considered cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £8817. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to 24 weeks of SOF + RBV, 12 weeks of treatment with DCV + SOF results in improved quality of life and reduced total costs, and therefore is likely to represent significant clinical and economic value as a treatment option for genotype 3 HCV infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc",28736505,PMC5521139

In such cases, a network meta-analysis model including treatment by covariate interactions can estimate the relative effects of all treatment pairings for each subgroup of patients. Two key assumptions underlie such models: consistency of treatment effects and consistency of the regression coefficients for the interactions. Consistency may differ depending on the covariate value at which consistency is assessed. For valid inference, we need to be confident of consistency for the relevant range of covariate values. In this paper, we demonstrate how to assess consistency of treatment effects from direct and indirect evidence at various covariate values. METHODS: Consistency is assessed using visual inspection, inconsistency estimates, and probabilities. The method is applied to an individual patient dataset comparing artemisinin combination therapies for treating uncomplicated malaria in children using the covariate age. RESULTS: The magnitude of the inconsistency appears to be decreasing with increasing age for each comparison. For one comparison, direct and indirect evidence differ for age 1 (P = .05), and this brings results for age 1 for all comparisons into question. CONCLUSION: When fitting models including interactions, the consistency of direct and indirect evidence must be assessed across the range of covariates included in the trials. Clinical inferences are only valid for covariate values for which results are consistent.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",28732142,PMC5724666

There are no direct-comparison studies with paliperidone palmitate (PP; long-acting antipsychotic used most often in acute settings) for the acute psychotic episode. OBJECTIVES: To indirectly compare efficacy and safety of the pivotal AL study with all PP studies meeting indirect comparison criteria. METHODS: Systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and gray literature were performed to identify randomized controlled trials of PP with similar designs to the AL trial. Bayesian network meta-analysis compared treatments with respect to symptom response and tolerability issues including weight gain, akathisia, parkinsonism, and likelihood of treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Three appropriate PP studies were identified for indirect comparison. Both doses of AL (441 mg and 882 mg monthly) were used and compared with two efficacious doses of PP (156 mg and 234 mg monthly). All four active-treatment conditions were associated with comparable reductions in acute symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) versus placebo and were of similar magnitude (range of mean difference -8.12 to -12.01, with overlapping 95% credible intervals). Between-group comparisons of active-treatment arms were associated with summary estimates of magnitude near 0. No clinically meaningful differences in selected safety or tolerability parameter incidence were found between active treatments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that both AL and PP are effective for treatment of adults experiencing acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28712616,

We conducted an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) to appraise comparative effectiveness of BT and OM. METHODS: A systematic literature review identified relevant randomized controlled trials. The ITC followed accepted methodology. RESULTS: The ITC comprised a sham-controlled trial of BT (AIR2) and two placebo-controlled trials of OM (INNOVATE; EXTRA). Comparing the BT post-treatment period to ongoing treatment with OM, showed no significant differences in the rate ratios (RRs) for severe exacerbations (RR of BT versus OM = 0.91 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.30]; p = 0.62) or hospitalizations (RR = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.17, 1.86]; p = 0.53); emergency department visits were significantly reduced by 75% with BT (RR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.91]; p = 0.04); the proportions of patients with clinically meaningful response on the asthma quality-of-life questionnaire were comparable (RR = 1.06 [95% CI: 0.86, 1.34]; p = 0.59). The RR for exacerbations statistically favours OM over the total study period in AIR2 (RR = 1.50 [95% CI: 1.11, 2.02]; p = 0.009) likely reflecting a transient increase in events during the BT peri-treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The ITC should be interpreted cautiously considering the differences between patient populations in the included trials. However, based on the analysis, BT compares well with a potentially more costly pharmacotherapy for asthma. Clinicians evaluating the relative merits of using these treatments should consider the totality of evidence and patient preferences to make an informed decision.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28708944,

There is currently no recommended therapy for second-line AGC in the UK despite the availability of various interventions. This paper aims to compare different interventions for treatment of second-line AGC using more complex methods to estimate relative efficacy, fitting various parametric models and to compare results to those published adopting conventional methods of synthesis. METHODS: Seven studies were identified in an existing literature review evaluating seven comparators, which formed a connected network of evidence. Citations were limited to randomised controlled trials in previously-treated AGC patients. Evidence quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Studies were assessed for the availability of Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival. Individual patient data (IPD) were recreated using digitisation software along with a published algorithm in R. The data were analysed using multi-dimensional network meta-analysis (NMA) methods. A series of parametric models were fitted to the pseudo-IPD. Both fixed and random-effects models were fitted to explore long-term survival prospects based on extrapolation methods and estimated mean survival. RESULTS: Relative efficacy estimates were compared to those previously reported, which utilised conventional NMA methods. Results presented were consistent within findings from other publications and identified ramucirumab plus paclitaxel as the best treatment; however, all the treatments assessed were associated with poor survival prospects with mean survival estimates ranging from 5.0 to 12.7 months. CONCLUSION: Whilst the approach adopted in this paper does not adjust for differences in trial patient populations and is particularly data-intensive, use of such sophisticated methods of evidence synthesis may be more informative for subsequent cost-effectiveness modelling and may have greater impact when considering an indication where observed data is particularly immature or survival prospects are more positive, which may then lead to more informative decision-making for drug reimbursement.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28680955,PMC5488131

This paper reviews the efficacy and tolerability of switching to vortioxetine. All three published studies of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) switched from SSRI/SNRI therapy to vortioxetine due to lack of efficacy or tolerability were selected. Vortioxetine was evaluated versus agomelatine directly (REVIVE) and versus sertraline, venlafaxine, bupropion, and citalopram in an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) from switch studies retrieved in a literature review. Vortioxetine׳s impact on SSRI-induced treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) was assessed directly versus escitalopram (NCT01364649) in stable patients with MDD. Vortioxetine׳s tolerability in the switch population was compared to the overall MDD population. Vortioxetine showed significant benefits over agomelatine on efficacy, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes, with fewer withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs) (REVIVE). Vortioxetine had numerically higher remission rates versus all therapies included (ITC). Withdrawal rates due to AEs were significantly lower for vortioxetine versus sertraline, venlafaxine, and bupropion, and numerically lower versus citalopram. Switching to vortioxetine was statistically superior to escitalopram in improving TESD (NCT01364649). Tolerability was similar in the switch and overall MDD populations. These findings suggest that vortioxetine is an effective switch therapy for patients with MDD whose response to SSRI/SNRI therapy is inadequate. Vortioxetine was well tolerated and, for patients with a history of TESD, showed significant advantages versus escitalopram. Vortioxetine appears to be a valid option for patients with MDD who have not been effectively treated with first-line pharmacotherapies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28663124,

As efficacy and safety rates converge, prescribers and payers need to consider value for money. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the health economic value of daclatasvir + asunaprevir versus sofosbuvir/ledipasvir via a cost-effectiveness analysis, and determine the optimal treatment considering both costs and health outcomes in Japan. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir + asunaprevir compared with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir on the basis of a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of pivotal trials and modeling inputs specific to the Japanese setting. A de novo budget impact model was developed and used to predict the cost implications of differing treatment sequences. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness results demonstrated minimal difference in terms of benefit (0.037 fewer QALYs and 0.014 fewer life-years with daclatasvir + asunaprevir); nevertheless, a significant difference in cost was predicted (estimated ¥2,299,700 [US $21,695] reduction with daclatasvir + asunaprevir). The budget impact analysis estimated that treatment with daclatasvir + asunaprevir is expected to be less expensive than treatment with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (as the proportion of patients initially treated with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir increased from 0% to 100%, total costs increased from ¥206 to ¥403 billion [US $1.94 billion to US $3.80 billion]). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of results from an established cost-effectiveness model and a conventional budget impact analysis, treatment with daclatasvir + asunaprevir is expected to be cost-saving compared with treatment with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in Japan with similar health outcomes, regardless of treatment sequence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_paitc",28648305,

Two broad approaches are available to synthesise data across networks, namely, arm- and contrast-synthesis models, with a range of models that can be fitted within each. There has been recent debate about the validity of the arm-synthesis models, but to date, there has been limited empirical evaluation comparing results using the methods applied to a large number of networks. We aim to address this gap through the re-analysis of a large cohort of published networks of interventions using a range of network meta-analysis methods. METHODS: We will include a subset of networks from a database of network meta-analyses of randomised trials that have been identified and curated from the published literature. The subset of networks will include those where the primary outcome is binary, the number of events and participants are reported for each direct comparison, and there is no evidence of inconsistency in the network. We will re-analyse the networks using three contrast-synthesis methods and two arm-synthesis methods. We will compare the estimated treatment effects, their standard errors, treatment hierarchy based on the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve, the SUCRA value, and the between-trial heterogeneity variance across the network meta-analysis methods. We will investigate whether differences in the results are affected by network characteristics and baseline risk. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will inform whether, in practice, the choice of network meta-analysis method matters, and if it does, in what situations differences in the results between methods might arise. The results from this research might also inform future simulation studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",28646922,PMC5483272

Nonsurgical procedures such as uterine artery embolization (UAE) have been developed. The goal of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis and an indirect treatment comparison to examine the comparative efficacy and safety of the surgical procedures to treat SULs compared with UAE. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Lilacs, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to February 2016. Ten randomized controlled trials comparing UAE versus hysterectomy, myomectomy, and laparoscopic occlusion of the uterine arteries in patients with SUL published in a peer-reviewed journal were included. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus. FINDINGS: Data from 986 patients submitted to UEA (n = 527) or surgery (n = 459) were analyzed. UAE had a lower risk of major complications (risk ratio [RR], 0.45 [95% CI, 0.22-0.95]; P = 0.04)and a higher risk of minor complications (RR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.32-2.06]; P < 0.00001); UAE had a higher risk of re-intervention up to 2 years (RR, 3.74 [95% CI, 1.76-7.96]; P = 0.0006) and up to 5 years (RR, 5.01 [95% CI, 1.37-18.39]; P = 0.02); UAE had a similar risk of follicle-stimulating hormone levels >40 IU/L after 6 months (RR, 1.76 [95% CI, 0.24-12.95]; P = 0.58)and of recommending the procedure to another patient up to 5 years after treatment (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.87-1.14]; P = 0.94). The indirect comparison between myomectomy and hysterectomy found that the 2 procedures were similar in the studied outcomes. IMPLICATIONS: Compared with surgery, UAE had lower rates of major complications with an increased risk of re-intervention up to 2 and 5 years after the first procedure. UAE compared with surgery had a similar risk of ovarian failure and similar recommendation of the procedure to another patient. However, the number of trials was limited, and there was a high risk of bias in at least 2 domains. None of the trials blinded the participants and personnel or the outcome assessment.

We examined the comparative effectiveness of the two drugs using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) versus an unadjusted indirect comparison. METHODS: After comparing trials and identifying potential prognostic factors, an MAIC was conducted to adjust for differences in key patient baseline characteristics. Due to BOLT's small sample size, the number of matching variables was restricted to two. Efficacy results for sonidegib were generated so that selected baseline characteristics matched those from ERIVANCE and were compared with published ERIVANCE results. RESULTS: Matching variables were baseline percentages of patients receiving prior radiotherapy and surgery. After weighting, sonidegib objective response rate (ORR) and median progression-free survival (PFS) were effectively unchanged (prematched versus postmatched ORR and PFS, 56.1% versus 56.7% and 22.1 versus 22.1 months, resp.). Vismodegib's ORR and PFS were 47.6% and 9.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative effectiveness of sonidegib versus vismodegib remains unchanged after adjusting BOLT patient-level data to match published ERIVANCE baseline percentages of patients receiving prior surgery and radiotherapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",28607774,PMC5457749

Many therapeutic agents have been approved for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), particularly as a post-docetaxel treatment strategy. The objective of this systematic literature review was to assess published efficacy and safety data for select mCRPC therapies - such as abiraterone, cabazitaxel, and enzalutamide - in the post-docetaxel setting. METHODS: Database searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL, in conjunction with hand searches of multiple congress abstracts, yielded 13 randomized studies and 107 non-randomized studies that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Randomized studies demonstrated significant improvements in median overall survival (OS) outcomes over placebo for abiraterone (15.8 vs. 11.2 months) and enzalutamide (18.4 vs. 13.6 months), and similar significant improvements were noted for cabazitaxel over mitoxantrone (15.1 vs. 12.7 months). Differences in progression-free survival (PFS) were similarly significant, although variance in the criteria for measuring PFS may limit the extent to which these outcomes can be compared between studies. Non-randomized evidence included multiple publications from several early access and compassionate use programs with a primary objective to report safety outcomes. Results from these studies largely reflected the findings in randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is a growing body of evidence for post-docetaxel treatment options available in patients with mCRPC. Further head-to-head trials or indirect treatment comparisons may be a valuable method to assess the comparative efficacy of these therapies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",28604117,

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a meta-epidemiological survey using a systematic review of NMAs published in 2013 and identified through MEDLINE and Embase databases. RESULTS: The review identified 77 NMAs. The most common type of effect modifiers identified and explored were patient characteristics (50.7% or 39/77), and the most common adjustment method used was sensitivity analysis (51.7% or 30/58). Over 45% (35/77) of studies did not describe a plan, nearly 40% (30/77) did not report the results of analyses, and approximately 47% (36/77) of studies had incomplete reporting. Exploratory univariate regression analyses yielded a statistically significant association for the variables of journal impact factor, ratio of randomized controlled trials to number of comparisons, and total number of randomized controlled trials. CONCLUSION: Current reporting practices are largely deficient, given that almost half of identified published NMAs do not explore or report effect modification. Journal impact factor and amount of available information in a network were associated with completeness of reporting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",28603010,

No trials directly comparing their efficacy are available. Therefore a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to provide insight into their relative efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). MAIC attempts to adjust for between-trial differences in factors known or suspected to influence treatment effects, to minimize bias. METHODS: A MAIC within a Bayesian framework was conducted using individual patient data from the RESONATE-2 study of ibr versus chlorambucil and published data from the CLL11 study of obi versus chlorambucil. Both studies were conducted in patients ineligible for full-dose fludarabine-based therapy. After matching, the reweighted adjusted relative efficacy measure of ibr versus chlorambucil from RESONATE-2 [hazard ratio (HR), 95% credible interval (CrI)] was compared with that of obi versus chlorambucil from CLL11 for each endpoint, using a Bayesian indirect comparison. RESULTS: Our results suggest that in a population with similar average baseline characteristics to CLL11, ibr would improve PFS and OS outcomes compared to obi. Before matching, the HRs for ibr versus obi were 0.48 [CrI = 0.22-1.02, p(HR <1) = 97%], 0.85 [CrI = 0.44-1.63, p(HR <1) = 69%], and 0.40 [CrI = 0.10-1.54, p(HR <1) = 91%] for PFS by investigator assessment, PFS by independent review committee, and OS, respectively. After matching on all available characteristics the HRs decreased to 0.12 [CrI = 0.02-0.97, p(HR <1) = 98%], 0.24 [CrI = 0.04-1.35, p(HR <1) = 95%], and 0.21 [CrI = <0.01-8.89, p(HR <1) = 79%], respectively. There was a large variance around the treatment effect for OS due to the low number of deaths. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that ibrutinib is highly likely to provide greater PFS benefit than obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in older or less fit patients with previously untreated CLL. There is also an indication of improvement in OS, albeit with a higher uncertainty due to the low number of events.

RESULTS: Higher FIX activity showed reduced ABRs (p < 0.001). Target joints resulted in higher bleed rates (p < 0.001). When FIX activity levels and bleed risks were applied to the Markov model, ABRs for nonacog beta pegol and its comparator were 2.40 and 6.36, respectively.

Because previous meta-analyses only included a limited number of adjusted studies or several non-adjusted studies, our goal was to compare and summarize the outcomes of TF-TAVI vs SAVR and TF-TAVI vs TA-TAVI exclusively with the RCT and propensity-matched cohort studies with direct and adjusted indirect comparisons to reach more precise conclusions. We hypothesized that TF-TAVI would offer surgical candidates a better outcome compared with SAVR and TA-TAVI because of its potential for fewer myocardial injuries. A literature search was conducted through PUBMED and EMBASE through June 2016. Only RCTs and propensity-matched cohort studies were included. A direct meta-analysis of TF-TAVI vs SAVR, TA-TAVI vs SAVR and TF-TAVI vs TA-TAVI was conducted. Then, the effect size of an indirect meta-analysis was calculated from the direct meta-analysis. The effect sizes of direct and indirect meta-analyses were then combined. A random-effects model was used to calculate the hazards ratio and the odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. Early (in-hospital or 30 days) and mid-term (≥1 year) all-cause mortality rates were assessed. Our search resulted in 4 RCTs (n = 2319) and 14 propensity-matched cohort (n = 7217) studies with 9536 patients of whom 3471, 1769 and 4296 received TF, TA and SAVR, respectively. Direct meta-analyses and combined direct and indirect meta-analyses of early and mid-term deaths with TF-TAVI and SAVR were similar. Early deaths with TF-TAVI vs TA-TAVI were comparable in direct meta-analyses (odds ratio 0.64, P = 0.35) and direct and indirect meta-analyses combined (odds ratio 0.73, P = 0.24). Mid-term deaths with TF-TAVI vs TA-TAVI were increased (hazard ratio 0.83, P = 0.07) in a direct meta-analysis and became significant after addition of the indirect meta-analysis (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.92, P = 0.003). In conclusion, TF-TAVI was associated with similar early and mid-term deaths compared with SAVR.

To synthesize the evidence and provide the hierarchies of different circumcisions for phimosis and redundant prepuce, we performed an overall network meta-analysis (NMA) based on their comparative efficacy and safety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Wan Fang, VIP, CNKI and CBM database were researched from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for redundant prepuce or phimosis. We conducted the direct and indirect comparisons by aggregate data drug information system (ADDIS) software. Moreover, consistency models were applied to assess the differences among the male circumcision practices, and the ranks based on probabilities of intervention for the different endpoints were performed. Node-splitting analysis was used to test inconsistency. RESULTS: Eighteen RCTs were included with 6179 participants. Compared with the conventional circumcision(CC), two new styles of circumcisions, the disposable circumcision suture device(DCSD) and Shang Ring circumcision(SRC), provided significantly shorter operation time[DCSD: standardized mean difference (SMD) = -20.60, 95% credible interval(CI) (-23.38, -17.82); SRC: SMD = -19.16, 95%CI (-21.86, -16.52)], shorter wound healing time [DCSD:SMD = -4.19, 95%CI (-8.24,-0.04); SRC: SMD = 4.55, 95%CI (1.62, 7.57); ] and better postoperative penile appearance [DCSD: odds ratios odds ratios (OR) = 11.42, 95%CI (3.60, 37.68); SRC: OR = 3.85,95%CI (1.29, 12.79)]. Additionally, DCSD showed a lower adverse events rate than other two treatments. However, no significant difference was shown in all surgeries for 24 h postoperative pain score. Node-splitting analysis showed that no significant inconsistency was existed (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of NMA, DCSD may be a most effective and safest choice for phimosis and redundant prepuce. DCSD has the advantages of a shorter operation time, better postoperative penile appearance, fewer complication and shorter wound healing time.

In this article, based on indirect comparisons, we proposed several methods to assessing bioequivalence and interchangeability between generics. The applicability of the methods and the similarity assumptions were discussed, as well as the inappropriateness of directly adopting adjusted indirect comparison to the field of generics' comparison. Besides, some extensions were given to take into consideration the important topics in clinical trials for bioequivalence assessments, for example, multiple comparisons and simultaneously testing bioequivalence among three generics. Extensive simulation studies were conducted to investigate the performances of the proposed methods. The studies of malaria generics and HIV/AIDS generics prequalified by the WHO were used as real examples to demonstrate the use of the methods.

This study compared the efficacy of daratumumab monotherapy versus historical controls through adjusted treatment comparison. Patient-level data were pooled from two daratumumab monotherapy studies (16 mg/kg; GEN501 and SIRIUS) and two independent US databases (IMS LifeLink and OPTUM), which reflect treatments used in real-world patients with MM who received ≥3 prior LOTs or were double refractory to a PI and an IMiD. Using a multivariate proportional hazards regression model, the relative treatment effect of daratumumab versus historical controls was estimated, adjusting for imbalances in characteristics between cohorts. Baseline characteristics that differed between patients treated with daratumumab (N = 148) and historical control (N = 658) were prior treatment with pomalidomide (55% vs 15%) or carfilzomib (41% vs 28%) and triple/quadruple refractory status (64% vs 14%). The adjusted overall survival-hazard ratio (OS-HR) for daratumumab versus historical control was 0.33 (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.46) compared with 0.46 (0.35-0.59) for unadjusted HR. Impact of adjustment was mainly driven by refractory status and prior pomalidomide/carfilzomib exposure.

The objective of the study was to investigate the potential for early vocational rehabilitation (VR) interventions for people with spinal cord injury (SCI) in overcoming barriers in returning to work, and to pinpoint factors contributing to effectiveness in early VR intervention for this population. The setting was at Queensland, Australia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesis of the findings of a literature search of online databases ProQuest and CINAHL, using keywords relating to the employment situation and VR of people with SCI. Themes were identified and analysed in accordance with the research objectives. RESULTS: Despite increasing government commitment to the workforce and social participation of people with disabilities, Australians living with SCI have significantly diminished employment outcomes compared with the general population. Current VR approaches usually do not commence until some months post discharge, potentially missing a window of opportunity to preserve pre-existing employment or assist in vocational decision making. The review found that there are opportunities for enhancing VR service provision following SCI, namely integrating the VR programme within the primary rehabilitation team thus facilitating early VR intervention. DISCUSSION: Emerging evidence shows promising results for early intervention in VR; however, questions remain regarding ideal intervention approaches, and it is clear that further empirical investigation is required to support the use of early intervention models post SCI.

METHODS: We conduct a simulation study where we consider three different scenarios: I) similar study populations, II) dissimilar study populations without interactions and III) dissimilar study populations with interactions between treatment effect and effect modifiers. We simulate data from a Cox model with Weibull distributed survival times. Desired are unbiased effect estimates. We compare the power and the proportion of type 1 errors of the methods. RESULTS: I) Bucher and MAIC perform equivalently well and yield unbiased effect estimates as well as proportions of type 1 errors below the significance level of 5 %. II) Both Bucher and MAIC yield unbiased effect estimates, but Bucher shows a higher power for detection of true added benefit than MAIC. III) Only MAIC, but not Bucher yields unbiased effect estimates. When using robust variance estimation MAIC yields a proportion of type 1 error close to 5 %. In general, power of all methods for indirect comparisons is low. An increasing loss of power for the indirect comparisons can be observed as the true treatment effects decrease. CONCLUSION: Due to the great loss of power and the potential bias for indirect comparisons, head-to-head trials using the appropriate comparator as defined by the Federal Joint Committee should be conducted whenever possible. However, indirect comparisons are needed if no such direct evidence is available. To conduct indirect comparisons in case of a present common comparator and similar study populations in the trials to be compared, both Bucher and MAIC can be recommended. In case of using adjusted effect measures (such as Hazard Ratio), the violation of the similarity assumption has no relevant effect on the Bucher approach as long as interactions between treatment effect and effect modifiers are absent. Therefore Bucher can still be considered appropriate in this specific situation. In the authors' opinion, MAIC can be considered as an option (at least as sensitivity analysis to Bucher) if such interactions are present or cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, in practice MAIC is potentially biased and should always be considered with utmost care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",28361159,

These two treatments have recently been approved in the EU for the management of acute moderate-to-severe post-operative pain in adult patients. METHODS: As no head-to-head trials comparing SSTS and PCTS currently exist, indirect treatment comparison (ITC) analyses were conducted to evaluate SSTS or PCTS versus intravenous (IV) morphine PCA. RESULTS: Five studies, four assessing PCTS and one assessing SSTS, were included in this analysis. SSTS had statistical or numerical advantages over PCTS for both patient global assessment (PGA) and healthcare professional global assessment (HPGA) outcomes at all time points investigated. SSTS was also associated with greater patient ease of use (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.02-0.28) and a higher patient satisfaction score (WMD: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.05-0.57; p = .019) compared with PCTS. In terms of tolerability, all-cause withdrawals from treatment were reported to be less likely with SSTS (risk ratio: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.42-1.02). No significant differences were observed between SSTS and PCTS in terms of safety and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of direct head-to-head data, the combination of promising phase III trial results compared to IV morphine PCA, a SLR comparison against other opioid treatments, and the results of this exploratory analysis present a strong rationale in support of SSTS as a key option for management of post-operative pain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28294636,

The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of this by investigating whether innovative products from different countries are bioequivalent. METHODS: Data were collected from all generic drug applications received by the Taiwan regulatory authority 2012-2016. If a submission package contained BE studies, that generic product was compared separately with different reference products, and the resulting data included in this analysis. A method of adjusted indirect comparison was used to evaluate the BE of reference products from different sources. The relationship between in vitro dissolution and in vivo BE was also explored. RESULTS: The present study included 10 drugs and a total of 11 comparisons. Seven comparisons for maximum concentration (C (max)) (63.6%) and all comparisons (100.0%) for area under the curve up to last measurable time point (AUC) complied with the BE criterion. Similar in vitro dissolution profiles were observed in all comparisons. Among the comparisons that failed to demonstrate BE, only one was considered to be possibly related to product difference, with point estimates of indirect comparison for C (max) significantly greater than unity (22%). Discordance between in vitro and in vivo observations was probably due to either drugs with highly variable properties or a lack of discriminatory dissolution testing method. CONCLUSIONS: Although this retrospective analysis only included a few drugs and product formulation types, i.e., immediate release, delayed release, and orally disintegrating tablet, these preliminary results suggest that using a foreign reference product in BE studies for generic drug applications could be a feasible approach, but with some restrictions: comparable dissolution profiles, same innovator company, same size, weight, and type of coating as the domestic reference product, etc. Further investigations for other complex formulations are required.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",28283987,

AIM: To assess the relative cost-utility of the three DOACs compared with vitamin K antagonists. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model with 3-month cycles was used to simulate NVAF patients starting with treatment and followed up for their lifetime from the perspective of the National Health System. The model included 36 health states including treatment combinations, disability and events history and considered a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 NVAF patients. Relative efficacy was calculated from a formal indirect treatment comparison using data from the pivotal trials of each DOAC. RESULTS: Dabigatran was associated with the highest number of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) (8.40 QALY), followed by apixaban (8.33 QALY), rivaroxaban (8.15 QALY) and acenocoumarol (8.03 QALY). Patients taking acenocoumarol had the lowest total costs (€22,230), followed by dabigatran (€24,564), apixaban (€24,655) and rivaroxaban (€25,900). Incremental cost-utility ratios compared to vitamin K antagonists, were €6,397, €8,039 and €29,957/QALY for dabigatran, apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively. If compared together, dabigatran dominated apixaban and rivaroxaban. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the baseline case. CONCLUSIONS: All three direct anticoagulants are cost-effective against acenocoumarol. Dabigatran is economically dominant over rivaroxaban and apixaban in the Spanish setting, as it is more effective and cheaper.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28272725,

Tetrabenazine was assessed for treating chorea in the TETRA-HD trial, and while efficacious, there are tolerability concerns possibly due to its pharmacokinetic properties. Deutetrabenazine is a novel VMAT2 inhibitor that contains deuterium, which extends active metabolite half-lives and minimizes drug concentration fluctuations. In the First-HD trial, deutetrabenazine was efficacious in treating chorea and was generally well tolerated. In the absence of a head-to-head trial, we performed an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of the tolerability of deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine for the treatment of HD-associated chorea, as observed in the First-HD and TETRA-HD trials, using well-established comparison methods. METHODS: Data from the Phase III, 12-week, parallel-group, clinical trials First-HD (N = 90) and TETRA-HD (N = 84) were used to conduct an ITC of the tolerability of deutetrabenazine versus tetrabenazine using two anchor-based methods: Bucher comparison for unadjusted ITCs, and matching indirect comparison for adjusted ITCs. Overall adverse events (AEs; mild, moderate, and severe), serious AEs, specific AEs occurring in ≥10% of patients, and discontinuations (all-cause and AE-related) were included in the analysis. The risk differences of these outcomes for deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine were estimated by subtracting the applicable placebo-adjusted risk in First-HD from that of TETRA-HD. Sensitivity analyses were performed to address differences between trials, and p-values were obtained from z-tests. RESULTS: Compared with tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine was associated with a significantly lower risk of moderate to severe AEs and neuropsychiatric AEs including agitation, akathisia, depression, depression/agitated depression, drowsiness/somnolence, insomnia, and parkinsonism in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses (p < 0.05 for each). Deutetrabenazine had a significantly lower rate of dose reduction or dose reduction/suspension in the unadjusted and adjusted analyses (p < 0.001 for each). Deutetrabenazine resulted in numerically more mild AEs, such as diarrhea and coughing; however, these results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This indirect treatment comparison demonstrates that for the treatment of HD chorea, deutetrabenazine has a favorable tolerability profile compared to tetrabenazine.

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence issued two documents which give slightly varying algorithms of pharmacotherapy for OAB, offering mirabegron as a possible treatment in certain circumstances. In the absence of trials involving a direct comparison of therapies, an indirect comparison can provide useful information on the difference in treatment effects between competing interventions. OBJECTIVE: To compare effectiveness of available medical therapies for OAB using Bucher indirect treatment comparison (ITC) model. METHODS: A systematic literature search identified randomised controlled trials (RCT) assessing effectiveness of drugs for OAB versus placebo. Then indirect comparisons of the treatments effects were made, preserving the randomisation of the originally assigned patient groups, using Bucher method. MAIN RESULTS: 25 RCTs met inclusion criteria. In keeping with ITC method validity, four assessments were undertaken of mirabegron against anticholinergics, which were number of incontinence episodes, micturition episodes, urgency episodes in 24 h and volume of micturition. This indirect treatment analysis suggests that mirabegron is as effective as anticholinergics in managing of OAB, except for solifenacin which appears to be superior. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that work looking into treatment choice should be individualized to patient characteristics rather than fitting patients to a treatment. Further work is required to identify what patient characteristics may be crucial and indicate that studies exploring the most effective sequence of managing treatment naïve patients and those with refractory disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28220521,

Patients with both eosinophilic and allergic asthma phenotypes may be eligible for treatment with mepolizumab and omalizumab. Evidence on the relative effectiveness of these treatments in this 'overlap' population would be informative for clinical and payer decision making. METHODS: A systematic literature review and indirect treatment comparison (Bayesian framework) were performed to assess the comparative effectiveness and tolerability of mepolizumab and omalizumab, as add-ons to standard of care. Studies included in the primary analysis were double-blind, randomized controlled trials, ≥12 weeks' duration enrolling patients with severe asthma with a documented exacerbation history and receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus ≥1 additional controller. Two populations were examined: patients potentially eligible for 1) both treatments (Overlap population) and 2) either treatment (Trial population). RESULTS: In the Overlap population, no differences between treatments in clinically significant exacerbations and exacerbations requiring hospitalization were found, although trends favored mepolizumab (rate ratio [RR]:0.66 [95% credible intervals (Crl):0.37,1.19]; 0.19[0.02,2.32], respectively). In the Trial population, mepolizumab treatment produced greater reductions in clinically significant exacerbations (RR:0.63 [95% CrI:0.45,0.89]) but not exacerbations requiring hospitalization compared with omalizumab (RR:0.58 [95% Crl: 0.16,2.13]), although the trend favored mepolizumab. Both treatments had broadly comparable effects on lung function, and similar tolerability profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst this analysis has limitations due to a restricted evidence base and residual heterogeneity, it showed that in patients with severe asthma, mepolizumab seems to be at least as effective as omalizumab and that the tolerability profiles of the two treatments did not meaningfully differentiate.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28137490,

The Cochrane Review which examined the effect of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for chronic LBP concluded that SMT is moderately effective, but was based on conventional meta-analysis of aggregate data. The use of individual participant data (IPD) from trials allows for a more precise estimate of the treatment effect and has the potential to identify moderators and/or mediators. The aim is (1) to assess the overall treatment effect of SMT for primary and secondary outcomes in adults with chronic LBP, (2) to determine possible moderation of baseline characteristics on treatment effect, (3) to identify characteristics of intervention (e.g., manipulation/mobilization) that influence the treatment effect, and (4) to identify mediators of treatment effects. METHODS: All trials included in the Cochrane Review on SMT for chronic LBP will be included which were published after the year 2000, and the search will be updated. No restrictions will be placed on the type of comparison or size of the study. Primary outcomes are pain intensity and physical functioning. A dataset will be compiled consisting of individual trials and variables included according to a predefined coding scheme. Variables to be included are descriptive of characteristics of the study, treatment, comparison, participant characteristics, and outcomes at all follow-up periods. A one-stage approach with a mixed model technique based on the intention-to-treat principle will be used for the analysis. Subsequent analyses will focus on treatment effect moderators and mediators. DISCUSSION: We will analyze IPD for LBP trials in which SMT is one of the interventions. IPD meta-analysis has been shown to be more reliable and valid than aggregate data meta-analysis, although this difference might also be attributed to the number of studies that can be used or the amount of data that can be utilized. Therefore, this project may identify important gaps in our knowledge with respect to prognostic factors of treatment effects.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost effectiveness of insulin degludec plus liraglutide (IDegLira, Xultophy(®)) compared with six potential intensification treatment options for patients with T2DM that is uncontrolled with basal insulin. METHODS: The Swedish Institute for Health Economics (IHE) Cohort Model of Type 2 Diabetes was used with Swedish input data, a 40-year time frame and a societal perspective. The comparators for treatment intensification included insulin glargine, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, insulin aspart plus either glargine or NPH, and liraglutide plus either glargine or NPH. Clinical data for all comparators (except NPH insulin) were based on an indirect treatment comparison of several studies. Prices were obtained from the 2014 Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (Tandvårds- och läkemedelsförmånsverket [TLV]) database, and utility values were obtained from published studies. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were Swedish krona (SEK) 70,000 or lower per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). IDegLira compared with intensified basal insulin showed an ICER of SEK 28,000 per QALY versus insulin glargine, SEK70,000 per QALY versus NPH insulin and SEK 60,000 per QALY versus NPH insulin plus liraglutide. IDegLira was dominant over insulin glargine plus liraglutide and insulin aspart plus insulin glargine or NPH insulin. Results were driven by the difference in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) reduction between treatments, as confirmed by sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: IDegLira is estimated to be a cost-effective treatment in Sweden compared with commonly used intensification treatments for patients with T2DM uncontrolled with basal insulin.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28063135,PMC5343072

Until recently, few effective treatment options existed, and even with the advent of new agents, studies evaluating comparative efficacy are scarce. In the Ibrutinib Versus Ofatumumab in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE) Phase III study, ibrutinib, an oral, once-a-day, first-in-class covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with ofatumumab (PFS hazard ratio [HR] = 0.106 and OS HR = 0.369 [adjusted for crossover] at a median of 16 months' follow-up). We sought to establish the relative efficacy of ibrutinib versus other treatment options for patients with R/R CLL using indirect comparison methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify clinical trials sharing a common treatment arm with the RESONATE Phase III trial such that a network meta-analysis or indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) could be conducted. Two trials were identified, each using the same comparator (ofatumumab) as the RESONATE study. Two pairwise ITCs were conducted using the Bucher method to establish the relative treatment efficacy of ibrutinib versus (1) idelalisib plus ofatumumab in the first study and (2) physician's choice, defined as a mix of therapies commonly used in R/R CLL, in the second study. Odds ratios for these ITCs were calculated for overall response rate (ORR) and HRs for PFS and OS. FINDINGS: A strong and consistent trend of superiority for ibrutinib was observed via these ITC models with idelalisib plus ofatumumab and physician's choice for ORR, PFS, and OS. Ibrutinib revealed prolonged PFS and OS versus comparators (PFS HR = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.11; and OS HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.54), physician's choice (PFS HR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25-0.66; and OS HR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.23-1.08), and idelalisib plus ofatumumab. These findings were robust and continued to favor ibrutinib when adjusting (where appropriate) for underlying differences in patient population between the trials. Some trial differences were not accounted for in the models and thus some limitations remain; however, consistency of results supports the overall findings. IMPLICATIONS: In a randomized Phase III study, ibrutinib significantly improved ORR, PFS, and OS in patients with R/R CLL versus ofatumumab. In ITC models that used ofatumumab as the common comparator, ibrutinib appears to have higher ORR and longer PFS and OS versus both idelalisib plus ofatumumab and physician's choice. In the absence of head-to-head studies and taking into consideration inherent limitations of ITCs, these models provide useful estimates of comparative efficacy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",28062113,

The introduction of BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations has yielded significant increases in PFS and OS for melanoma. However, at present, no direct comparisons between different BRAF/MEK combinations have been conducted. In light of this, an indirect treatment comparison was performed between two BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapies for metastatic melanoma, dabrafenib plus trametinib and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, in order to understand the relative efficacy and toxicity profiles of these therapies. METHODS: A systematic literature search identified two randomized trials as suitable for indirect comparison: the coBRIM trial of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib versus vemurafenib and the COMBI-v trial of dabrafenib plus trametinib versus vemurafenib. The comparison followed the method of Bucher et al. and analyzed both efficacy (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS], and overall response rate [ORR]) and safety outcomes (adverse events [AEs]). RESULTS: The indirect comparison revealed similar efficacy outcomes between both therapies, with no statistically significant difference between therapies for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 - 1.30), PFS (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79 - 1.40), or ORR (risk ratio [RR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 - 1.10).

It is important to compare therapies to guide the treatment decision-making process, and establishing the relationship between older agents can strengthen the networks of evidence for newer therapies. We report the outcome of an indirect comparison of GM-CSF, dacarbazine, and gp100 in metastatic melanoma through meta-analysis of absolute treatment effect. METHODS: A systematic literature review identified trials for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A valid network meta-analysis was not feasible: treatment-specific meta-analysis was conducted. A published algorithm was used to adjust overall survival estimates from trials of GM-CSF, dacarbazine, and gp100 for heterogeneity in baseline prognostic factors. Survival estimates were compared in three patient groups: stage IIIB-IV M1c, stage IIIB-IV M1a, and stage IV M1b/c. RESULTS: One trial of GM-CSF, four of dacarbazine, and one of gp100 were included in the analysis. After adjusting for differences in baseline prognostic factors, median overall survival (OS) in all patient groups was longer for those receiving GM-CSF than for those receiving dacarbazine or gp100. The observed survival over time for GM-CSF was similar to the adjusted survival for dacarbazine and greater than for gp100 in all patient groups. CONCLUSION: The relative treatment effect of GM-CSF, dacarbazine, and gp100 has been reliably estimated by adjusting for differences in baseline prognostic factors. Results suggest that OS with GM-CSF is at least as good as with dacarbazine and greater than with gp100. Given the role of these agents as controls in phase 3 trials of new immunotherapies and targeted agents, these results can be used to contextualize the efficacy of newer therapies.

The efficacy and safety of two different doses of evolocumab were evaluated and the safety of evolocumab was compared with that of a placebo and ezetimibe. PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched and randomized controlled trials that examined the effect and safety of evolomucab compared with a placebo and ezetimibe were retrieved. Two authors independently performed article reviews and study quality evaluations. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a fixed or random-effects model [95% confidence intervals (CIs)]. In the direct comparison, a significant reduction was observed in the muscle-associated events compared with ezetimibe [OR=0.54 (95% CI, 0.31-0.93); P (Z)=0.03, P (Q)=0.43, I(2)=0%]. In the adjusted indirect comparison of evolocumab 140 mg Q2W vs. evolocumab 420 mg Q4W, no significant differences in efficacy [OR=1.04 (95% CI, 0.55-1.99); P (Z)=0.90] or adverse events [OR=1.08 (95% CI, 0.66-1.74); P (Z)=0.76] were identified. The funnel plots of these direct comparison studies indicated that there was no publication bias. The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that evolocumab significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and no difference was noted between evolocumab 140 mg Q2W and evolocumab 420 mg Q4W. Furthermore, evolocumab had fewer muscle-associated events than ezetimibe.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",27882214,PMC5103663

We introduce a new proof-of-concept strategy to a VLU clinical evidence network, propensity score matching and sensitivity analysis to predict the feasibility of the new acellular synthetic matrix plus SC for success in future randomised, controlled clinical trials. Prospective data on chronic VLUs from a safety and effectiveness study on an acellular synthetic matrix conducted in one wound centre in the UK (17 patients) and three wound centres in Australia (36 patients) were compared retrospectively to propensity score-matched data from patients with comparable leg ulcer disease aetiology, age, baseline ulcer area, ulcer duration, multi-layer compression bandaging and majority of care completed in specialist wound centres (average of 1 visit per week), with the outcome measures at comparable follow-up periods from patients enrolled in four prospective, multicentre, pragmatic, randomised studies of venous ulcers in the UK (the comparison group; VLU evidence network). Analysis using Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a mean healing time of 73·1 days for ASM plus SC (ASM) treated ulcers in comparison with 83·5 days for comparison group ulcers treated with SC alone (Log rank test, χ(2) 5·779, P = 0·016) within 12 weeks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that an unobserved covariate would have to change the odds of healing for SC by a factor of 1·1 to impact the baseline results. Results from this study predict a significant effect on healing time when using a new ASM as an adjunct to SC in the treatment of non-healing venous ulcers in the UK, but results are sensitive to unobserved covariates that may be important in healing time comparison.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",27868341,PMC7949811

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through April 2016. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity-score matched (PSM) studies. We performed a DC-MA-[A] of SL-AVR versus TAVI, a DC-MA-[B] of SL-AVR versus conventional AVR (C-AVR), and a DC-MA-[C] TAVI versus C-AVR. Then, we computed a IDC-MA-[A'] of TAVI versus SL-AVR from the results of the DC-MA-[B] and the DC-MA-[C]. RESULTS: We identified 6 RCTs and 30 PSM studies enrolling a total of 15,887 patients. The 3 DC-MAs demonstrated significantly lower perioperative (30-day or in-hospital) all-cause mortality after SL-AVR than after TAVI (odds ratio [OR], 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28 to 0.80; p=0.005) and no significant differences between SL-AVR and C-AVR (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.94; p=0.81) and between TAVI and C-AVR (1.07; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.27; p=0.45). The computed IDC-MA-[A'] indicated no significant difference in mortality between SL-AVR and TAVI (1.01; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.86). Combining the results of the DC-MA-[A] and IDC-MA [A'] showed significantly lower mortality after SL-AVR than after TAVI (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.97; p=0.03).

METHODS: The Cardiff Diabetes Model, an economic model designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of comparator therapies in diabetes was used to simulate disease progression and estimate the long-term effect of treatments on patients. Systematic literature reviews, hospital surveys, meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparison were conducted to obtain model-required patient profiles, clinical data and costs. Health insurance costs (2015¥) were estimated over 40 years from a healthcare payer perspective. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The model predicted that dapagliflozin had lower incidences of cardiovascular events, hypoglycemia and mortality events, was associated with a mean incremental benefit of 0.25 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and with a lower cost of ¥8,439 compared with acarbose. This resulted in a cost saving of ¥33,786 per QALY gained with dapagliflozin. Sensitivity analyses determined that the results are robust. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin is dominant compared with acarbose as monotherapy for Chinese T2DM patients, with a little QALY gain and lower costs. Dapagliflozin offers a well-tolerated and cost-effective alternative medication for treatment-naive patients in China, and may have a direct impact in reducing the disease burden of T2DM.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",27806087,PMC5091768

Areas covered: We performed a systematic review of medical databases to collect all eligible clinical trials referring to the topic of our analysis. Due to the lack of direct clinical trials comparing the drugs we used an adjusted indirect comparison of efficacy and safety of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by Bucher method. Expert commentary: Lenvatinib and sorafenib are drugs with strong evidence on efficacy in treatment of RR-DTC. Based on the currently available clinical data lenvatinib occurred more efficacious then sorafenib in RR-DTC therapy. Safety profile of the drugs was acceptable and comparative.

Both drugs enhance slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels. To date no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has directly compared ESL with LCM as add-on treatments for focal epilepsy. Our aim was to indirectly compare the efficacy of ESL and LCM used as add-on treatments in patients with focal epilepsy using common reference-based indirect comparison meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched RCTs in which ESL or LCM has been used as add-on treatment in patients with focal epilepsy and compared with placebo. Following outcomes were considered: ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency; seizure freedom; treatment withdrawal for any reason; ≥25% increase in seizure frequency. Random-effects Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses were performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for the efficacy of ESL or LCM versus placebo. Adjusted indirect comparisons were then made between ESL and LCM using the obtained results, and comparing the minimum and the highest effective recommended daily dose of each drug. RESULTS: Eight studies were included. Indirect comparisons adjusted for dose-effect showed no difference between ESL and LCM for responder rate, seizure freedom, and withdrawal rates. We could not assess increase in seizure frequency due to lack of data. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons failed to find a significant difference in efficacy between add-on ESL and LCM in patients with focal epilepsy.

Occasionally the efficacy of a treatment is assessed without a randomised comparator group (either active or placebo). OBJECTIVE: To identify and develop a taxonomic account of economic modelling approaches for pharmaceuticals licensed without RCT data. METHODS: We searched PubMed, the websites of UK health technology assessment bodies and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Scientific Presentations Database for assessments of treatments granted a marketing authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency from January 1999 to May 2014 without RCT data (74 indications). The outcome of interest was the approach to modelling efficacy data. RESULTS: Fifty-one unique models were identified in 29 peer-reviewed articles, 30 health technology appraisals, and 15 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research abstracts concerning 30 indications (44 indications had not been modelled). We noted the high rate of non-submission to health technology assessment agencies (28/98). The majority of models (43/51) were based on 'historical controls'-comparisons to previous meta-analysis or pooling of trials (5), individual trials (16), registries/case series (15), or expert opinion (7). Other approaches used the patient as their own control, performed threshold analysis, assumed time on treatment was added to overall survival, or performed cost-minimisation analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in the quality and approach of models constructed for drugs granted a marketing authorisation without a RCT. The most common approach is of a naive comparison to historical data (using other trials/registry data as a control group), which has considerable scope for bias.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc,review",27778240,

In phase 3 trials, DMF (DEFINE/CONFIRM) and fingolimod (FREEDOMS/FREEDOMS II) resulted in significant reductions in clinical and magnetic resonance imaging activity, with acceptable safety profiles. Direct comparisons of these treatments are not possible due to a lack of head-to-head trials. We compared 2 year efficacy of DMF versus fingolimod at the approved dosage using a matching-adjusted indirect approach. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individual patient data from DEFINE and CONFIRM, and aggregate data from FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II, were pooled and compared using the matching-adjusted in-direct method. To account for cross-trial differences, data from trials with available individual patient data were adjusted to match aggregate data (i.e. average patient characteristics) from trials without patient-level data. Data from DMF-treated patients were weighted such that average baseline characteristics matched those of fingolimod-treated patients. After matching, weighted treatment outcomes for DMF-treated patients (240 mg twice daily) were compared with summary outcomes for fingolimod-treated patients (0.5 mg once daily). All comparison results of DMF versus fingolimod used fingolimod as the reference. RESULTS: After matching, baseline characteristics were balanced between DMF and fingolimod. At year 2, the efficacy of DMF was similar to that of fingolimod for annualized relapse rate (rate ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.11 [0.88, 1.40]), 12 week confirmed disability progression (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.90 [0.63, 1.29]), and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (mean difference [95% CI]: 0.04 [-0.05, 0.13]). For patient-reported outcomes (EuroQoL 5-Dimensions questionnaire), the mean differences (95% CI) were 0.05 (0.01, 0.08) for utility score and 3.22 (0.58, 5.86) for visual analog scale score, significantly favoring DMF. There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) for DMF versus fingolimod among matching-adjusted patients with complete NEDA data: rate ratio (95% CI): 0.92 (0.51, 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: Using the matching-adjusted indirect comparison approach, the efficacy of DMF and fingolimod were similar on all clinical outcomes, while patient-reported outcomes showed greater benefit with DMF. Study limitations include possible confounding from unobserved/unknown differences between trials, and trial length may have been insufficient to detect significant differences on disability progression.

There are well-established advantages to using individual patient data to perform network meta-analysis and methods for network meta-analysis of individual patient data have already been developed for dichotomous and time-to-event data. This paper describes appropriate methods for the network meta-analysis of individual patient data on continuous outcomes. METHODS: This paper introduces and describes network meta-analysis of individual patient data models for continuous outcomes using the analysis of covariance framework. Comparisons are made between this approach and change score and final score only approaches, which are frequently used and have been proposed in the methodological literature. A motivating example on the effectiveness of acupuncture for chronic pain is used to demonstrate the methods. Individual patient data on 28 randomised controlled trials were synthesised. Consistency of endpoints across the evidence base was obtained through standardisation and mapping exercises. RESULTS: Individual patient data availability avoided the use of non-baseline-adjusted models, allowing instead for analysis of covariance models to be applied and thus improving the precision of treatment effect estimates while adjusting for baseline imbalance. CONCLUSIONS: The network meta-analysis of individual patient data using the analysis of covariance approach is advocated to be the most appropriate modelling approach for network meta-analysis of continuous outcomes, particularly in the presence of baseline imbalance. Further methods developments are required to address the challenge of analysing aggregate level data in the presence of baseline imbalance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""To read to understand how they can find IPD for 28 studies""]}",27716074,PMC5053345

To date, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has directly compared BRV with ESL, LCM, or PER. PURPOSE: To compare BRV with the other add-on AEDs in patients with uncontrolled focal epilepsy, estimating their efficacy and tolerability through an adjusted, common-reference based indirect comparison meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched RCTs in which add-on treatment with ESL or LCM in patients with focal onset seizures have been compared with placebo. Efficacy and tolerability outcomes were considered. Random-effects Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses were performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for the efficacy of BRV, LCM, ESL, or PER versus placebo. Adjusted indirect comparisons were then made between BRV and the other three AEDs using the obtained results, comparing the minimum and the highest effective recommended daily dose of each drug. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs, with a total of 4971 patients were included. After adjusting for dose-effects, indirect comparisons showed no difference between BRV and LCM, ESL, or PER for responder rate and seizure freedom. Lower adverse events were observed with high dose BRV compared to high dose ESL or PER, but no difference was found in withdrawing because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons do not demonstrate a significant difference in efficacy between add-on BRV and LCM, ESL, or PER in focal epilepsy, and might suggest a better tolerability of BRV than ESL, and possibly also PER, at the highest effective recommended dose.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",27710868,

Generic medicines are approved by regulatory authorities based on the demonstration of bioequivalence with the innovator or reference product, as well as meeting quality standards. In clinical practice, however, it is not unusual for generics to be interchanged between each other. This study investigated the differences in bioavailability between WHO-prequalified first-line antiretroviral generics by means of adjusted indirect comparisons to ensure interchangeability between these generics. METHODS: Data on 34 products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine and efavirenz in single formulations or fixed-dose combinations were included in the analysis. The 90% CI for the adjusted indirect comparisons was calculated using the homoscedastic method that uses the conventional t-test, and assumes homogeneity of variances between the studies and small sample sizes. The combined standard deviation of both bioequivalence studies was calculated from the variability of each individual study. RESULTS: The adjusted indirect comparisons between generics showed that the differences, expressed as 90% CIs, are less than 30%. Confidence in the interchangeability of two generic products was reduced if the mean difference between the test and reference in the original studies is more than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: From a bioequivalence perspective, the generic antiretroviral medicines prequalified by WHO are interchangeable with the reference, as well as between each other without safety or efficacy concerns.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",27646863,

To address this issue, matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) measures treatment efficacy after weighting individual patient data to match patient characteristics across trials. To date, however, there is no consensus on how best to implement MAIC. To address this issue, we applied MAIC to measure how two attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatments (guanfacine extended release and atomoxetine hydrochloride) affect patients' ADHD symptoms, as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale IV score. We tested MAIC sensitivity to: matched patient characteristics, matched statistical moments, weighting matrix, and placebo-arm matching (i.e., matching on outcomes in the placebo arm). After applying MAIC, guanfacine and atomoxetine had similar reductions in ADHD symptoms (Δ: 0.4, p < 0.737). The results were similar for three of four sensitivity analyses. When we applied MAIC with placebo-arm matching, however, guanfacine reduced symptoms more than atomoxetine (Δ: -3.9, p < 0.004). We discuss the implication of this finding and advise MAIC practitioners to carefully consider the use of placebo-arm matching, depending on the presence of residual confounding across trials.

METHODS: A Markov cohort model in which patients were administered a sequence of treatments was used to predict long-term outcomes associated with each treatment. The model was informed by data from the eltrombopag clinical trial program and the available literature. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, and a lifetime time horizon was used. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Eltrombopag dominated romiplostim (i.e., eltrombopag was as effective as but less costly than romiplostim) in both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, assuming a class effect for the two treatments. Eltrombopag also dominated romiplostim in most deterministic sensitivity analyses with the exception of when indirect efficacy estimates were incorporated into the model. In this analysis, eltrombopag no longer dominated romiplostim but remained cost-effective versus romiplostim at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that there was a 99% and 92% chance of eltrombopag being cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, respectively.

METHODS: Studies comparing conventional (c)TACE versus (90)Y-radioembolization or DEB-TACE for HCC treatment were identified using PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The adjusted indirect meta-analytic method for effectiveness comparison of DEB-TACE versus (90)Y-radioembolization was used. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare baseline characteristics. A priori defined sensitivity analysis of stratified study subgroups was performed for primary outcome analyses. Publication bias was tested by Egger's and Begg's tests. RESULTS: Fourteen studies comparing DEB-TACE or (90)Y-radioembolization with cTACE were included. Analysis revealed a 1-year overall survival benefit for DEB-TACE over (90)Y-radioembolization (79 % vs. 54.8 %; OR: 0.57; 95 %CI: 0.355-0.915; p = 0.02; I-squared: 0 %; p > 0.5), but not for the 2-year (61 % vs. 34 %; OR: 0.65; 95%CI: 0.294-1.437; p = 0.29) and 3-year survival (56.4 % vs. 20.9 %; OR: 0.713; 95 % CI: 0.21-2.548; p = 0.62). There was significant heterogeneity in the 2- and 3-year survival analyses. The pooled median overall survival was longer for DEB-TACE (22.6 vs. 14.7 months). There was no significant difference in tumour response rate. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE and (90)Y-radioembolization are efficacious treatments for patients suffering from HCC; DEB-TACE demonstrated survival benefit at 1-year compared to (90)Y-radioembolization but direct comparison is warranted for further evaluation. KEY POINTS: • This meta-analysis shows greater 1-year survival benefit for DEB-TACE over (90) Y-radioembolization. • DEB-TACE has a favourable 2- & 3-year survival benefit trend over (90) Y-radioembolization. • No significant difference for tumour response was detected. • Direct comparison of these methods for a more robust evaluation is warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",27562480,

Recently, panobinostat plus bortezomib and DEX (PAN + BTZ + DEX) was licensed in this setting. The current study assessed the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes with PAN + BTZ + DEX versus LEN + DEX (primary comparator) and POM + DEX (exploratory comparator). METHODS: Since an anchor-based indirect treatment comparison was not feasible, the matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison approach was used. To compare the survival outcomes, patient-level data were generated for the comparators utilizing published Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. The use of approximated patient-level data and matched data for PAN + BTZ + DEX allowed the use of Cox proportional hazards models and the assessment of the proportional hazards assumption. In cases where there was evidence that the proportional hazards assumption was violated, time-dependent hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated. Median and mean values for PFS and OS were predicted. RESULTS: For both PFS and OS, the proportional hazards assumption was not satisfied, therefore time-dependent HRs were estimated. Using time-dependent HRs, the mean PFS was estimated to be 11.83 months for PAN + BTZ + DEX and 10.96 months for LEN + DEX. The corresponding mean OS estimates were 30.73 and 27.76 months, respectively. Comparisons with POM + DEX were affected by large uncertainty and did not allow making robust inferences. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study that combined matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison with time-dependent HRs to address changing patterns in the HR. The results suggest that treatment with PAN + BTZ + DEX and LEN + DEX are associated with similar mean PFS and OS in the third-line treatment setting of multiple myeloma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Use approximated patient-level data, to check""]}",27550239,

Most NMAs are based on published aggregate data (AD) and have limited possibilities for investigating the extent of network consistency and between-study heterogeneity. Given that individual participant data (IPD) are considered the gold standard in evidence synthesis, we explored statistical methods for IPD-NMA and investigated their potential advantages and limitations, compared with AD-NMA. We discuss several one-stage random-effects NMA models that account for within-trial imbalances, treatment effect modifiers, missing response data and longitudinal responses. We illustrate all models in a case study of 18 antidepressant trials with a continuous endpoint (the Hamilton Depression Score). All trials suffered from drop-out; missingness of longitudinal responses ranged from 21 to 41% after 6 weeks follow-up. Our results indicate that NMA based on IPD may lead to increased precision of estimated treatment effects. Furthermore, it can help to improve network consistency and explain between-study heterogeneity by adjusting for participant-level effect modifiers and adopting more advanced models for dealing with missing response data. We conclude that implementation of IPD-NMA should be considered when trials are affected by substantial drop-out rate, and when treatment effects are potentially influenced by participant-level covariates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",27487843,

The care of people with complex wounds is costly, with care mainly being delivered by community nurses. There is a lack of current, high-quality data regarding the numbers and types of people affected, care received and outcomes achieved. OBJECTIVES: To (1) assess how high-quality data about complex wounds can be captured effectively for use in both service planning and research while ensuring integration with current clinical data collection systems and minimal impact on staff time; (2) investigate whether or not a clinical register of people with complex wounds could give valid estimates of treatment effects, thus reducing dependence on large-scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs); (3) identify the most important research questions and outcomes for people with complex wounds from the perspectives of patients, carers and health-care professionals; (4) evaluate the potential contributions to decision-making of individual patient data meta-analysis and mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis; and (5) complete and update systematic reviews in topic areas of high priority. METHODS: To meet objectives 1 and 2 we conducted a prevalence survey and developed and piloted a longitudinal disease register. A consultative, deliberative method and in-depth interviews were undertaken to address objective 3. To address objectives 4 and 5 we conducted systematic reviews including mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. RESULTS: From the prevalence survey we estimated the point prevalence of all complex wounds to be 1.47 per 1000 people (95% confidence interval 1.38 to 1.56 per 1000 people). Pressure ulcers and venous leg ulcers were the most common type of complex wound. A total of 195 people with a complex wound were recruited to a complex wounds register pilot. We established the feasibility of correctly identifying, extracting and transferring routine NHS data into the register; however, participant recruitment, data collection and tracking individual wounds in people with multiple wounds were challenging. Most patients and health professionals regarded healing of the wound as the primary treatment goal. Patients were greatly troubled by the social consequences of having a complex wound. Complex wounds are frequently a consequence of, and are themselves, a long-term condition but treatment is usually focused on healing the wound. Consultative, deliberative research agenda setting on pressure ulcer prevention and treatment with patients, carers and clinicians yielded 960 treatment uncertainties and a top 12 list of research priorities. Of 167 RCTs of complex wound treatments in a systematic review of study quality, 41% did not specify a primary outcome and the overall quality of the conduct and reporting of the research was poor. Mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis in areas of high priority identified that matrix hydrocolloid dressings had the highest probability (70%) of being the most effective dressing for diabetic foot ulcers, whereas a hyaluronan fleece dressing had the highest probability (35%) of being the most effective dressing for venous ulcers; however, the quality of this evidence was low and uncertainty is high. CONCLUSIONS: Complex wounds are common and costly with a poor evidence base for many frequent clinical decisions. There is little routine clinical data collection in community nursing. A prospective complex wounds register has the potential to both assist clinical decision-making and provide important research evidence but would be challenging to implement without investment in information technology in NHS community services. Future work should focus on developing insights into typical wound healing trajectories, identifying factors that are prognostic for healing and assessing the cost-effectiveness of selected wound treatments.

This was a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) study of efficacy of BAY 81-8973 with antihemophilic factor (recombinant) plasma/albumin-free method (rAHF-PFM) and turoctocog alfa for the prophylaxis of severe hemophilia A. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify trials of rAHF-PFM and turoctocog alfa. Comparisons were conducted using BAY 81-8973 individual patient data (IPD) from LEOPOLD trials and published data from rAHF-PFM and turoctocog alfa trials. Differences in outcome reporting were reconciled using transformation of BAY 81-8973 IPD. Patients in pooled LEOPOLD trials were weighted to match baseline characteristics for rAHF-PFM or turoctocog alfa trials using MAICs. After matching, annualized bleed rates (ABRs) were compared using weighted t-tests. RESULTS: Two rAHF-PFM trials and one turoctocog alfa trial were identified. In these trials, rFVIIIs were dosed thrice weekly or every other day; in LEOPOLD trials, BAY 81-8973 was dosed twice- or thrice weekly. Three MAICs were conducted because the two rAHF-PFM trials calculated ABRs differently, matching for age, race, and weight (turoctocog alfa only). BAY 81-8973 had similar ABR of all bleeds vs rAHF-PFM (two trials: 4.8 vs 6.3, 1.9 vs 1.8 [square root transform]) and lower ABR of spontaneous bleeds and trauma bleeds (2.6 vs 4.1, 2.1 vs 4.7; both P<0.05). BAY 81-8973 showed lower ABR of all bleeds and spontaneous bleeds vs turoctocog alfa (4.3 vs 6.5, 2.8 vs 4.3; both P<0.05) and similar ABR of trauma bleeds (1.5 vs 1.6). In subgroup analysis, twice-weekly BAY 81-8973 had similar ABRs of all bleeds, spontaneous bleeds, and trauma bleeds compared to rAHF-PFM and turoctocog alfa. CONCLUSION: This indirect comparison found that prophylaxis with BAY 81-8973, even including the lower frequency of two times a week and lower factor VIII consumption, has efficacy comparable to rAHF-PFM and turoctocog alfa, which were dosed thrice weekly or every other day. The use of IPD enabled adjustments for differences in calculation of ABRs and population characteristics between trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",27445511,PMC4938137

Each state was assigned a health utility value representing patients' quality of life and a specific cost value. Comparisons between GClb and rituximab plus chlorambucil or only chlorambucil were performed using patient-level clinical trial data; other comparisons were performed via a network meta-analysis using information gathered in a systematic literature review. To support the model, a utility elicitation study was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. RESULTS: There was good agreement between the model-predicted progression-free and overall survival and that from the CLL11 trial. On incorporating data from the indirect treatment comparisons, it was found that GClb was cost-effective with a range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below a threshold of £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and remained so during deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses under various scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: GClb was estimated to increase both quality-adjusted life expectancy and treatment costs compared with several commonly used therapies, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below commonly referenced UK thresholds. This article offers a real example of how to combine direct and indirect evidence in a cost-effectiveness analysis of oncology drugs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",27325329,

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA367 issued in November 2015. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. Two phase III randomised controlled trials for a second-line population involving vortioxetine were identified-REVIVE and TAK318. These two trials represent only 972 of over 7000 patients included in trials of vortioxetine. In REVIVE, there was a statistically significant difference in depression scores favouring vortioxetine compared with agomelatine [mean Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score difference of 2.16 points; 95 % confidence interval 0.81-3.51]. The ERG concluded that, based on all the evidence, rather than the substantially restricted subset of evidence originally considered by the manufacturer, vortioxetine is likely to be similar in efficacy to other analysed antidepressants [citalopram, sertraline, escitalopram and venlafaxine extended release (XR)], and may be more efficacious than agomelatine and inferior to duloxetine. The ERG concluded that vortioxetine may be more tolerable than other analysed antidepressants (sertraline, venlafaxine XR and bupropion), although the limited data prevent firm conclusions. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vortioxetine reported by the manufacturer was £378 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with venlafaxine. Given considerable concerns about the indirect treatment comparison undertaken by the manufacturer, the use of only a restrictive subset of the available evidence, and concerns regarding comparators and structural model assumptions, the ERG believes that this is not a valid estimate of the cost effectiveness of vortioxetine. Following corrections made to the model made by the ERG, the estimated cost effectiveness of vortioxetine was sensitive to the source of evidence used, in addition to whether certain comparators were excluded. The NICE thus asked the manufacturer to provide a revised economic model, which incorporated the broader evidence base and considered the cost effectiveness of vortioxetine as a third-line treatment. Assuming equal efficacy, vortioxetine was shown to be less costly and generate a higher QALY gain than relevant comparators at the third-line of treatment owing to its tolerability and adverse event profile. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended vortioxetine as an option for treating MDEs in adults whose condition has responded inadequately to two antidepressants within the current episode.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Intersting to read a critic of a published indirect comparison by a manufacturer""]}",27289476,

No randomized trial has compared these treatments head-to-head. We compared efficacy outcomes between patients receiving ceritinib and an external control group receiving crizotinib, both as initial ALK-targeted therapies for previously treated advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC. METHODS: Individual patient data for the ceritinib-treated patients were drawn from two single-arm trials (ASCEND-1 and ASCEND-3); published summary data for the crizotinib-treated patients were extracted from three trials (PROFILE 1001, PROFILE 1005, and PROFILE 1007). To adjust for cross-trial differences, average baseline characteristics were matched using propensity score weighting. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate were then compared between treatment groups. RESULTS: Before matching, the ceritinib-treated patients (n = 189) were significantly different from the crizotinib-treated patients (n = 557) in the distribution of race and number of prior regimens. After matching, all available baseline characteristics were balanced. Compared with crizotinib, ceritinib was associated with longer OS (hazard ratio = 0.59, 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.75) and longer PFS (median 13.8 versus 8.3 months, hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% confidence interval: 0.44-0.62) in Cox proportional hazards models. The 12-month OS was 82.6% with ceritinib and 66.0% with crizotinib in a Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in overall response rate between ceritinib and crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: In an adjusted comparison across separate clinical trials, ceritinib was associated with prolonged OS and PFS compared with crizotinib when used as initial ALK-targeted therapy for previously treated ALK-positive NSCLC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",27288979,

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents the ERG's critical review of the evidence presented in the company submission in the context of a description of the company submission, and the resulting NICE guidance. The main clinical effectiveness data for daclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir (daclatasvir + sofosbuvir) were derived from two uncontrolled open-label trials. Among patients with genotype 1 infection, 98-100 % of patients had a sustained virologic response at week 12 (SVR12), overall. Among genotype 3 patients, between 85 and 100 % had SVR12 across patient populations and regimens. The main evidence for daclatasvir + pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (PR) came from one randomised controlled trial comparing daclatasvir + PR with PR in patients with genotype 4. This found an SVR12 rate of 82 % in previously untreated patients. Serious adverse event rates associated with daclatasvir were low. The lack of comparative trial evidence for daclatasvir + sofosbuvir and many of the comparators defined in the NICE scope meant that established methods for comparing interventions either directly via head-to-head trial comparisons or via adjusted indirect comparisons were not feasible. Comparisons of SVR rates were therefore largely based on unadjusted estimates drawn from individual trial arms and subgroups of individual trial arms. The ERG concluded that, despite limited evidence, daclatasvir in combination with other treatments appeared to be associated with a high SVR rate. Daclatasvir + sofosbuvir was unlikely to be inferior to comparator treatments in genotype 1 patients; but, due to limited evidence, the relative efficacy of daclatasvir and other treatments in genotype 3 and 4 patients or patients with compensated cirrhosis was uncertain. The economic evaluation compared daclatasvir + sofosbuvir and daclatasvir + PR with a wide range of NICE-approved treatments for hepatitis C. The company submission focused on a series of subgroups defined by disease severity (METAVIR fibrosis stage F3, compensated cirrhosis), genotype and treatment history. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, daclatasvir-containing regimens were cost effective at a £20,000-£30,000 per QALY threshold in the following F3 populations: genotype 1 treatment naïve (Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = £19,739/QALY) and treatment experienced (£15,687/QALY) and genotypes 1, 3 and 4 interferon ineligible or intolerant (£5906-£9607/QALY depending on subgroup). In patients with cirrhosis, daclatasvir-containing regimens were not cost effective. The ERG found the company's economic analyses to be highly uncertain and in places biased. However, the ERG found that daclatasvir-containing regimens were cost effective in certain populations with significant fibrosis, and following new analyses by the company after a price reduction, in certain populations with cirrhosis, including patients who were not eligible for or who were intolerant to interferon therapy. The NICE Appraisal Committee's preliminary recommendation was that daclatasvir + sofosbuvir should be available as an option in genotype 1 and 4 patients with significant fibrosis but without cirrhosis, who had either been treated previously or were ineligible or intolerant to interferon. In response to the preliminary recommendation, the manufacturer submitted additional information including comparator SVR rates and a revised confidential price. Following this, the Committee expanded its original recommendation in its Final Appraisal Determination. The recommendation was expanded to include daclatasvir + sofosbuvir as an option for patients with significant fibrosis but without cirrhosis (in previously untreated patients with genotype 1, and genotype 3 patients ineligible or intolerant to interferon) and genotype 1, 3 and 4 cirrhotic patients who were ineligible or intolerant to interferon. Daclatasvir + PR was also recommended as an option for genotype 4 patients who had significant fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_original_article",27278217,

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether biologic agents affect the risk of infection or malignancy in adults with IBD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov through March 2016 for randomized placebo-controlled or head-to-head trials of biologic agents approved for treatment of adults with IBD (ie, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, infliximab, natalizumab, or vedolizumab). Two reviewers independently extracted study data and outcomes (serious infections, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, any infection, and malignancies) and rated each trial's risk of bias. We used conventional meta-analysis to synthesize direct evidence and a network meta-analysis for adjusted indirect treatment comparisons. RESULTS: We identified 49 randomized placebo-controlled studies comprising 14,590 participants. Synthesis of the evidence indicated that patients treated with biologics had a moderate increase in risk of any infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.29) and a significant increase in risk of opportunistic infections (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.21-3.01). Risk of serious infections was not increased in patients treated with biologics (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71-1.12). On the contrary, biologics appeared to significantly reduce risk of serious infections in studies with low risk of bias (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.90). We did not find an increased risk of malignancy with use of biologic agents (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.54-1.50), but data were insufficient in terms of exposure and follow-up times. None of the indirect comparisons, either among the individual agents or between the anti-tumor necrosis factor and anti-integrin classes, reached significance for any of the outcomes analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a systematic review and meta-analysis, biologic agents increase the risk of opportunistic infections in patients with IBD, but not the risk of serious infections. It is necessary to continue to monitor the comparative and long-term safety profiles of these drugs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",27189910,

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov through June 2015. Randomized controlled trials published in English that compare SGLT2 inhibitor plus insulin (SGLT2i/INS) with placebo plus insulin or DPP4 inhibitor plus insulin (DPP4i/INS) with placebo plus insulin in patients with T2DM were selected. Data on the study characteristics, efficacy and safety outcomes were extracted. We compared the efficacy and safety between SGLT2i/INS and DPP4i/INS indirectly with covariates adjustment. Risk of potential bias was assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen eligible randomized controlled trials comprising 6980 patients were included (five SGLT2 inhibitor studies and nine DPP4 inhibitor studies). Covariate-adjusted indirect comparison using meta-regression analyses revealed that SGLT2i/INS achieved greater reduction in HbA(1c) [weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.24%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.43 to -0.05%], fasting plasma glucose (WMD -18.0 mg/dL, 95% CI -28.5 to -7.6 mg/dL) and body weight (WMD -2.38 kg, 95% CI -3.18 to -1.58 kg) from baseline than DPP4i/INS without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia (relative risks 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.82). CONCLUSIONS: Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors achieved better glycaemic control and greater weight reduction than DPP4 inhibitors without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with T2DM that is inadequately controlled with insulin. There has been no direct comparison of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with insulin therapy. In this study, we performed indirect meta-analysis comparing SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors added to insulin therapy. Without increasing hypoglycaemia, SGLT2 inhibitors showed better glycaemic control and greater weight reduction than DPP4 inhibitors in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with insulin. The results of the current study could serve as the best available evidence in selecting oral agents to improve glycaemic control in insulin-treated T2DM patients.

Subsequent joint damage can lead to disability and growth restriction. Treatment commonly includes disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate. Clinical practice now favours newer drugs termed biologic DMARDs where indicated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of four biologic DMARDs [etanercept (Enbrel(®), Pfizer), abatacept (Orencia(®), Bristol-Myers Squibb), adalimumab (Humira(®), AbbVie) and tocilizumab (RoActemra(®), Roche) - with or without methotrexate where indicated] for the treatment of JIA (systemic or oligoarticular JIA are excluded). DATA SOURCES: Electronic bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched for published studies from inception to May 2015 for English-language articles. Bibliographies of related papers, systematic reviews and company submissions were screened and experts were contacted to identify additional evidence. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness were undertaken in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. A cost-utility decision-analytic model was developed to compare the estimated cost-effectiveness of biologic DMARDs versus methotrexate. The base-case time horizon was 30 years and the model took a NHS perspective, with costs and benefits discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: Four placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria for the clinical effectiveness review (one RCT evaluating each biologic DMARD). Only one RCT included UK participants. Participants had to achieve an American College of Rheumatology Pediatric (ACR Pedi)-30 response to open-label lead-in treatment in order to be randomised. An exploratory adjusted indirect comparison suggests that the four biologic DMARDs are similar, with fewer disease flares and greater proportions of ACR Pedi-50 and -70 responses among participants randomised to continued biologic DMARDs. However, confidence intervals were wide, the number of trials was low and there was clinical heterogeneity between trials. Open-label extensions of the trials showed that, generally, ACR responses remained constant or even increased after the double-blind phase. The proportions of adverse events and serious adverse events were generally similar between the treatment and placebo groups. Four economic evaluations of biologic DMARDs for patients with JIA were identified but all had limitations. Two quality-of-life studies were included, one of which informed the cost-utility model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for adalimumab, etanercept and tocilizumab versus methotrexate were £38,127, £32,526 and £38,656 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. The ICER for abatacept versus methotrexate as a second-line biologic was £39,536 per QALY. LIMITATIONS: The model does not incorporate the natural history of JIA in terms of long-term disease progression, as the current evidence is limited. There are no head-to-head trials of biologic DMARDs, and clinical evidence for specific JIA subtypes is limited. CONCLUSIONS: Biologic DMARDs are superior to placebo (with methotrexate where permitted) in children with (predominantly) polyarticular course JIA who have had an insufficient response to previous treatment. Randomised comparisons of biologic DMARDs with long-term efficacy and safety follow-up are needed to establish comparative effectiveness. RCTs for JIA subtypes for which evidence is lacking are also required. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42015016459.

Although IPD indirect comparisons are published with increasing frequency in health care literature, there is no guidance on selecting the appropriate methodology and on reporting the methods and results. METHODS: In this paper we examine the methods and reporting of indirect comparison methods using IPD. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from inception until October 2014. We included published and unpublished studies reporting a method, application, or review of indirect comparisons using IPD and at least three interventions. RESULTS: We identified 37 papers, including a total of 33 empirical networks. Of these, only 9 (27 %) IPD-NMAs reported the existence of a study protocol, whereas 3 (9 %) studies mentioned that protocols existed without providing a reference. The 33 empirical networks included 24 (73 %) IPD-NMAs and 9 (27 %) matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs). Of the 21 (64 %) networks with at least one closed loop, 19 (90 %) were IPD-NMAs, 13 (68 %) of which evaluated the prerequisite consistency assumption, and only 5 (38 %) of the 13 IPD-NMAs used statistical approaches. The median number of trials included per network was 10 (IQR 4-19) (IPD-NMA: 15 [IQR 8-20]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 3-5]), and the median number of IPD trials included in a network was 3 (IQR 1-9) (IPD-NMA: 6 [IQR 2-11]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 1-2]). Half of the networks (17; 52 %) applied Bayesian hierarchical models (14 one-stage, 1 two-stage, 1 used IPD as an informative prior, 1 unclear-stage), including either IPD alone or with aggregated data (AD). Models for dichotomous and continuous outcomes were available (IPD alone or combined with AD), as were models for time-to-event data (IPD combined with AD). CONCLUSIONS: One in three indirect comparison methods modeling IPD adjusted results from different trials to estimate effects as if they had come from the same, randomized, population. Key methodological and reporting elements (e.g., evaluation of consistency, existence of study protocol) were often missing from an indirect comparison paper.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,no_paitc",27116943,PMC4847203

The outcome of melanoma depends on its stage at diagnosis. Currently, for patients with advanced melanoma, two MEK inhibitors (trametinib and cobimetinib) have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency. The main objective of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of trametinib-dabrafenib and cobimetinib-vemurafenib in patients with advanced melanoma through adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs). METHODS: A search was made up to the 3rd of November 2015. Databases consulted were MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the efficacy of trametinib-dabrafenib or cobimetinib-vemurafenib versus a common treatment comparator, in which outcomes of overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) were considered. ITCs were carried out using the method proposed by Bucher et al. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Two RCTs were included (one for each drugs combination). The results of the adjusted ITCs showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the two combinations in terms of PFS and ORR. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The ITCs indicate no difference in efficacy between both treatments. However, there should be an independent, head-to-head trial of both combinations to confirm the results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",27079278,

We sought to examine the relative treatment effect of talimogene laherparepvec compared with ipilimumab and vemurafenib. METHODS: A systematic literature review of treatments for metastatic melanoma was undertaken but a valid network of evidence could not be established because of a lack of comparative data or studies with sufficient common comparators. A conventional adjusted indirect treatment comparison via network meta-analysis was, therefore, not feasible. Instead, a meta-analysis of absolute efficacy was undertaken, adjusting overall survival (OS) data for differences in prognostic factors between studies using a published algorithm. RESULTS: Four trials were included in the final indirect treatment comparison: two of ipilimumab, one of vemurafenib, and one of talimogene laherparepvec. Median OS for ipilimumab and vemurafenib increased significantly when adjustment was applied, demonstrating that variation in disease and patient characteristics was biasing OS estimates; adjusting for this made the survival data more comparable. For both ipilimumab and vemurafenib, the adjustments improved Kaplan-Meier OS curves; the observed talimogene laherparepvec OS curve remained above the adjusted OS curves for ipilimumab and vemurafenib, showing that long-term survival could differ from the observed medians. CONCLUSION: Even with limited data, talimogene laherparepvec, ipilimumab, and vemurafenib could be compared following adjustments, thereby providing a more reliable understanding of the relative effect of treatment on survival in a more comparable patient population. The results of this analysis suggest that OS with talimogene laherparepvec is at least as good as with ipilimumab and vemurafenib and improvement was more pronounced in patients with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral metastases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hazard ratios (HRs) were obtained by modeling OS data with the Weibull distribution. A fixed-effect Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted. The evidence network included anastrozole 1 mg, letrozole 2.5 mg, fulvestrant 250 mg, exemestane 25 mg, megestrol acetate 40 mg, and everolimus 10 mg plus exemestane 25 mg as comparators. Post-antiestrogen and post-aromatase inhibitor subgroup networks were analyzed. RESULTS: In the overall analysis, the HRs suggested improved OS for fulvestrant 500 mg versus fulvestrant 250 mg and megestrol acetate 40 mg, and numerically favorable differences with fulvestrant 500 mg versus other comparators. In the antiestrogen subgroup, the HRs suggested improved OS for fulvestrant 500 mg versus fulvestrant 250 mg and megestrol acetate 40 mg; numerical differences in the HRs were seen versus anastrozole 1 mg and letrozole 2.5 mg. In the aromatase inhibitor subgroup, the HRs for OS numerically favored fulvestrant 500 mg versus fulvestrant 250 mg and exemestane 25 mg. CONCLUSION: Acknowledging the limitations of the present network meta-analysis, these findings suggest that fulvestrant 500 mg might provide improved OS versus fulvestrant 250 mg and megestrol acetate 40 mg for treatment of estrogen receptor-positive ABC following endocrine therapy failure. Although OS efficacy versus everolimus 10 mg plus exemestane 25 mg (for overall evidence network), anastrozole 1 mg, exemestane 25 mg, and letrozole 2.5 mg is numerically favorable, additional studies are required to draw formal conclusions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26971303,

Yet direct comparative trials between these agents in prevention of acute limb ischemia (ALI) are unavailable so far. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis between direct oral agents for prevention of acute limb ischemia in atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review searching electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase) and the Cochrane Library from January 1990 through November 2014. Two blinded investigators reviewed all potentially relevant articles in a parallel manner by using a priori defined criteria. To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of these agents, only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with follow-up durations of >1 year were included. The primary efficacy outcome was the end point of acute limb ischemia and/or extremity embolism. RESULTS: A total of 44,563 patients from three RCTs met criteria for inclusion. Patients randomized to direct oral anticoagulants had a non-significant decreased risk for acute limb ischemia (risk ratio [RR]: 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-1.2). In the analysis between agents, however, rivaroxaban significantly lowered the risk of ALI compared to warfarin (RR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.064-0.82), apixaban (RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.081-0.83), and dabigatran (RR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.077-0.83).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project was to summarise the evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the MiniMed(®) Paradigm™ Veo system (Medtronic Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) and the Vibe™ (Animas(®) Corporation, West Chester, PA, USA) and G4(®) PLATINUM CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) system (Dexcom Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) in comparison with multiple daily insulin injections (MDIs) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), both with either self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) or CGM, for the management of T1DM in adults and children. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidance and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Diagnostic Assessment Programme manual. We searched 14 databases, three trial registries and two conference proceedings from study inception up to September 2014. In addition, reference lists of relevant systematic reviews were checked. In the absence of randomised controlled trials directly comparing Veo or an integrated CSII + CGM system, such as Vibe, with comparator interventions, indirect treatment comparisons were performed if possible. METHODS: A commercially available cost-effectiveness model, the IMS Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness diabetes model version 8.5 (IMS Health, Danbury, CT, USA), was used for this assessment. This model is an internet-based, interactive simulation model that predicts the long-term health outcomes and costs associated with the management of T1DM and type 2 diabetes. The model consists of 15 submodels designed to simulate diabetes-related complications, non-specific mortality and costs over time. As the model simulates individual patients over time, it updates risk factors and complications to account for disease progression. RESULTS: Fifty-four publications resulting from 19 studies were included in the review. Overall, the evidence suggests that the Veo system reduces hypoglycaemic events more than other treatments, without any differences in other outcomes, including glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. We also found significant results in favour of the integrated CSII + CGM system over MDIs with SMBG with regard to HbA1c levels and quality of life. However, the evidence base was poor. The quality of the included studies was generally low, often with only one study comparing treatments in a specific population at a specific follow-up time. In particular, there was only one study comparing Veo with an integrated CSII + CGM system and only one study comparing Veo with a CSII + SMBG system in a mixed population. Cost-effectiveness analyses indicated that MDI + SMBG is the option most likely to be cost-effective, given the current threshold of £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, whereas integrated CSII + CGM systems and Veo are dominated and extendedly dominated, respectively, by stand-alone, non-integrated CSII with CGM. Scenario analyses did not alter these conclusions. No cost-effectiveness modelling was conducted for children or pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: The Veo system does appear to be better than the other systems considered at reducing hypoglycaemic events. However, in adults, it is unlikely to be cost-effective. Integrated systems are also generally unlikely to be cost-effective given that stand-alone systems are cheaper and, possibly, no less effective. However, evidence in this regard is generally lacking, in particular for children. Future trials in specific child, adolescent and adult populations should include longer term follow-up and ratings on the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions scale at various time points with a view to informing improved cost-effectiveness modelling.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative efficacy of mirabegron and onabotulinumtoxinA in patients with idiopathic OAB. DESIGN: Network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: A search of 9 electronic databases, review documents, guidelines and websites. METHODS: Randomised trials comparing any licensed dose of onabotulinumtoxinA or mirabegron with each other, anticholinergic drugs or placebo were eligible (19 randomised trials were identified). 1 reviewer extracted data from the studies and a second reviewer checked the data. Candidate trials were assessed for similarity and networks were developed for each outcome. Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using both fixed-effects and random-effects models. When there were differences in mean baseline values between mirabegron and onabotulinumtoxinA trials they were adjusted for using network meta-regression (NMR). RESULTS: No studies directly comparing onabotulinumtoxinA to mirabegron were identified. A network was created for each of the 7 outcomes, with 3-9 studies included in each individual network. The trials included in the networks were broadly similar. Patients in the onabotulinumtoxinA trials had more urinary incontinence and urgency episodes at baseline than patients in the mirabegron trials and these differences were adjusted for using NMR. Both onabotulinumtoxinA and mirabegron were more efficacious than placebo at reducing the frequency of urinary incontinence, urgency, urination and nocturia. OnabotulinumtoxinA was more efficacious than mirabegron (50 and 25 mg) in completely resolving daily episodes of urinary incontinence and urgency and in reducing the frequency of urinary incontinence, urgency and urination. NMR supported the results of the network meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head trials comparing onabotulinumtoxinA to mirabegron, this indirect comparison indicates that onabotulinumtoxinA may be superior to mirabegron in improving symptoms of urinary incontinence, urgency and urinary frequency in patients with idiopathic OAB.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26908514,PMC4769403

This study aimed to compare a currently recommended immunosuppressive treatment, tacrolimus, against a newer treatment, belatacept, using indirect treatment comparison (ITC) techniques since no head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tacrolimus against belatacept currently exist. METHODS: ITC was employed to calculate estimates for the relative risks and mean difference of tacrolimus against belatacept. The choice of the Bucher ITC model was driven by the available data and the simple indirect treatment comparison involving three treatments was considered appropriate. RESULTS: The results of the indirect analysis showed no significant differences between belatacept and tacrolimus treatments for mortality and graft loss. The acute rejection rate was significantly lower with tacrolimus (Prograf* and Advagraf (*) ) compared with belatacept (0.22 [0.13, 0.39] to 0.44 [0.20, 0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that tacrolimus is significantly superior to belatacept in terms of acute rejection outcomes but comparable for graft and patient survival. Further research should include a properly designed clinical trial comparing tacrolimus against belatacept directly. LIMITATIONS: These include variations in terms of clinical and design differences among the trials, weaknesses in the Bucher method and the lack of long-term clinical trial data with tacrolimus to compare with the recent long-term (7 years) belatacept trial data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26907083,

A systematic review was conducted to assess the clinical efficacy, safety and effect of all first-line treatments evaluated to date on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A systematic search of Embase, Cochrane and MEDLINE databases was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (1980-2015) evaluating any targeted therapy/immunotherapy against placebo or any other targeted intervention/immunotherapy in treatment-naive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Conference proceedings from major cancer congresses (2007-2015) were handsearched. Sixteen randomized controlled trials were identified, mostly phase III. Overall, targeted therapies were associated with either improved [sunitinib, bevacizumab+interferon α (IFNα) and temsirolimus] or comparable (sorafenib) progression-free survival (PFS) versus IFNα monotherapy. Sunitinib demonstrated comparable PFS and overall survival to pazopanib, comparable PFS to sorafenib and shorter PFS compared with bevacizumab+IFNα (although no conclusions were made with regard to superiority/inferiority). Compared with sorafenib, tivozanib demonstrated a significantly longer PFS, and both tivozanib and axitinib demonstrated higher response rates. Nintedanib demonstrated comparable PFS and overall survival to sunitinib in a phase II trial. Temsirolimus, sunitinib and sorafenib treatment led to better HRQoL versus IFNα; pazopanib was associated with better HRQoL versus sunitinib. No direct meta-analyses or indirect treatment comparison analysis were undertaken because of noncomparability of the trials. In general, targeted therapies demonstrated favourable clinical efficacy and improved HRQoL compared with IFNα monotherapy.

METHODS: A systematic literature review performed in March 2014, using a predefined search strategy in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library, identified 17 randomized placebo-controlled trials, (tiotropium n = 15; aclidinium/formoterol n = 2). Outcomes of interest were: bronchodilation (peak and trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)), COPD symptoms [Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score and % of responders (>1 unit improvement)] and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) [St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and % responders (>4 unit improvement)], % of patients with ≥1 exacerbations, adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), hospitalization and mortality, all at 24 weeks. In the absence of head-to-head trials between aclidinium/formoterol and tiotropium, a Bayesian indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was used with placebo as common control. RESULTS: Regarding bronchodilation, aclidinium/formoterol was found to be more efficacious than tiotropium at peak FEV1, with mean difference in change from baseline (DCFB) 143 mL [95% credible interval (CrI): 112, 174] and at trough FEV1 [DCFB 26 mL (95% CrI -2, 55)]. Aclidinium/formoterol is expected to be more efficacious than tiotropium in improving dyspnea symptoms measured by TDI [DCFB 0.54 points (95% CrI 0.09, 0.99); odds ratio (OR) of responders 1.51 (95% CrI 1.11, 2.06)].

They can also be extended to study comparative effectiveness, testing which of several alternative interventions is expected to have the strongest effect. This often requires network meta-analysis (NMA), which combines trials involving direct comparison of two interventions within the same trial and indirect comparisons across trials. In this paper, we extend existing network methods for main effects to examining moderator effects, allowing for tests of whether intervention effects vary for different populations or when employed in different contexts. In addition, we study how the use of individual participant data may increase the sensitivity of NMA for detecting moderator effects, as compared with aggregate data NMA that employs study-level effect sizes in a meta-regression framework. A new NMA diagram is proposed. We also develop a generalized multilevel model for NMA that takes into account within-trial and between-trial heterogeneity and can include participant-level covariates. Within this framework, we present definitions of homogeneity and consistency across trials. A simulation study based on this model is used to assess effects on power to detect both main and moderator effects. Results show that power to detect moderation is substantially greater when applied to individual participant data as compared with study-level effects. We illustrate the use of this method by applying it to data from a classroom-based randomized study that involved two sub-trials, each comparing interventions that were contrasted with separate control groups.

Sustained virologic response at week 12 post-treatment (SVR12) discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) and rates of AEs were compared. FINDINGS: The SVR12 rate was significantly higher among patients treated with DCV+SOF (n = 91) than among those treated with SOF+R (n = 455) both before (96.7% vs 84.6%; P = 0.002) and after (99.9% vs 84.6%; P < 0.001) adjusting for baseline characteristics. After adjustment, compared with patients treated with SOF+R, patients receiving DCV+SOF had a significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to AEs and significantly lower rates of the following specific AEs: cough, diarrhea, insomnia, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and hemoglobin <10 g/dL. IMPLICATIONS: After adjustment for cross-trial differences in baseline characteristics, DCV+SOF was associated with a significantly higher SVR12 rate and lower rate of discontinuation due to AEs than SOF+R in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",26839044,

Recently, nintedanib and pirfenidone demonstrated efficacy in slowing disease progression and were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Although numerous treatments have been evaluated in IPF, none have shown significant decreases in mortality. The objective of this study was to identify all pharmacologic treatments evaluated for IPF and analyze their efficacy via Bayesian network meta-analysis and pairwise indirect treatment comparisons. This review did not evaluate the effect of steroid therapy. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published on or before August 2014. Studies were required to contain a randomized evaluation of nonsteroidal drug therapy for treatment of IPF and be published in English. Key outcomes of interest for this analysis were pulmonary function as measured by FVC as well as all-cause and respiratory-specific death. All outcomes were analyzed via a Bayesian framework. RESULTS: Our review identified 30 eligible studies that evaluated 16 unique treatments. Under both the fixed-effect and random-effect models for respiratory-specific mortality, no treatments performed better than placebo. For all-cause mortality, pirfenidone and nintedanib had effects approaching significance with credible intervals slightly crossing the null under a fixed-effect model. Notably, for respiratory-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, and decline in percent predicted FVC, nintedanib and pirfenidone were virtually indistinguishable and no clear advantage was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Although two treatments have been approved for IPF on the basis of reduced decline in pulmonary function, neither one has a clear advantage on mortality outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26836914,

Methods Individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed for treatment lines composing four treatment sequences. Parametric models were tested to select the model that best fits the IPD. The transitional probability equations, used for disease progression modeling, were obtained by substituting the parameters of the general equation for transitional probabilities by the parameters estimated from fitted distributions. Results The log-logistic model best fitted the reconstructed data for progression-free and overall survival curves for each line of treatment. The shapes and scales of the log-logistic models were used to develop the transitional probability equations for the HER2+ mBC simulation model. KEY LIMITATIONS: The estimation of the transitional probabilities depends heavily on the accuracy of the IPD reconstruction. Nonetheless, analytical and graphical tests can be performed to check the face validity of the reconstructed data. Additionally, sensitivity analyses can be conducted to test the impact of uncertainty surrounding the estimated parameters defining equations for transitional probabilities. Conclusion The results of this study can be used as input in model-based economic evaluations of sequential therapy for HER2+ mBC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",26824145,PMC4959115

A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials comparing noninvasive weaning at spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure after meeting simple weaning criteria or at the pulmonary infection control window (PIC window) with conventional invasive weaning in COPD patients. Using conventional invasive weaning as a bridge, we indirectly compared the two noninvasive weaning strategies using the Bucher approach. Noninvasive weaning at SBT failure after meeting simple weaning criteria was associated with an extended duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation (standardized mean difference 1.90, 95% CI 1.27-2.53, P < 0.001) compared with noninvasive weaning at the PIC window. No significant differences in mortality or the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia were observed. Our study suggests that the PIC window may be a promising switching time for noninvasive weaning in COPD patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26804561,

Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalization and hospitalization for worsening HF. METHODS: We conducted a search of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases until 31st December 2014 for randomized control trials (RCTs) in HF evaluating statins versus placebo. Identified RCTs and their respective abstracted information were grouped according to statin type evaluated and analyzed separately. Outcomes were initially pooled with the Peto's one-step method, producing odd ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for each statin type. Using these pooled estimates, we performed adjusted indirect comparisons of lipophilic versus hydrophilic statin for each outcome. RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 10,966 patients were identified and analyzed. Lipophilic statins were superior to hydrophilic rosuvastatin regarding all-cause mortality (OR 0 · 50; 95 % CI, 0 · 11-0 · 89; p = 0 · 01), cardiovascular mortality (OR 0 · 61; 0 · 25-0 · 97; p = 0 · 009), and hospitalization for worsening HF (OR 0 · 52; 0 · 21-0 · 83; p = 0 · 0005). However, both statins were comparable with regards to cardiovascular hospitalization [OR 0 · 80 (0 · 31, 1 · 28); p = 0 · 36]. CONCLUSIONS: Lipophilic statin treatment shows significant decreases in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for worsening HF compared with rosuvastatin treatment. This meta-analysis provides preliminary evidence that lipophilic statins offer better clinical outcomes in HF till data from head to head comparisons are available.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26780905,

To date, little research has been conducted on the treatment effect in different subgroups of patients with AD. The aim of this study is to examine the comparative effectiveness and safety of cognitive enhancers for different patient characteristics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will update our previous literature search from January 2015 forward, using the same terms and electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE) from our previous review. We will additionally search grey literature and scan the reference lists of the included studies. Randomised clinical trials of any duration conducted at any time comparing cognitive enhancers alone or in any combination against other cognitive enhancers, or placebo in adults with AD will be eligible. The outcomes of interest are cognition according to the Mini-Mental State Examination, and overall serious adverse events. For each outcome and treatment comparison, we will perform a Bayesian hierarchical random-effects meta-analysis combining the individual patient data (IPD) from each eligible study. If the identified treatment comparisons form a connected network diagram, we will perform an IPD network meta-analysis (NMA) to estimate subgroup effects for patients with different characteristics, such as AD severity and sex. We will combine aggregated data from studies that we will not be able to obtain IPD, with the IPD provided by the original authors, in a single model. We will use the PRISMA-IPD and PRISMA-NMA statements to report our findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings of this study will be of interest to stakeholders, including decision makers, guideline developers, clinicians, methodologists and patients, and they will help to improve guidelines for the management of patients with AD.

To further clarify the clinical position of SOX in advanced gastric cancer (AGC), a meta-analysis including information from other reported studies was conducted. METHODS: In addition to G-SOX, Japanese phase III clinical trials including S-1 monotherapy were included in the analyses. Individual patient data for SOX (318 patients) and CS (324 patients) from G-SOX, as well as those for S-1 (160 patients) from the Randomized Phase III Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Irinotecan plus S-1 with S-1 Alone as First-line Treatment for Advanced Gastric Cancer (GC0301/TOP-002), were available. Published clinical information for S-1 from other studies (total 705 patients) was also collected. A Weibull distribution was assumed for overall survival time, and parameters for SOX, CS, and S-1 were estimated parametrically. Posterior HR distributions were obtained with a Bayesian approach. RESULTS: The HR of SOX to S-1 was 0.817 (95 % credible interval 0.704-0.939), and the probability of the HR <1.00 was 99.8 %.

In a randomized head-to-head trial, liraglutide 1.8 mg q.d. led to greater reductions in HbA1c than exenatide 10 μg b.i.d. There are no direct comparisons of liraglutide 1.2 mg q.d. and exenatide b.i.d.; therefore, in the present study, an indirect comparison and meta-analysis were undertaken. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for randomized controlled trials of liraglutide 1.2 mg q.d. or exenatide b.i.d. with HbA1c as an outcome and ≥25 subjects. Key data were extracted and analyzed. A random-effects model was used to incorporate heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: Three liraglutide 1.2 mg q.d. (n = 1060) and 10 exenatide b.i.d. (n = 2609) placebo-controlled studies were identified, allowing indirect comparison with placebo as the common arm. Baseline characteristics were mean age ~55 years, disease duration ~7 years, HbA1c ~8%, and body mass index ~32 kg/m(2) . Compared with exenatide b.i.d., liraglutide 1.2 mg was associated with significantly greater reductions from baseline in HbA1c (-0.29%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.53, -0.05) and fasting plasma glucose (-0.92 mmol/L; 95% CI -1.43, -0.41), with shorter duration of nausea (3 vs 14 days; P = 0.002) and fewer withdrawals (odds ratio 0.34; 95% CI 0.22, 0.52). The incidence of adverse events (including nausea) and withdrawals because of adverse events were similar between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide 1.2 mg provided a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c than exenatide 10 μg b.i.d.

Currently, there is a lack of high quality evidence to support the tailoring of insulin regimens according to an individual's needs. The aim of this study is to update our previous systematic review and perform an individual patient data network meta-analysis (IPD-NMA) to evaluate the comparative safety and effectiveness of long-acting versus intermediate-acting insulin in different subgroups of patients with T1DM. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will update our previous literature search from January 2013 onwards searching relevant electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE), as well as perform grey literature search through relevant society/association websites, and conference abstracts, and scan reference lists of the eligible studies. We will include randomised clinical trials of any duration examining long-acting versus intermediate-acting insulin preparations for adult patients with T1DM. We will focus on A1C and severe hypoglycaemia outcomes. For each pairwise treatment comparison, we will combine all IPD from all studies in a single multilevel model, where each study is a different cluster.

METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for monotherapy studies in patients with MDD with inadequate response to first-line therapy. Treatments included SSRIs, SNRIs, and other antidepressants. Identified studies underwent a three-stage screening/data extraction process and critical appraisal. Adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) on systematic literature review outputs were made using Bucher's method, comparing remission rates and withdrawal rates due to adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Of 27 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, a few studies were of high quality according to the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence checklist. Three studies contributed to an evidence network for quantitative assessment comparing vortioxetine with agomelatine, sertraline, venlafaxine XR, and bupropion SR. Vortioxetine had a statistically significantly higher remission rate than agomelatine (risk difference [RD]: -11.0% [95% CI: -19.4; -2.6]), and numerically higher remission rates than sertraline (RD: -14.4% [95% CI: -29.9; 1.1]), venlafaxine (RD: -7.20% [95% CI: -24.3; 9.9]), and bupropion (RD: -10.70% [95% CI: -27.8; 6.4]). Withdrawal rates due to AEs were statistically significantly lower for vortioxetine than sertraline (RD: 12.1% [95% CI: 3.1; 21.1]), venlafaxine XR (RD: 12.3% [95% CI: 0.8; 23.8]), and bupropion SR (RD: 18.3% [95% CI: 6.4; 30.1]). CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic literature review found a few high quality switch studies assessing monotherapies in patients with MDD with inadequate response to SSRI/SNRIs. ITCs indicated that switching to vortioxetine leads to numerically higher remission rates compared with other antidepressants. Vortioxetine is a well tolerated treatment, showing statistically lower withdrawal rates due to AEs compared with other antidepressants. Vortioxetine is a relevant therapeutic alternative in patients experiencing inadequate response to prior SSRI or SNRI therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26637048,

METHODS: Individual patient data from the RECORD-1 (Renal Cell Cancer Treatment With Oral RAD001 Given Daily) Phase III clinical trial provided information for patients taking everolimus. Summary baseline clinical and demographic characteristics and progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes were available for patients taking axitinib who were included in the AXIS (axitinib versus sorafenib) Phase III clinical trial. A Bayesian latent class mixture model differentiating responders and nonresponders and with imbedded Weibull regression on PFS was used to identify sex, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk score, and time receiving prior sunitinib therapy as prognostic factors for PFS based on posterior probability >95%. Patients taking everolimus were weighted up or down based on their combination of prognostic variables. Weights were calculated by dividing the proportion of patients observed in AXIS for a given characteristic by the proportion observed in RECORD-1 and taking the product of the values derived for all three weighting variables considered. Weighted PFS distributions were derived with bootstrapped 95% CIs and compared with those reported for the AXIS trial. FINDINGS: After weighting, distributions of the 3 key baseline characteristics were more closely aligned between the 2 studies; however, some differences remained. A slightly lower rate of poor-risk patients was evident in RECORD-1 (30%) versus AXIS (36%), and a 9% lower proportion of males was observed in the everolimus group compared with the axitinib group. Distributions of time receiving prior sunitinib therapy were almost equivalent between the treatment arms. A median PFS of 4.7 months (95% CI, 3.5-10.6 months) was observed for patients in the weighted everolimus group compared with 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.5-6.4 months) in the AXIS trial. IMPLICATIONS: Similar median PFS point estimates and overlapping CIs suggest that everolimus and axitinib have similar efficacy. Although these results do not negate the need for direct comparison, this study may be used to inform clinical and reimbursement decisions until such evidence is available.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read,FULL_ARTICLE | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Seem like they are doing population adjusted indirect comparison, but not exactly MAIC or STC, so very intersting to read"", ""PAITC, similar to MAIC, but the model used to compute weights is something like a bayesian latent class model""]}",26602976,

Effective treatment is a significant economic burden on the Italian healthcare system. Economic models in RA are commonly based on indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of abatacept relative to adalimumab for RA in Italy based on a head-to-head trial by means of a cost-consequence analysis. RESULTS: Health benefits based on the most stringent efficacy criteria were in favor of abatacept compared to adalimumab. Rates for more costly adverse events were higher for adalimumab compared to abatacept, which was reflected in the lower costs for abatacept (-€237,246 or -€237per patient). CONCLUSION: The health economic value of abatacept compared with adalimumab from the perspective of the Italian NHS depends on the choice of health outcome. Health gains with abatacept were generally based on more stringent criteria and lower total costs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",26495961,

METHODS: A previously developed and validated Markov model was adapted to evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic impact of apixaban 5 mg BID versus edoxaban (high and low dose) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. A pairwise indirect treatment comparison was conducted for clinical end points, and price parity was assumed between apixaban and edoxaban. Costs in 2012 British pounds, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, discounted at 3.5% per annum, were estimated. FINDINGS: Apixaban was predicted to increase life expectancy and QALYs versus low- and high-dose edoxaban. These gains were achieved at cost-savings versus low-dose edoxaban, thus being dominant and nominal increases in costs versus high-dose edoxaban. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of apixaban versus high-dose edoxaban was £6763 per QALY gained. IMPLICATIONS: Apixaban was deemed to be dominant (less costly and more effective) versus low-dose edoxaban and a cost-effective alternative to high-dose edoxaban.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26477648,

The use of matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) in this situation has been suggested. We present the results of a MAIC used to evaluate the incremental benefit offered by adding simeprevir (SMV) to standard therapy in the treatment of patients infected with genotype 4 hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: Individual patient data for a single arm study evaluating the use of SMV with peginterferon alfa 2a + ribavirin (PR) in genotype 4 HCV were available (RESTORE study). A systematic literature review was used to identify studies of PR alone used in the same patient group. By applying the inclusion criteria for each study in turn to the RESTORE dataset and then applying the published MAIC covariate matching algorithm, a series of pseudosamples from RESTORE were generated. After assessment of the matching outcomes, the best matched comparisons were used to derive estimates of efficacy for SMV + PR in patients equivalent to those participating in the PR trial. RESULTS: Five potential comparator studies were identified. After applying the matching process, two emerged as offering the greatest equivalence with the generated RESTORE pseudosamples and were used to estimate SMV + PR efficacy, expressed as the percentage of patients achieving sustained viral response (SVR). In one comparison, SVR in the SMV + PR group was 85% versus 63% for PR alone. In the second comparison, the corresponding SVRs were 77% and 44% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After matching for varying baseline characteristics, both comparisons of RESTORE versus studies of PR alone yielded a benefit for SMV + PR vs PR alone in genotype 4 HCV-infected patients. The incremental gain in SVR associated with use of SMV ranged from 22% to 33%. In the absence of direct comparative studies, the MAIC gives a better perspective than simple comparison of absolute SVR from individual studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",26455472,

In the dossier on vortioxetine for the assessment of the acute treatment of patients with moderate and severe major depressive episodes, the pharmaceutical company (hereinafter referred as “the company”) had presented an adjusted indirect comparison in comparison with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram using a common comparator placebo. The dossier assessment on vortioxetine showed that the results presented by the company were unsuitable for the assessment of the added benefit of vortioxetine. This was largely due to the fact that the company made an inadequate limitation of the study pool for the meta-analyses of the indirect comparison and did not consider the available evidence completely. In its comment, the company submitted supplementary analyses on the indirect comparison, which went beyond the information provided in the dossier. Moreover, the company in its comments referred to a study of direct comparison of vortioxetine versus the SSRI escitalopram (study 318), which the company had not included in the dossier for the assessment of the added benefit. The G-BA commissioned IQWiG with the assessment of the additional data on the indirect comparison and of study 318.

They differ with respect to several factors including estradiol concentration and surface application, and cannot be compared solely on the basis of their estradiol dose. No randomized clinical trials have compared them head to head, but both have been compared with placebo. Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis of the two estradiol gels. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive systematic literature review. One publication reporting on one Divigel trial, three publications reporting on two Estrogel trials, and five publications reporting on other estradiol transdermal preparations were identified. Efficacy outcomes were change from baseline in daily hot flush frequency and change from baseline in daily hot flush severity. Safety outcomes were frequency of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and frequency of treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation. Bayesian indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis of trial-level data was performed in accordance with the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, National Pharmaceutical Council (ISPOR-AMCP-NPC) Good Practice Questionnaire. All outcomes were compared with respect to doses of the considered preparations. RESULTS: For hot flush frequency, Divigel 0.25 mg was similar to Divigel 0.5 mg and to Estrogel 0.75 mg, and was statistically significantly superior to Estrogel 1.5 mg. The largest effect was observed with Divigel 1.0 mg (mean difference of 3.91 hot flushes/wk vs placebo), and was statistically significantly superior to all other interventions. The 1.5 mg Estrogel dose was associated with the smallest estimate of efficacy. For hot flush severity, Divigel 0.25 mg was similar to the efficacy of Divigel 0.5 mg, and for 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg of other estradiol gels, but was statistically inferior to Divigel 1.0 mg, Estrogel 0.75 mg, Estrogel 1.5 mg, and the 1.0 and 1.5 mg doses of all other estradiol gels. The estimated efficacy of Divigel 0.5 mg was similar to that of Estrogel 0.75 mg, Estrogel 1.5 mg, and the 0.25 and 0.5 mg doses of other transdermal estradiol preparations. Risks of treatment-related AEs for Divigel 0.25 mg, Divigel 0.5 mg, Estrogel 0.75 mg, and Estrogel 1.5 mg were similar and all were of a slightly higher risk than placebo. Among these, Divigel 1.0 mg, Estrogel 1.5 mg, and other gels 0.5 mg were statistically significantly less safe than placebo. However, for treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation, none of the gels were associated with statistically significantly higher relative risks compared with placebo. In this study, statistically significant refers to the 95% credible intervals used in the Bayesian Network Analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Using network meta-analysis for indirect treatment comparison, we have shown that the efficacy of Divigel 0.25 mg, as measured by reduced hot flush frequency and severity, was similar to that of Divigel 0.5 mg and of Estrogel 0.75 and 1.5 mg. Overall, our analysis showed that Divigel 1.0 mg provided the best efficacy profile, but that this treatment was also associated with a higher risk of AEs. The network meta-analysis also showed that treatment with Estrogel 1.5 mg was associated with the smallest estimate of reduction in frequency of hot flushes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26382309,

One important application is an indirect comparison of a new treatment with a placebo control on the basis of two separate randomized clinical trials: a non-inferiority trial comparing the new treatment with an active control and a historical trial comparing the active control with placebo. The available methods for treatment effect calibration include an outcome regression (OR) method based on a regression model for the outcome and a weighting method based on a propensity score (PS) model. This article proposes new methods for treatment effect calibration: one based on a conditional effect (CE) model and two doubly robust (DR) methods. The first DR method involves a PS model and an OR model, is asymptotically valid if either model is correct, and attains the semiparametric information bound if both models are correct. The second DR method involves a PS model, a CE model, and possibly an OR model, is asymptotically valid under the union of the PS and CE models, and attains the semiparametric information bound if all three models are correct. The various methods are compared in a simulation study and applied to recent clinical trials for treating human immunodeficiency virus infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic,methodological",26363775,

We performed a network meta-analysis to assess the impact of different combinations of B vitamins on risk of stroke. METHODS: A total of 17 trials (86 393 patients) comparing 7 treatment strategies and placebo were included. A network meta-analysis combined all available direct and indirect treatment comparisons to evaluate the efficacy of B vitamin supplementation for all interventions. RESULTS: B vitamin supplementation was associated with reduced risk of stroke and cerebral hemorrhage. The risk of stroke was lower with folic acid plus vitamin B6 as compared with folic acid plus vitamin B12 and was lower with folic acid plus vitamin B6 plus vitamin B12 as compared with placebo or folic acid plus vitamin B12. The treatments ranked in order of efficacy for stroke, from higher to lower, were folic acid plus vitamin B6 > folic acid > folic acid plus vitamin B6 plus vitamin B12 > vitamin B6 plus vitamin B12 > niacin > vitamin B6 > placebo > folic acid plus vitamin B12. CONCLUSIONS: B vitamin supplementation was associated with reduced risk of stroke; different B vitamins and their combined treatments had different efficacy on stroke prevention. Folic acid plus vitamin B6 might be the optimal therapy for stroke prevention. Folic acid and vitamin B6 were both valuable for stroke prevention.

We estimated the comparative efficacy of antiviral drugs for prevention of vertical transmission of HBV, through a network meta-analysis of clinical trials. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and published proceedings from major liver meetings from January 1980 to November 2014. We conducted pair-wise meta-analyses and Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, combining direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. RESULTS: Seventeen clinical trials involving 2764 newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen seropositive mothers were eligible for analysis. There were no clinical trials involving tenofovir or entecavir. On pair-wise meta-analyses, telbivudine (hazard ratio, HR 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.37; I(2)  = 0%), and Lamivudine (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24-0.65; I(2)  = 0%), were more effective than placebo in reducing vertical transmission of HBV in high viremic hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic Hepatitis B Chinese patients. Sensitivity analyses limited to studies with HBeAg seropositive mothers revealed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a Bayesian network meta-analysis of clinical trials, combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons, telbivudine appears to be more effective than Lamivudine for preventing vertical transmission of HBV infection.

However, the efficiency of postoperative chemotherapy without radiotherapy is unclear, especially in early stage (stages I and II). We aimed to assess the effect of postoperative chemotherapy without radiotherapy in early stage patients. METHODS: Databases and manual searches were adopted to identify eligible randomized control trials. Hazard ratio (HR) was used to assess the advantage of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) by fixed or random-effects models. RESULTS: Fourteen trials with 3,923 patients were included based on inclusion criteria. Compared with surgery alone, postoperative chemotherapy significantly improved DFS and OS with HR of 0.71 (P=0.005) and 0.74 (P<0.00001), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed both cisplatin-based (HR: 0.75, P<0.0001) and single tegafur-uracil (UFT) chemotherapy (HR: 0.72, P=0.002) yielded significant survival benefits, but the latter did not improve DFS (HR: 1.04, P=0.81). Indirect treatment comparison showed cisplatin-based chemotherapy was superior to single UFT in DFS, but comparable in OS. The benefits of postoperative chemotherapy were maintained in patients in stage I (HR: 0.74, P<0.00001) and IB (HR: 0.74, P=0.0003), but not in stage IA, although the trend supported chemotherapy (HR: 0.76, P=0.43). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that postoperative chemotherapy without radiotherapy improves survival of stage I-II, I, and IB non-small cell lung cancer patients, but not for IA. Meanwhile, efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is comparable to single UFT in OS, but better in DFS, which should be paid more attention in future clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26346974,PMC4531011

Primary efficacy outcomes were objective response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival. Safety endpoints were grade 3/4 toxicities, serious adverse events and withdrawals or deaths due to toxicity. Studies were selected if they were randomized controlled trials reporting on the efficacy or safety of treatments for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, and if outcomes were reported separately from trials that included other lymphoid neoplasms. We used the Bucher method for conducting adjusted indirect comparisons within a meta-analysis. We identified 10 randomized controlled trials of treatments for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. The most prominent drug investigated (alone or in combination) was rituximab. Most trials did not report median overall survival. Two trials reported median event-free survival (range, 1.2-23.2 months). Six of ten trials reported objective response rate (range, 9-93%). Meta-analysis showed only one statistically significant result: rituximab + bortezomib yielded a significantly higher objective response rate than rituximab monotherapy (relative risk, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.47). Otherwise, there were no discernable differences in overall survival or progression-free survival, partly due to insufficient reporting of results in the clinical trials. The relatively small number of randomized controlled trials, few overlapping treatment arms, and variability in the randomized controlled trial features and in the endpoints studied complicate the formal comparison of therapies for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. Additional well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to fully understand the relative outcomes of older and more recently developed therapies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26320127,

OBJECTIVES: To develop hypothetical case studies of health economic promotions to examine legal and policy implications. METHODS: We constructed for pedagogical purposes 10 categories of potential health economic promotions. We generated hypothetical case studies for each category, including questions about whether each might be allowable under Section 114. The case studies were developed around the following categories: 1) costing out on-label clinical end points; 2) promotion of a costing exercise to physicians working in an accountable care organization setting; 3) burden-of-illness claims; 4) economic analysis of a formulary restriction policy; 5) extrapolations to doses, populations, or settings not covered in trials; 6) adherence claims; 7) ""utilization of care"" as a secondary end point in randomized clinical trials; 8) costing out a competitor drug's adverse event; 9) economic analysis of comparative effectiveness claims using an indirect treatment comparison; and 10) extrapolating from surrogate to long-term outcomes in an economic model. DISCUSSION: Most cases seem to fall into a gray zone given haziness around what constitutes ""competent and reliable evidence"" and ""directly relate[d]"" to an approved indication.

However, to date no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has directly compared intranasal midazolam with buccal midazolam. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to indirectly compare intranasal midazolam with buccal midazolam in the treatment of early SE using common reference-based indirect comparison meta-analyses. METHODS: RCTs comparing intranasal or buccal midazolam versus either intravenous or rectal diazepam for early SE were systematically searched. Random-effects Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses were performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for the efficacy and safety of intranasal or buccal midazolam versus either intravenous or rectal diazepam. Adjusted indirect comparisons were then made between intranasal and buccal midazolam using the obtained results. RESULTS: Fifteen studies, with a total of 1662 seizures in 1331 patients (some studies included patients with more than one episode of SE) were included; 1303 patients were younger than 16 years. Indirect comparisons showed no difference between intranasal and buccal midazolam for seizure cessation (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.32-3.01, comparator: intravenous diazepam; OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.46-1.64, comparator: rectal diazepam). For serious adverse effects, we found a large width and asymmetrical distribution of confidence intervals around the obtained OR of 2.81 (95% CI 0.39-20.12; comparator: rectal diazepam). No data were available for OR using intravenous diazepam as the comparator. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect comparisons suggest that intranasal and buccal midazolam share similar efficacy in the treatment of early SE in children. Intranasal midazolam should be used with caution and under clinical monitoring of vital functions. RCTs directly comparing intranasal midazolam with buccal midazolam are required to confirm these findings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26293745,

However, it is unclear whether statins as class or type (lipophilic or hydrophilic) improve outcomes of established HF. AIMS: The current meta-analysis was performed to compare the treatment effects of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins on inflammation and cardiac function in HF. Outcomes were indicators of cardiac function [changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)] and inflammation [changes in highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interluekin-6 (IL-6)]. METHOD: We conducted a search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases until December 31, 2014 for randomized control trials (RCTs) of statin versus placebo in patients with HF. RCTs with their respective extracted information were dichotomized into statin type evaluated and analyzed separately. Outcomes were pooled with random effect approach, producing standardized mean differences (SMD) for each statin type. Using these pooled estimates, we performed adjusted indirect comparisons for each outcome. RESULTS: Data from 6214 patients from 19 trials were analyzed. Lipophilic statin was superior to hydrophilic statin treatment regarding follow-up LVEF (SMD, 4.54; 95% CI, 4.16-4.91; P < 0.001), BNP (SMD, -1.60; 95% CI, -2.56 to -0.65; P < 0.001), hsCRP (SMD, -1.13; 95% CI, -1.54 to -0.72; P < 0.001), and IL-6 (SMD, -3.75; 95% CI, -4.77 to -0.72; P < 0.001) in HF. CONCLUSIONS: Lipophilic statin produces greater treatment effects on cardiac function and inflammation compared with hydrophilic statin in patients with HF. Until data from adequately powered head-to-head trial of the statin types are available, our meta-analysis brings clinicians and researchers a step closer to the quest on which statin--lipophilic or hydrophilic--is associated with better outcomes in HF.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26280110,

Through systematic literature review, we identified nine randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) including 964 patients with biopsy-proven NASH, comparing vitamin E, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), pentoxifylline, or obeticholic acid to one another or placebo. The primary outcome was improvement in fibrosis stage; secondary outcomes were improvement in ballooning degeneration, lobular inflammation, and steatosis. We reported relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from direct meta-analysis and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) from Bayesian network meta-analysis, and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise quality of evidence. Moderate-quality evidence supports the use of pentoxifylline (RR, 0.26; 95% CrI: 0.05-1.00) and obeticholic acid (RR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) over placebo in improving fibrosis. High-quality evidence supports the effect of vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic acid over placebo in improving ballooning degeneration. All four interventions seemed to have at least moderate-quality evidence over placebo to improve steatosis. Moderate-quality evidence supports that TZDs, pentoxifylline, and obeticholic acid decrease lobular inflammation. All the head-to-head comparisons were supported by very-low-quality evidence except for superiority of TZDs over vitamin E on improving steatosis and lobular inflammation, which had moderate-quality evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Based on direct and network meta-analysis, pentoxifylline and obeticholic acid improve fibrosis, and vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic acid improve ballooning degeneration in patients with NASH. Future comparative trials of combination therapies targeting distinct histological features are warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26189925,

This study evaluatedthe cost-utility of certolizumab pegol versusTNF-inhibitors plus methotrexate in the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA in Spain. METHODS: A Markov cohort health state transition model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility (costs and quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of certolizumab pegol versus other TNF-inhibitors licensed in Spain in 2009. Efficacy was measured using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses at 6 months, based on adjusted indirect comparisons from published clinical trials. Utilities were derived from EQ-5D data from certolizumab pegol RA clinical trials. Clinical history and resource use data came from published literature. Unit costs were taken from Spanish databases or published data (cost year 2009). Base case analyses were conducted from the payer perspective, with a lifetime horizon, 3.5 % annual discounting rates for costs and outcomes, and 3 % inflation rate for 2009 onwards. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The average lifetime costs for certolizumab pegol, etanercept, adalimumab (every 2 weeks and weekly) and infliximab (3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) in combination with methotrexate were €140,971, €141,197, €139,148, €164,741, €136,961 and €152,561, respectively. The QALYs gained were 6.578, 6.462, 6.430 (for both adalimumab doses), 6.430, and 6.318 (for both infliximab doses), respectively. At a €30,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, certolizumab pegol plus methotrexate dominated adalimumab weekly, etanercept, and infliximab 5 mg/kg, and was cost-effective versus adalimumab every 2 weeks and infliximab 3 mg/kg (all with methotrexate), with estimated ICERs of €12,346/QALY and €15,414/QALY, respectively. Certolizumab pegol monotherapy was more cost-effective versus adalimumab, and less expensive with similar health gains versus etanercept (6.416 QALYs vs 6.492). Univariate analysis showed ICERs to be sensitive to changes in time horizon, ACR response time point, baseline Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, and rate of HAQ-disability index deterioration after discontinuing treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that certolizumab pegol is cost-effective compared with other TNF-inhibitors recommended in Spain for the treatment of RA.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26124700,PMC4484891

In previous work with generic tuberculosis medicines prequalified by the WHO, it was observed that although indirect comparisons are an effective approach for confirming the interchangeability of generics, the approach is subject to less precision than direct comparisons. The objective of this investigation was to explore this by examining the influence of point estimates and power of bioequivalence studies versus the reference on the ability to show equivalence in indirect comparisons. METHODS: Power was considered as a determining factor instead of variability and sample size, because sample size is calculated based on variability and desired power. Scenarios were computed combining a range of point estimate differences (0-14 %) and statistical power of the studies (50-99.99 %). RESULTS: The indirect comparisons could conclude equivalence between generics only when (a) point estimate differences between generics were low (≤ 5.5 %) for any sufficiently powered study (> 80 %), or (b) the differences were large (but less than 14 %) and both bioequivalence studies were overpowered (e.g., 10 % difference and power ≥ 95 %). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the ability to demonstrate interchangeability between generics is dependent not only on the real differences between the products but also on the design of the original generic vs. reference bioequivalence studies being combined, as earmarked by their respective power.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",26105964,

Joint synthesis can improve efficiency over separate univariate syntheses, may reduce selective outcome reporting biases, and enables joint inferences across the outcomes. A common issue is that within-study correlations needed to fit the multivariate model are unknown from published reports. However, provision of individual participant data (IPD) allows them to be calculated directly. Here, we illustrate how to use IPD to estimate within-study correlations, using a joint linear regression for multiple continuous outcomes and bootstrapping methods for binary, survival and mixed outcomes. In a meta-analysis of 10 hypertension trials, we then show how these methods enable multivariate meta-analysis to address novel clinical questions about continuous, survival and binary outcomes; treatment-covariate interactions; adjusted risk/prognostic factor effects; longitudinal data; prognostic and multiparameter models; and multiple treatment comparisons.

We assessed the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for severe AH, through a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review, through February 2015, for randomized controlled trials of adults with severe AH (discriminant function ≥32 and/or hepatic encephalopathy) that compared the efficacy of active pharmacologic interventions (corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, and N-acetylcysteine [NAC], alone or in combination) with each other or placebo, in reducing short-term mortality (primary outcome) and medium-term mortality, acute kidney injury, and/or infections (secondary outcomes). We performed direct and Bayesian network meta-analysis for all treatments, and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria to appraise quality of evidence. RESULTS: We included 22 randomized controlled trials (2621 patients) comparing 5 different interventions. In a direct meta-analysis, only corticosteroids decreased risk of short-term mortality. In a network meta-analysis, moderate quality evidence supported the use of corticosteroids alone (relative risk [RR], 0.54; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.39-0.73) or in combination with pentoxifylline (RR, 0.53; 95% CrI, 0.36-0.78) or NAC (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.39), to reduce short-term mortality; low quality evidence showed that pentoxifylline also decreased short-term mortality (RR, 0.70; 95% CrI, 0.50-0.97). The addition of NAC, but not pentoxifylline, to corticosteroids may be superior to corticosteroids alone for reducing short-term mortality. No treatment was effective in reducing medium-term mortality. Imprecise estimates and the small number of direct trials lowered the confidence in several comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe AH, pentoxifylline and corticosteroids (alone and in combination with pentoxifylline or NAC) can reduce short-term mortality. No treatment decreases risk of medium-term mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26091937,

The objective of this study was to investigate generic-generic drug interchangeability in a large subset of generic formulations in order to cover a broad spectrum of drugs. METHODS: Orally administered drugs for investigation in this study were selected using strict, predefined criteria, with the purpose to avoid bias. This selection procedure yielded atorvastatin, bicalutamide, naratriptan, olanzapine, perindopril, and venlafaxine. Further, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil were investigated as test immunosuppressants. Adjusted indirect comparisons were conducted between generic drugs containing the same active substance, and the 90% confidence interval (CI) for AUC and Cmax was calculated. RESULTS: In total, 120 bioequivalence studies were identified in the Dutch medicine regulatory agency's database, allowing 292 indirect comparisons between generic drugs. The indirect comparison results indicated that in the vast majority of cases, i.e., 80.5%, the 90% CIs for both AUCt and Cmax fell within the bioequivalence criteria (in 90.1 and 87.0% for AUCt and Cmax, respectively). In 1% of the 292 indirect comparison for AUCt and 3% for Cmax, a wider range of 75-133% (or 80-125%) was exceeded.

Lurasidone and quetiapine extended-release (XR) are atypical antipsychotic agents indicated for monotherapy treatment of bipolar depression. Lurasidone is also indicated as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of lurasidone and quetiapine XR in patients with bipolar depression. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare lurasidone to quetiapine XR. The model was based on a US third-party payer perspective over a 3-month time horizon. The effectiveness measure in the model was the percentage of patients achieving remission (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score ≤12 by weeks 6-8). The comparison of remission rates was made through an adjusted indirect treatment comparison of lurasidone and quetiapine XR pivotal trials using placebo as the common comparator. Resource utilization for remission vs no remission was estimated from published expert panel data, and resource costs were obtained from a retrospective database study of bipolar I depression patients. Drug costs were estimated using the mean dose from clinical trials and wholesale acquisition costs. RESULTS: Over the 3-month model time period, lurasidone and quetiapine XR patients, respectively, had similar mean numbers of emergency department visits (0.48 vs 0.50), inpatient days (2.1 vs 2.2), and office visits (9.3 vs 9.6). More lurasidone than quetiapine XR patients achieved remission (52.0% vs 43.2%) with slightly higher total costs ($4982 vs $4676), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3474 per remission. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed lurasidone had an 86% probability of being cost-effective compared to quetiapine XR at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $10,000 per remission. CONCLUSIONS: Lurasidone may be a cost-effective option when compared to quetiapine XR for the treatment of adults with bipolar depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25985265,

However, little information exists comparing it with acarbose which is also commonly used in China. This study expanded knowledge by combining direct and indirect evidence to ascertain the glucose lowering effects of both drugs. METHODS: PubMed (1980- December 2013) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases (1994-January 2014) were systematically searched for eligible randomized controlled trials from Chinese and English literatures. Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the glucose lowering effects of metformin vs. acarbose, or either of them vs. common comparators (placebo or sulphonylureas), using random- and fixed-effect models. Bucher method with indirect treatment comparison calculator was applied to convert the summary estimates from the meta-analyses into weighted-mean-difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to represent the comparative efficacy between metformin and acarbose. RESULTS: A total of 75 studies were included in the analysis. In direct comparison (8 trials), metformin reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.06% more than acarbose, with no significant difference (WMD,-0.06%; 95% CI, -0.32% to 0.20%). In indirect comparisons (67 trials), by using placebo and sulphonylureas as common comparators, metformin achieved significant HbA1c reduction than acarbose, by -0.38% (WMD,-0.38%, 95% CI, -0.736% to -0.024%) and -0.34% (WMD, -0.34%, 95% CI, -0.651% to -0.029%) respectively. CONCLUSION: The glucose lowering effects of metformin monotherapy and acarbose monotherapy are the same by direct comparison, while metformin is a little better by indirect comparison.

Including IPD in NMA may enable the prevention of misleading inferences due to several biases, such as aggregation bias. Application of IPD-NMA methods in healthcare have begun to appear in medical journals. Our objective is to conduct a scoping review of existing IPD-NMA methods, and summarise their properties. We also aim to describe the characteristics of empirical IPD-NMAs, and examine how their results are reported. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search relevant electronic databases from inception until October 2014 (eg, MEDLINE), grey literature, and Google. The scoping review will consider published and unpublished papers that report completion of an IPD-NMA, describe a method, or report the methodological quality of IPD-NMA. We will include IPD-NMA of any quantitative study (eg, experimental, quasiexperimental, observational studies). Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles, and will complete data abstraction. The anticipated outcome will be a collection of all the IPD-NMAs completed to date, and a description of their methods and reporting of results. We will create summary tables providing the characteristics of the included studies, and the various methods. Quantitative data (eg, number of patients) will be summarised by medians and IQRs, and categorical data (eg, type of effect size) by frequencies and percentages.

The clinical evidence for vemurafenib was derived from a completed phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BRIM-3) involving 675 patients randomized 1:1 to receive either vemurafenib or dacarbazine. A significant improvement in median PFS and OS was reported in the vemurafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. As there is no direct evidence comparing dabrafenib versus vemurafenib, the company presented an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) that demonstrated no statistical differences between dabrafenib and vemurafenib for PFS or OS. The ERG expressed concerns with the ITC, mainly in relation to the validity of the assumptions underpinning the methodology; the ERG concluded this resulted in findings that are unlikely to be robust or reliable. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are both available to patients treated by the National Health Service (NHS) in England via a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) in which the costs of the drugs are discounted. Using these discounted costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) generated by the company were £60,980 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for dabrafenib versus dacarbazine and £11,046 per QALY gained for dabrafenib versus vemurafenib. The ERG considered the economic model structure developed by the company to derive the ICERs to be overly complex and based on unsubstantiated assumptions, most importantly in relation to the projection of OS. Applying the latest OS data from BREAK-3 to a less complex model structure increased the estimated ICER for dabrafenib compared with dacarbazine from £60,980 to £112,727 per QALY gained. Since the results from the ITC were considered by the ERG to be neither reliable nor robust, the ERG also considered a cost-effectiveness comparison to be inappropriate due to a lack of meaningful or reliable data. In spite of limitations in the data, the AC took the view that dabrafenib and vemurafenib were ""likely"" of similar clinical effectiveness. Since the overall costs of these two drugs were similar, the AC recommended the use of dabrafenib in patients with unresectable, advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,not_original_article",25906420,

It is sometimes not possible to perform treatment comparisons as evidence networks restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may be disconnected. We propose a Bayesian NMA model that allows to include single-arm, before-and-after, observational studies to complete these disconnected networks. We illustrate the method with an indirect comparison of treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). METHODS: Our method uses a random effects model for placebo improvements to include single-arm observational studies into a general NMA. Building on recent research for binary outcomes, we develop a covariate-adjusted continuous-outcome NMA model that combines individual patient data (IPD) and aggregate data from two-arm RCTs with the single-arm observational studies. We apply this model to a complex comparison of therapies for PAH combining IPD from a phase-III RCT of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH and aggregate data from RCTs and single-arm observational studies, both identified by a systematic review. RESULTS: Through the inclusion of observational studies, our method allowed the comparison of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH with other treatments. This comparison had not been previously possible due to the limited RCT evidence available. However, the credible intervals of our posterior estimates were wide so the overall results were inconclusive. The comparison should be treated as exploratory and should not be used to guide clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Our method for the inclusion of single-arm observational studies allows the performance of indirect comparisons that had previously not been possible due to incomplete networks composed solely of available RCTs. We also built on many recent innovations to enable researchers to use both aggregate data and IPD. This method could be used in similar situations where treatment comparisons have not been possible due to restrictions to RCT evidence and where a mixture of aggregate data and IPD are available.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""TO READ +++ : talk about another method for ITC combining both IPD and aggregated data!""]}",25887646,PMC4403724

METHODS: An exhaustive search was performed until October 2013. Databases consulted were MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Web of Science. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of infliximab, adalimumab or golimumab versus placebo, in terms of clinical remission, clinical response and mucosal healing, were included. In the case that more than one RCT fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the same drug, a metanalysis was undertaken using a fixed effects model. ITCs were carried out using the method proposed by Bucher et al. RESULTS: 6 RCTs published in 5 papers were included: 2 for infliximab (ACT 1 and ACT 2), 2 for adalimumab (ULTRA 1 y ULTRA 2) and 2 for golimumab (PURSUIT-SC y PURSUIT-M).In these RTCs, each biological agent was superior in efficacy to placebo. The results of the adjusted ITC are the following. In relation to the clinical remission, in the induction and maintenance period, there are no statistically significant differences between the three anti-TNF drugs. In relation to the clinical response and mucosal healing, in the induction period, there are statistically significant differences between infliximab and adalimumab. CONCLUSION: In view of the results obtained, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab appear to be similarly effective therapeutic alternatives. Therefore, other considerations such as safety, tolerance and cost-effectiveness should be taken into account in order to select the most appropriate treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""To read as an example of the potential distinction between Bucher and MA""]}",25817087,

These effects must therefore be derived from indirect comparisons of results from different studies. The feasibility of comparisons relies on the network linking treatments through common comparators; the reliability of these may also be impacted when the studies are heterogeneous or when multiple intermediate comparisons are needed to link two specific treatments of interest. Simulated treatment comparison and matching-adjusted indirect comparison have been developed to address these challenges. These focus on comparisons of outcomes for two specific treatments of interest by using patient-level data for one treatment (the index) and published results for the other treatment (the comparator) from compatible studies, taking into account possible confounding due to population differences.

METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify the relevant NMAs using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Health Technology Assessment. The synthesis studies were evaluated using the ""Questionnaire to assess the relevance and credibility of the NMA."" RESULTS: Eleven NMAs evaluating NOACs among adults with nonvalvular AF were identified. Most NMAs included three large phase III randomized controlled trials, comparing NOACs to adjusted-dose warfarin (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy [RE-LY], Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation [ROCKET-AF], and Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE]). The main differences identified related to potential treatment effect modifiers regarding the mean time spent in therapeutic range (TTR) in the warfarin arm, the risk of stroke or systemic embolism across the trials (mean CHADS2 score: C = congestive heart failure, H = hypertension, A = older than age 75 years, D = diabetes mellitus, S2 = prior stroke or history of transient ischemic attack) or primary versus secondary prevention, and type of populations used in the analysis.

The purpose of this study was to conduct an integrated database analysis of patient level data to compare the effects of duloxetine with those of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at the doses approved in Japan. METHODS: Pooled data were analyzed from four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that compared duloxetine at the dose range approved in Japan (40-60 mg/day) with other SSRIs (paroxetine 20 mg/day or escitalopram 10 mg/day) and placebo in patients with major depressive disorder. In total, 1,694 patients were included in the analysis (duloxetine, n=688; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, n=690; placebo, n=316). The primary outcome measure was the mean change from baseline at week 8 in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17) total and subscale scores. RESULTS: Duloxetine and both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were superior to placebo in HAMD17 total score at week 8 in both the all-randomized group and the more severe subgroup (HAMD17 total scores ≥19). Duloxetine was superior to SSRIs in improving the HAMD17 Retardation subscale score (least squares mean difference [95% confidence interval]): all-randomized group, -0.33 [-0.60, -0.07], P=0.015; severe subgroup, -0.45 [-0.83, -0.07], P=0.020). CONCLUSION: Within the dose range approved in Japan for patients with major depressive disorder, duloxetine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors demonstrated comparable overall efficacy, with a possible advantage for duloxetine in improving loss of energy and interest. To the best of our knowledge, this analysis is unique not only in evaluating dosages specific to Japan, but also in using individual patient data and the same endpoint across studies to allow for strictly direct head-to-head data comparisons as opposed to pooling direct and indirect comparisons.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",25624763,PMC4296960

Novel tools have been developed building upon the historical approach of reviewing the literature focusing on a specific topic. Stemming from qualitative reviews, systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials, typically encompassing statistical pooling with pairwise meta-analysis, have been devised and are now considered one of the uppermost ladders in the hierarchy of clinical evidence. In the last decade, the exponential growth in randomized trials and the introduction of original computational methods have created the novel opportunity to compare indirectly competing treatments, as well as combining effect estimates stemming from head-to-head trials with those obtained by indirect comparisons. These methods include adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, and mixed treatment comparison. While still the focus of intense research and debate, they represent a powerful tool for evidence synthesis and comparative effectiveness in cardiovascular research, and thus are likely to become increasingly popular and impactful in shaping research agenda and clinical practice. This is clearly highlighted by a number of recent landmark network meta-analyses on smoking cessation therapies, coronary stents, and management of patent foramen ovale in patients with history of cryptogenic stroke.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",25585376,

Well-established drug class efficacies have become commonplace in many disease areas. Thus, for reasons of ethics and equipoise, it is not practical to randomize patients to placebo or older drug classes. Unique randomized clinical trial designs are an attempt to navigate these obstacles. These alternative designs, however, pose challenges when attempting to incorporate data into NMAs. Using ulcerative colitis as an example, we illustrate an example of a method where data provided by these trials are used to populate treatment networks. METHODS: We present the methods used to convert data from the PURSUIT trial into a typical parallel design for inclusion in our NMA. Data were required for three arms: golimumab 100 mg; golimumab 50 mg; and placebo. Golimumab 100 mg induction data were available; however, data regarding those individuals who were nonresponders at induction and those who were responders at maintenance were not reported, and as such, had to be imputed using data from the rerandomization phase. Golimumab 50 mg data regarding responses at week 6 were not available. Existing relationships between the available components were used to impute the expected proportions in this missing subpopulation. Data for placebo maintenance response were incomplete, as all induction nonresponders were assigned to golimumab 100 mg. Data from the PURSUIT trial were combined with ACT-1 and ULTRA-2 trial data to impute missing information. DISCUSSION: We have demonstrated methods for converting results from alternative study designs to more conventional parallel randomized clinical trials. These conversions allow for indirect treatment comparisons that are informed by a wider array of evidence, adding to the precision of estimates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",25565891,PMC4278731

In phase II/III randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted in Japan, SMV, in combination with peginterferon-α and ribavirin (PEG IFN/RBV), demonstrated potent efficacy in HCV genotype 1-infected patients relative to PEG IFN/RBV and was generally well tolerated. Telaprevir (TVR) in combination with PEG IFN/RBV is licensed for the treatment of HCV in Japan. In the absence of head-to-head comparisons of TVR and SMV in a Japanese population, we undertook a network meta-analysis (NMA) to examine the relative efficacy and safety of SMV and TVR in combination with PEG IFN/RBV. METHODS: A systematic review identified SMV and TVR RCT in Japanese treatment-naïve patients. Bayesian NMA was performed assuming fixed study effects. RESULTS: Three studies met our inclusion criteria: two SMV and one TVR. SMV showed a higher mean odds ratio (OR) of achieving SVR versus TVR (OR, 1.68 (95% credible interval 0.66-4.26)). SMV showed a lower mean OR of discontinuation: overall, 0.35 (0.12-1.00); and due to AE, 0.87 (0.23-3.34) versus TVR. SMV showed a lower mean OR of experiencing anemia 0.20 (0.07-0.56) and rash 0.41 (0.17-0.99) but a higher mean OR of experiencing pruritus 1.26 (0.46-3.47) versus TVR.

METHODS: Direct and adjusted indirect comparisons of all the recent randomized control trials (RCTs) were performed to evaluate the safety of short-term versus long-term DAPT following DES. RESULTS: 8 RCTs were identified and 7 (16,318 subjects) were included. 4 groups of 3 vs 12 months, 6 vs 12 months, 6 vs 24 months and 12 vs 24 months of DAPT were used for direct comparison. There was no significant difference in stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and revascularization, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality between the different durations in all 4 groups. Pooling trials of 3-6 months of DAPT against 12 months, we found a significant reduction in the risk of total bleeding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.87). Adjusted indirect comparison between 3 vs 6 months, 3 vs 24 months and 6 vs 24 month duration of DAPT showed no significant differences in risk of death or MI, or revascularization between 3 or 6 months and 24 months. However, 24months of DAPT was associated with significantly more bleeding than 3 or 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: 3 to 6 months of DAPT following second generation DES and above is safe with no increased risk of thrombotic complications and mortality, and lower bleeding risk.

The aim of this systematic review is to answer the clinical question, whether conventional high-viscosity glass-ionomer restorations, in patients with single and/or multi-surface cavities in posterior permanent teeth, have indeed a higher failure rate than direct hybrid resin composite restorations. METHODS: Eight databases were searched until December 02, 2013. Trials were assessed for bias risks, in-between datasets heterogeneity and statistical sample size power. Effects sizes were computed and statistically compared. A total of 55 citations were identified through systematic literature search. From these, 46 were excluded. No trials related to high-viscosity glass-ionomers versus resin composite restorations for direct head-to-head comparison were found. Three trials related to high-viscosity glass-ionomers versus amalgam and three trials related to resin composite versus amalgam restorations could be included for adjusted indirect comparison, only. RESULTS: The available evidence suggests no difference in the failure rates between both types of restoration beyond the play of chance, is limited by lack of head-to-head comparisons and an insufficient number of trials, as well as by high bias and in-between-dataset heterogeneity risk. The current clinical evidence needs to be regarded as too poor in order to justify superiority claims regarding the failure rates of both restoration types. Sufficiently large-sized, parallel-group, randomised control trials with high internal validity are needed, in order to justify any clinically meaningful judgment to this topic.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",26962372,PMC4768657

There are as many as 20 million cases of sepsis annually worldwide, with a mortality rate of around 35%. It has been reported that the dysregulation of haemostatic system due to the interaction between coagulation system and inflammatory response is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with severe sepsis. In this context, several anticoagulants have been evaluated in recent years. However, the results of these studies were inconsistent and even contradictory. In addition, there is insufficient evidence comparing the efficacy and safety of different anticoagulants. The purpose of our study is to carry out a systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of different anticoagulants for severe sepsis based on existing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and ranking these anticoagulants for practical consideration.

METHODS: We built a new score named total incremental net benefit (TINB), with inverse variance weighting of incremental net benefits (INB). This permits determination of whether an alternative is cost-effective, given a specific threshold (TINB > 0 test). Before validation of the model, the structure of dependence between costs and quality-adjusted life years (QoL) was analysed using copula distributions. The goodness-of-fit of a Spanish prospective observational study (n = 498) was analysed using the Independent, Gaussian, T, Gumbel, Clayton, Frank and Placket copulas. Validation was carried out by simulating a copula distribution with log-normal distribution for costs and gamma distribution for disutilities. Hypothetical cohorts were created by varying the sample size (n: 15-500) and assuming three scenarios (1-cost-effective; 2-non-cost-effective; 3-dominant). The COMER result was compared to the theoretical result according to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the INB, assuming a margin of error of 2,000 and 500 monetary units, respectively. RESULTS: The Frank copula with positive dependence (-0.4279) showed a goodness-of-fit sufficient to represent costs and QoL (p-values 0.524 and 0.808). The theoretical INB was within the 95% confidence interval of the TINB, based on 15 individuals with a probability > 80% for scenarios 1 and 2, and > 90% for scenario 3. The TINB > 0 test with 15 individuals showed p-values of 0.0105 (SD: 0.0411) for scenario 1, 0.613 (SD: 0.265) for scenario 2 and < 0.0001 for scenario 3.

Paracetamol is often the first line analgesic recommended, without consensus about which is the better analgesic. METHODS: An overview review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses directly compares ibuprofen and paracetamol at standard doses in particular painful conditions, or uses indirect comparisons against placebo. Electronic searches for systematic reviews were sought published since 1995 using outcomes approximating to ≥50% pain intensity reduction. Painful conditions were acute post-operative pain, dysmenorrhoea, tension-type headache (TTH), migraine, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, back pain, cancer and paediatric pain. There was no systematic assessment of harm. RESULTS: Sixteen systematic reviews and four individual patient data meta-analyses were included. Ibuprofen was consistently superior to paracetamol at conventional doses in a range of painful conditions. Two direct comparisons favoured ibuprofen (acute pain, osteoarthritis). Three of four indirect comparisons favoured ibuprofen (acute pain, migraine, osteoarthritis); one showed no difference (TTH), although there were methodological problems. In five pain conditions (dysmenorrhoea, paediatric pain, cancer pain, back pain and rheumatoid arthritis), there were limited data on paracetamol and ibuprofen. CONCLUSIONS: At standard doses in different painful conditions, ibuprofen was usually superior producing more patients with the degree of pain relief that patients feel worthwhile.

In this study, a systematic literature search was performed to capture survival and postoperative morbidity and mortality data in randomised clinical studies comparing preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy or chemotherapy versus surgery alone, or preoperative chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy for gastric and/or gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) cancer. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall mortality were extracted from the original studies, individual patient data provided from the principal investigators of eligible studies or the earlier published meta-analysis. The incidences of postoperative morbidities and mortalities were also analysed. In total 18 studies were eligible and data were available from 14 of these. The meta-analysis on overall survival yielded HRs of 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.86, P < 0.001) for preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and 0.83 (95% CI 0.67-1.01, P = 0.065) for preoperative chemotherapy when compared to surgery alone. Direct comparison between preoperative chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy resulted in an HR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.45-1.12, P = 0.146). Combination of direct and adjusted indirect comparisons yielded an HR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.69-1.07, P = 0.171). No statistically significant differences were seen in the risk for postoperative morbidity or mortality between preoperative treatments and surgery alone, or preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy for gastric and GOJ cancer showed significant survival benefit over surgery alone. In comparisons between preoperative chemotherapy and (chemo)radiotherapy, there is a trend towards improved survival when adding radiotherapy, without increased postoperative morbidity or mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25491892,

We investigated whether using individual patient data (IPD) can adjust for this form of bias. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We included IPD of 3 ovarian reserve tests from 32 studies. Inconsistency was defined as a statistically significant difference in relative accuracy or different comparative results between the direct and indirect evidence. We adjusted for the effect of threshold and reference standard, as well as for patient-specific variables. RESULTS: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle stimulation hormone (FSH) differed significantly in sensitivity (-0.1563, P = 0.04). AMH and antral follicle count (AFC) differed significantly in sensitivity (0.1465, P < 0.01). AMH and AFC differed significantly in specificity (-0.0607, P = 0.02). The area under the curve (AUC) differed significantly between AFC and FSH (0.0948, P < 0.01) in the direct comparison but not (0.0678, P = 0.09) in the indirect comparison. The AUCs of AFC and AMH differed significantly (-0.0830, P < 0.01) in the indirect comparison but not (-0.0176, P = 0.29) in the direct comparison. These differences remained after adjusting for indirectness. CONCLUSION: Estimates of comparative accuracy obtained through indirect comparisons are not always consistent with those obtained through direct comparisons. Using IPD to adjust for indirectness did not successfully remove the bias in this case study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""How did they obtained all the individual data?""]}",25475365,

We systematically searched databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase; 1997 to August 2, 2012), conference abstracts, bibliographic reference lists, recent reviews, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Primary efficacy outcomes were objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Safety end points were Grade 3/4 toxicities, serious adverse events, withdrawals because of toxicity, and deaths due to toxicity. Studies were selected if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of relapsed or refractory CLL and if outcomes for CLL were reported separately from trials that included other lymphoid neoplasms. We used the Bucher method for conducting adjusted indirect comparisons within a meta-analysis. We identified 6 RCTs of pharmacologic treatment for relapsed/refractory CLL. The most common drugs investigated (alone or in combination) were fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. When reported, median overall survival ranged from 27.3 to 52.9 months, and overall response rate from 58% to 82%. Although meta-analysis of efficacy results was considered, details are not presented because only 3 studies qualified and the common comparator treatment was not clinically relevant. The relatively small number of RCTs, few overlapping treatment arms, and variability in end points studied make it difficult to formally compare therapies for relapsed/refractory CLL. Significant variability in RCT features presents a further challenge to meaningful comparisons. Additional well-designed RCTs are needed to fully understand the relative efficacy and safety of older and more recently developed therapies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25445467,

This study examines the relative cost-effectiveness of dabigatran (BID dosing of 150 mg or 110 mg based on patient age), rivaroxaban, and apixaban from a UK payer perspective. METHODS: A previously published model that follows up patients through treatment of atrial fibrillation during a lifetime was adapted to allow comparison of the 3 NOACs and warfarin. Acute thromboembolic and bleeding events, as well as long-term consequences of stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and acute myocardial infarction, were tracked. Relative efficacy was calculated from a formal indirect treatment comparison using data from the 3 key trials (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy, Rivaroxaban Once-daily oral direct factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation, and Apixaban for the Prevention of Stroke in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation) of the NOACs. Data from the rivaroxaban trial were adjusted for the difference in international normalized ratio control among warfarin patients versus the other 2 trials. Model outputs included total costs, event rates, and quality-adjusted life-years. FINDINGS: Among the patients taking NOACs, those taking dabigatran had the highest total QALYs (7.68 QALYs), followed by apixaban (7.63 QALYs) and rivaroxaban (7.47 QALYs). Patients taking dabigatran had the lowest total lifetime costs (£23,342), followed by apixaban (£24,014) and rivaroxaban (£25,220). The differences between dabigatran and apixaban were modest but consistent in sensitivity analyses, with the directionality only changing at the limits of the CIs for the relative risks of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage or when assuming that both treatment discontinuation and post-event disability rates differ by drug. IMPLICATIONS: Dabigatran was found to be economically dominant over rivaroxaban and apixaban in the UK setting. These economic findings are based on relative clinical efficacy from an indirect treatment comparison and would benefit from any data of direct comparisons of the NOACs in the future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25438722,

Statistical modeling approaches, which control for differences in patient characteristics, can improve indirect comparisons of the efficacy of these therapies. METHODS: No evidence of disease activity (NEDA) was evaluated as the proportion of patients free from relapses and 3-month confirmed disability progression (clinical composite), free from gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions and new or newly enlarged T2 lesions (magnetic resonance imaging composite), or free from all disease measures (overall composite). For each measure, the efficacy of fingolimod was estimated by analyzing individual patient data from fingolimod phase 3 trials using methodologies from studies of other oral therapies. These data were then used to build binomial regression models, which adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics between the studies. Models predicted the indirect relative risk of achieving NEDA status for fingolimod versus dimethyl fumarate or teriflunomide in an average patient from their respective phase 3 trials. RESULTS: The estimated relative risks of achieving NEDA status for fingolimod versus placebo in a pooled fingolimod trial population were numerically greater (i.e., fingolimod more efficacious) than the estimated relative risks for dimethyl fumarate or teriflunomide versus placebo in each respective trial population. In indirect comparisons, the predicted relative risks for all composite measures were better for fingolimod than comparator when tested against the trial populations of those treated with dimethyl fumarate (relative risk, clinical: 1.21 [95% confidence interval 1.06-1.39]; overall: 1.67 [1.08-2.57]), teriflunomide 7 mg (clinical: 1.22 [1.02-1.46]; overall: 2.01 [1.38-2.93]) and teriflunomide 14 mg (clinical: 1.14 [0.96-1.36]; overall: 1.61 [1.12-2.31]). CONCLUSION: Our modeling approach suggests that fingolimod therapy results in a higher probability of NEDA than dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide therapy when phase 3 trial data are indirectly compared and differences between trials are adjusted for.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""STC, without naming it""]}",25414048,PMC4245493

The primary aims of psychological interventions targeting chronic pain disorders are to reduce patients' pain-related disability and to improve their quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the prevailing treatment for chronic pain, however mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has displayed promise as an alternative treatment option. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare MBSR to CBT in their relative ability to reduce pain-related disability and intensity, to alleviate emotional distress, and to improve global functioning in chronic pain patients. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review with meta-analyses to compare MBSR to CBT in the treatment of chronic pain disorders in adults. We will report our review according to the recommendations provided by the PRISMA statement. Randomized studies will be included and the literature search will comprise Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library on Wiley, including CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, and HTA. Study selection and data extraction will be conducted by independent investigators and in duplicate. Outcomes of interest will include pain interference, pain intensity, emotional functioning, and patient global impression of change. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to assess risk of bias of included studies. As we anticipate that scales used to measure participant responses will be related but varied from study to study, standardized mean differences will be used to compare effect sizes between treatment modalities. Given the possibility of little or no head-to-head evidence comparing MBSR with CBT, we will use indirect treatment comparison methodology to assess the relative effectiveness of these interventions. DISCUSSION: The findings from this study will assist patients and treatment providers to make informed decisions regarding evidence-based treatment selection for chronic pain disorders.

Recognize that rivaroxaban is as efficacious as apixaban but can increase the risk of hemorrhage. Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are at high risk for developing postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE). The authors analyzed the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban vs low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) as VTE prophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery. Outcomes evaluated included total VTE, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), death, and major bleeding. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are more efficacious than dabigatran and are as safe as dabigatran.

This study indirectly compares MR in patients taking nilotinib 300 mg bid with that in those taking dasatinib 100 mg qd by 12 months and through 48 months. METHODS: Patients in ENESTnd were re-weighted to match published baseline characteristics reported for DASISION using a propensity score model. After matching, differences in rates of major MR (MMR, measured as a 3 log reduction on the International Scale [IS]), MR(4.0) (4 log reduction on IS), and MR(4.5) (4.5 log reduction on IS) relative to imatinib were indirectly compared between nilotinib and dasatinib. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to indirectly compare MR outcomes between nilotinib and dasatinib through 48 months of follow-up, while rate differences were used to compare progression to AP/BC between nilotinib and dasatinib by 48 months. RESULTS: After matching, rates of MR by 12 months were higher with nilotinib vs dasatinib by 11.7% for MMR (p = 0.045), 8.2% for MR(4.0) (p = 0.029), and 8.5% for MR(4.5) (p < 0.001). Higher rates of MMR (HR = 1.44, p = 0.018) and MR(4.0) (HR = 1.58, p = 0.013) achievement were maintained with nilotinib compared to dasatinib through 48 months of follow-up.

LIMITATIONS: LIMITATIONS include comparisons based solely on indirect evidence and HRs for MR(4.0) and MR(4.5) from the DASISION trial being extracted from cumulative incidence curves. CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison suggests that nilotinib is associated with higher rates of achieving MMR, MR(4.0), and MR(4.5) by 12 months compared to dasatinib for the treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP. In addition, higher rates of MR achievement with nilotinib were also maintained through 48 months of follow-up.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",25356603,

Hence, the current analysis indirectly compared available evidence on the risk of hypoglycaemia and weight change between lixisenatide and NPH-insulin based on randomized controlled trial (RCT) data with exenatide, insulin glargine and placebo as common references. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane database and clinical registries identified English- and German-language articles published from January 1980 to October 2012 reporting data from RCTs. Only publications of trials that reported outcomes from 24 to 30 weeks comparing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or basal insulin versus another antidiabetic agent or placebo were included. Hypoglycaemia, patients at glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) target and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were treated as binary variables, with risk ratios and odds ratios (ORs) calculated. HbA1c and body weight were treated as continuous variables with difference in mean change from baseline (MD) calculated. Meta-analyses were performed with random effects models and indirect comparisons were performed according to Bucher's method. RESULTS: Seven RCTs (n=3,301 patients) comparing the efficacy and safety of lixisenatide, exenatide, insulin glargine and NPH-insulin with different antidiabetic treatments in adult patients with T2DM were included in the final analysis. In the adjusted indirect comparison, there was a significant difference in symptomatic hypoglycaemia (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = [0.17, 0.85]) and in confirmed hypoglycaemia (OR = 0.46; 95% CI = [0.22, 0.96]) favouring lixisenatide over NPH-insulin and comparable changes in HbA1c from baseline (MD = 0.07%; 95% CI = [-0.26%, 0.41%]). In contrast to NPH-insulin, there was a significant reduction in body weight with lixisenatide (MD = -3.62 kg; 95% CI = [-5.86 kg, -1.38 kg]) at study completion. The number of discontinuations due to AEs numerically favoured NPH-insulin over lixisenatide (OR = 2.64; 95% CI = [0.25, 27.96]), with a broad confidence interval. CONCLUSIONS: Lixisenatide treatment was associated with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and a greater weight loss compared with NPH-insulin. Glycaemic control with lixisenatide treatment was comparable with NPH-insulin. These data suggest that lixisenatide is a beneficial treatment option for T2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control on OADs, and is associated with reduced risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25332702,PMC4202665

We estimated the comparative efficacy of different pharmacologic interventions for postoperative prophylaxis of CD, through a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature through March 2014. We identified randomized controlled trials that compared the abilities of mesalamine, antibiotics, budesonide, immunomodulators, anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF) (started within 3 months of surgery), and/or placebo or no intervention to prevent clinical and/or endoscopic relapse of CD in adults after surgical resection.

Anti-TNF monotherapy was the most effective pharmacologic intervention for postoperative prophylaxis, with large effect sizes relative to all other strategies (clinical relapse: RR, 0.02-0.20; endoscopic relapse: RR, 0.005-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Based on Bayesian network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons, anti-TNF monotherapy appears to be the most effective strategy for postoperative prophylaxis for CD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25263803,PMC4274207

New oral anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran) are recommended for antithrombotic therapy in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with moderate and high risk of stroke. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness ratio of apixaban compared to dabigatran and rivaroxaban in patients with NVAF from the Russian Federation national health care system perspective. METHODS: This analysis used a Markov model that allowed estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for apixaban compared to rivaroxaban and dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg over lifetime horizon for patients with NVAF. The model enclosed cardiovascular event rates based on the results of the indirect treatment comparison that combined data from the randomized clinical trials comparing clinical effectiveness and safety of apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran with warfarin (ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, RE-LY). The following cardiovascular events were considered: ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant non-major bleeds and myocardial infarction. Direct medical costs were determined based on the rates of the compulsory national medical insurance system. The price of the new oral anticoagulants was taken as a weighted average tender price for the year 2013. In the model both costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life years and life-years) were discounted at 3.5%. Cost-effectiveness threshold was set at 1.4 million rubles per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and corresponded to the three times GDP per capita in 2013 in the Russian Federation. RESULTS: In the base case analysis it was demonstrated that apixaban compared to dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg and rivaroxaban provided additional 0.101, 0.060 and 0.072 life years as well as additional 0.063; 0.038 and 0.041 QALYs respectively. Over lifetime horizon apixaban compared to dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg and rivaroxaban required additional treatment costs equal to 22.78; 31.18 and 6.70 thousands rubles, respectively. With that estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for apixaban compared to dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg and rivaroxaban was 362.60, 805.54 and 162.45 thousands rubles per QALY correspondingly. CONCLUSION: Apixaban provided increased life expectancy compared to other new anticoagulants and may be considered as a cost-effective alternative to dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg and rivaroxaban from the Russian Federation national health care system perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25177813,

An AHRQ evidence report on the comparative effectiveness and adverse events of breast biopsy methods was completed in 2009. The availability of additional studies and the uncertainties surrounding newer biopsy techniques prompted an update of that report. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We searched nine electronic databases (last search on December 16, 2013) for English-language full-text reports of prospective or retrospective cohort studies of women not previously diagnosed with breast cancer who were undergoing biopsy for diagnosis of a breast lesion. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: A single investigator extracted quantitative and qualitative data from each study; a second reviewer verified extracted data. We assessed the strength and applicability of the evidence. We performed Bayesian meta-analyses to estimate summary test performance and performed indirect comparisons to assess the relative effectiveness of alternative core needle biopsy methods. Statistical models accounted for between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty studies of moderate to high risk of bias provided information on the test performance of alternative core needle biopsy techniques. We found one new study investigating the test performance of open biopsy. For women at average risk of cancer, both ultrasound- and stereotactically guided biopsies had average sensitivities higher than 0.97 and average specificities ranging from 0.92 to 0.99; freehand biopsy methods had average sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.98. However, evidence on the test performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy (6 studies) was insufficient to draw conclusions. Test performance did not differ between women at average and high baseline risk of cancer, but results were imprecise. Test performance of automated and vacuum-assisted devices (when using the same imaging guidance) was fairly similar (absolute differences in sensitivity and specificity ≤ 0.1). One hundred and forty-one studies contributed information on potential harms of different core needle biopsy techniques. Overall, core needle biopsy had a lower risk of complications than open surgical biopsy; however information on the latter was sparse. The absolute incidence of adverse events was low and the incidence of severe complications was less than 1 percent for all techniques. Vacuum-assisted procedures appeared to be associated with increased bleeding and hematoma formation; biopsies performed with patients seated upright appeared to be associated with increased risk of vasovagal reactions. Harms were reported inconsistently, raising concerns about selective outcome reporting. We found 10 case reports of patients developing tumors at the site of prior core needle biopsies. We found information on only a few patient-relevant and resource-related outcomes. Based on 42 studies, core needle biopsy obviated the need for surgical procedures in about 75 percent of women. Meta-analysis of 10 studies reporting the number of surgical procedures required after biopsy suggested that the odds of requiring only one procedure were almost 15 times as high among women receiving core needle biopsy, as compared to those receiving open surgical biopsy. However, this result may be confounded by indication. LIMITATIONS: Patient-level data were unavailable and information about study- or population-level characteristics was too limited to allow the identification of modifiers of test performance, adverse events, or clinical outcomes. Studies reported adverse events incompletely, and did not provide details of their outcome ascertainment methods. CONCLUSIONS: A large body of evidence suggests that ultrasound and stereotactically guided core needle biopsy procedures have sensitivity and specificity close to that of open biopsy procedures, and are associated with fewer adverse events. The strength of the evidence on the test performance of these methods is deemed moderate because studies are at medium to high risk of bias, but provide precise and fairly consistent results. Freehand procedures have lower sensitivity than imaging-guided methods. The strength of evidence on the comparative test performance of automated and vacuum-assisted devices (when using the same imaging guidance) is deemed low, because of concerns about the risk of bias of included studies and the reliance on indirect comparisons. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions for MRI-guided biopsy or women at high baseline risk of cancer. There is low strength of evidence that vacuum-assisted procedures have a higher risk of bleeding than automated methods. There is moderate strength of evidence that women diagnosed with breast cancer by core needle biopsy are more likely to have their cancer treated with a single surgical procedure, compared with women diagnosed by open surgical biopsy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25275206,

METHODS: A systematic literature review of randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients with COPD was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olodaterol and indacaterol. Network meta-analysis and adjusted indirect comparison methods were employed to evaluate treatment efficacy, using outcomes based on trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Transition Dyspnea Index, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score and response, rescue medication use, and proportion of patients with exacerbations. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were identified for meta-analysis (eight, olodaterol; ten, indacaterol). Olodaterol trials included patients of all severities, whilst indacaterol trials excluded patients with very severe COPD. Concomitant maintenance bronchodilator use was allowed in most olodaterol trials, but not in indacaterol trials. When similarly designed trials/data were analyzed for change from baseline in trough FEV1 (liters), the following mean differences (95% confidence interval) were observed: trials excluding concomitant bronchodilator: indacaterol 75 mcg versus olodaterol 5 mcg, -0.005 (-0.077 to 0.067), and indacaterol 150 mcg versus olodaterol 5 mcg, 0.020 (-0.036 to 0.077); trials with concomitant tiotropium: indacaterol 150 mcg versus olodaterol 5 mcg, 0.000 (-0.043 to 0.042). In sensitivity analyses of the full network, results for change from baseline in trough FEV1 favored indacaterol, but this dataset suffered from trial design heterogeneity. For the other endpoints investigated, no statistically significant differences were found when analyzed in the full network. CONCLUSION: When compared under similar trial conditions, olodaterol and indacaterol have similar efficacy in patients with COPD. This research highlights the importance of considering the concomitant COPD medication when evaluating treatment effects in COPD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25114521,PMC4124050

METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in July to August 2011 and updated in July 2013. For fidaxomicin versus vancomycin, efficacy was evaluated using meta-analysis of data from two Phase III direct comparative studies (n = 1164). As there were no studies comparing fidaxomicin and metronidazole, an indirect comparison was made using data from three vancomycin versus metronidazole studies (n = 345), using the methodology of Bucher et al. (J Clin Epidemiol 1997; 50: 683-91). This provides an OR for the indirect comparison of fidaxomicin versus metronidazole when direct evidence of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin and vancomycin versus metronidazole is available. RESULTS: Clinical cure rates were similar for fidaxomicin and vancomycin; the OR (95% CI) was 1.17 (0.82, 1.66). Recurrence [0.47 (0.34, 0.65)] was significantly lower and sustained cure rates [1.75 (1.35, 2.27)] significantly higher for fidaxomicin than vancomycin. Similar results were obtained in patient subgroups with severe CDI and with non-severe CDI. From the indirect comparison, the likelihood of recurrence [0.42 (0.18, 0.96)] and sustained cure [2.55 (1.44, 4.51)] were significantly improved for fidaxomicin versus metronidazole. Again, similar results were obtained in those with severe and non-severe CDI. CONCLUSIONS: Fidaxomicin provides improved sustained cure rates in patients with CDI compared with vancomycin. An indirect comparison indicates that the same is also true for fidaxomicin versus metronidazole. In view of these data, fidaxomicin may be considered as first-line therapy for CDI.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25074856,

There are no head-to-head trials comparing these agents. To assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs for prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), we performed a network meta-analysis. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane-controlled trial register were searched, without language restriction, to identify trials. Studies were evaluated according to a priori inclusion criteria and appraised using established internal validity criteria. Adjusted indirect comparisons between agents were performed using well-established methods. RESULTS: Three trials meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Direct comparison between apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (BID) versus apixaban 5 mg BID showed no difference for any outcome. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred less with both apixaban 2.5 mg BID (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.62, P=0.004) and apixaban 5 mg BID [OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.82, P=0.019] compared to rivaroxaban 20 mg daily. Apixaban 2.5 mg BID showed less clinically relevant non-major bleeding than dabigatran 150 mg BID [OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.16-0.9, P=0.04], but not apixaban 5 mg BID. There were no differences between rivaroxaban 20 mg daily and dabigatran 150 mg BID. No differences in risk for recurrent VTE, major bleeding, or mortality were observed for any comparison between any pair of NOACs. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in risk for recurrent VTE, major bleeding, or all-cause mortality between the NOACs. However, apixaban 2.5 mg BID was associated with less clinically significant non-major bleeding than either rivaroxaban 20 mg daily or dabigatran 150 mg BID.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25056161,

All randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of targeted therapeutic drugs for mRCC were included. The study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. The analysis evaluated efficacy outcomes [improvement in the median progression-free survival (PFS)] and safety outcomes (number of withdrawals due to adverse events). The network analysis included direct and indirect analyses. The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method. We identified 7 articles eligible for inclusion in the study. The direct comparison of the targeted agents indicated better efficacy in terms of longer PFS, but worse safety (more withdrawals due to adverse events). The indirect analysis demonstrated that axitinib was significantly more effective compared to panzopanib; sunitinib was superior to sorafenib and temsirolimus regarding efficacy outcome, without any statistically significant difference in the safety outcome. The results of the quality assessment indicated moderate scores using the GRADE method. In conclusion, the result of this network analysis suggested that sunitinib and axitinib may be more clinically efficient and axitinib is associated with a lower risk of adverse events compared to sorafenib, pazopanib and temsirolimus.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",25054058,PMC4106731

Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated survival benefits for combination therapy compared to gemcitabine alone. However, the comparative benefits and harms of available combination chemotherapy treatments are not clear. We therefore conducted a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis to assess the comparative safety and efficacy of chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Registry of Clinical trials and abstracts from major scientific meetings were searched for RCTs published from 2002 to 2013. Key outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and safety including grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue and sensory neuropathy. Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted to calculate survival and safety outcomes using gemcitabine (GEM) as the reference comparator. Effect estimates and 95% credible intervals were calculated for each comparison. Mean ranks and the probability of being best were obtained for each treatment analyzed in the network meta-analysis. RESULTS: The search identified 23 studies involving 19 different treatment regimens and 9,989 patients. FOLFIRINOX, GEM/cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU (PEFG), GEM/NAB-paclitaxel (NAB-P), GEM/erlotinib+/-bevacizumab, GEM/capecitabine, and GEM/oxaliplatin were associated with statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS relative to gemcitabine alone and several other treatments. They were amongst the top ranked for survival outcomes amongst other treatments included. No significant differences were found for other combination chemotherapy treatments. Effect estimates from indirect comparisons matched closely to estimates derived from pairwise comparisons. Overall, combination therapies had greater risk for evaluated grade 3-4 toxicities over gemcitabine alone. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head comparisons, we performed a mixed-treatment analysis to achieve high-quality information on the effectiveness and safety of each treatment. This study suggests that some combination therapies may offer greater benefits in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer than others. To more fully elucidate the comparative benefits and harms of different combination chemotherapy regimens, rigorously conducted comparative studies, or network meta-analysis of patient-level data are required.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24972449,PMC4097092

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials evaluating the NVF relative risk reduction (RRR) with oral bisphosphonates or bazedoxifene were identified by a systematic literature review and combined by means of a network meta-analysis. A subgroup of patients with a FRAX score of 20% or more in the bazedoxifene phase III osteoporosis study was selected as the population of interest on the basis of the bazedoxifene label. In one analysis (analysis 1), the placebo response of the subgroup with a FRAX score of 20% or more was the benchmark to select comparable bisphosphonate trials. Additional analyses incorporated the aggregate data from the bisphosphonate trials with all the FRAX subgroups (analysis 2) or with the individual patient data from the bazedoxifene trial (analysis 3). RESULTS: Nine identified bisphosphonate trials (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate; N = 23,440 patients) with a similar placebo response as observed for the subgroup of high risk patients in the bazedoxifene trial were included in analysis 1. The results of the network meta-analysis of this study set suggest that bazedoxifene is expected to have an RRR of 0.43 (95% credible interval [CrI] -0.19 to 0.72) versus alendronate, 0.58 (95% CrI 0.05-0.81) versus ibandronate, and 0.39 (95% CrI -0.29 to 0.70) versus risedronate. Analyses in which treatment effects with bisphosphonates were projected to a population with a FRAX score of 20% or more with meta-regression approaches (analysis 2 and analysis 3) provide similar findings.

METHODS: A stepwise literature search specifically designed to identify indirect evidence was conducted to extend the original clinical review from the latest National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) VTE technology appraisal. Different network sizes or network orders, based on the successive searches, informed three network meta-analyses (NMAs), which were compared with a replicated base case. The resulting comparative estimates were inputted in an economic model to investigate the effect of network size on cost-effectiveness probabilities. RESULTS: Searches increased the number of indirect comparisons between VTE interventions, progressively widening the relevant network of studies for NMA. Precision around mean relative treatment effects was increased as the network was extended from the base case to first-order NMA, but further extensions had limited effect. Cost-effectiveness analysis results were largely insensitive to variation in clinical inputs from the different NMA orders. CONCLUSIONS: No standard methodology is currently recommended by NICE to identify the most relevant network of studies for NMA. Our study showed that optimizing the identification of studies for NMA can extend the evidence base for analysis and reduce the uncertainty in relative effectiveness estimates. Although in our example network extensions did not affect the acceptability of available treatments in VTE prevention based on cost-effectiveness results, it may in other applications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24969002,

While their effectiveness has not been directly compared in a clinical trial, results from the majority of the indirect treatment comparisons suggest comparable efficacy and safety profiles. However, these TNF inhibitor agents differ in administration method and dosing flexibility, which may result in differences in medication use profiles (e.g., adherence, persistence, discontinuation, dose escalation, and switching to a new biologic rheumatoid arthritis drug) and effectiveness in clinical practice.  OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of ADA, ETN, and IFX in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using a validated, claims-based algorithm designed for large retrospective databases. METHODS: Adult (aged 18-63 years) patients diagnosed with RA, and receiving ADA, ETN, or IFX, and insured by Texas Medicaid were included. The index date was the date of the first prescription claim for ADA or ETN or infusion record for IFX with no claim or infusion record of a biologic drug in the preceding 6 months (i.e., biologic naïve). The study time frame was from July 2003 to August 2011, and prescription and medical claims for each subject were analyzed over an 18-month period (6 months pre- and 12 months post-index). Based on a RA medication effectiveness algorithm (Curtis et al. 2011), a RA medication was classified as effective if each of the following 6 criteria were met: (1) high medication adherence (i.e., medication possession ratio [MPR] ≥ 80%, defined as the sum of days' supply for all fills or infusions divided by the number of days in the study period); (2) no switching to (or addition of) new biologic RA drugs; (3) no addition of new nonbiologic RA drugs; (4) no increase in dose or frequency of administration of the RA medication currently evaluated; (5) no more than 1 glucocorticoid (GC) joint injection; and (6) no increase in dose of a concurrent oral GC. Propensity score (PS) matching was employed, and paired tests (i.e., McNemar's) and multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis were used to compare groups. Demographic (i.e., age, gender, race) and clinical (i.e., use of nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], pain medication use, GC medication use, RA-related and non-RA-related health care visits [i.e., ambulatory and inpatient visits], number of nonstudy RA medications, and comorbidity index) characteristics, including total health care utilization cost at baseline, served as study covariates. RESULTS: After PS matching, 822 patients (n = 274 per group) were included. The majority of the sample (69.2%) was between 45-63 years, female (88%), and Hispanic (53.7%). Results for each TNF inhibitor differed significantly for 2 of the 6 effectiveness criteria (i.e., medication adherence and dose escalation). A significantly higher proportion of patients on IFX were adherent compared with patients on ETN or ADA (38.3% vs. 16.4% and 21.2%, P  less than  0.0001 for both). Adherence rates between ETN and ADA were not significantly different. A significantly higher (P  less than  0.0001) proportion of patients on ETN had no dose escalation compared with patients on ADA or IFX (98.2% vs. 88.7% and 80.3%, P  less than  0.0001). Dose escalation rate was also significantly lower (P = 0.0106) for ADA compared with IFX. The multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis indicated no significant difference in overall effectiveness using the claims-based algorithm among the 3 TNF inhibitors nor any significant relationship between effectiveness and the study covariates.  CONCLUSION: The study results suggest that when using a medication effectiveness algorithm, IFX, ETN, and ADA have comparable effectiveness in patients with RA. Patient adherence to therapy may be higher if given IFX, and patients who receive ETN are less likely to have a dose escalation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24967519,

DESIGN: Systematic review and indirect comparison meta-analysis. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, conference proceedings, trial registers and reference lists were searched up to October 2013 for randomized controlled trials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were patient satisfaction, re-intervention and complications rates, reproductive outcomes, and hospitalization and recovery times. RESULTS: Five trials, involving 436 women were included; two compared uterine artery embolization with myomectomy and three compared uterine artery embolization with laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion. Indirect treatment comparison showed that myomectomy and uterine artery embolization resulted in higher rates of patient satisfaction (odds ratio 2.56, 95% credible interval 0.56-11.75 and 2.7, 95% credible interval 1.1-7.14, respectively) and lower rates of clinical failure (odds ratio 0.29, 95% credible interval 0.06-1.46 and 0.37, 95% credible interval 0.13-0.93, respectively) than laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion. Myomectomy resulted in lower re-intervention rate than uterine artery embolization (odds ratio 0.08, 95% credible interval 0.02-0.27) and laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion (odds ratio 0.08, 95% credible interval 0.01-0.37) even though the latter techniques had an advantage over myomectomy because of shorter hospitalization and quicker recovery. There was no evidence of difference between the three techniques in ovarian failure and complications rates. The evidence for reproductive outcomes is poor. CONCLUSION: Our study's results suggest that laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion is less effective than uterine artery embolization and myomectomy in treatment of symptomatic fibroids. The choice between uterine artery embolization and myomectomy should be based on individuals' expectations and fully informed discussion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24909191,

Preservative-free (PF) latanoprost [Monoprost(®)] is a new formulation of latanoprost that is approved for use in the EU in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)/ocular hypertension. This article reviews the clinical pharmacology of this new formulation, focussing on its efficacy and tolerability in this indication. PF latanoprost was efficacious in reducing IOP in a randomized, investigator-masked, multinational trial in patients with POAG/ocular hypertension (n = 404). At days 15, 42 and 84 of follow-up, PF latanoprost was noninferior to benzalkonium chloride-preserved (BAK) latanoprost in terms of reductions in IOP. In this trial, at days 42 and 84 the proportions of patients with conjunctival hyperaemia were significantly lower with PF latanoprost than with BAK latanoprost. Patient subjective ratings of ocular symptoms were also significantly lower with PF latanoprost than with BAK latanoprost. In the absence of head-to-head comparisons with other anti-glaucoma drugs, an adjusted, indirect comparison meta-analysis was performed using data from 21 randomized clinical trials in patients with POAG/ocular hypertension. Based on this analysis, PF latanoprost had similar efficacy to different formulations of three comparator prostaglandin analogues in reducing the patient's IOP and was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing hyperaemia/ocular redness than these comparators. PF latanoprost offers a useful alternative to the available preserved prostaglandin analogues for the treatment of POAG/ocular hypertension.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24895141,

This also applies to a therapeutic context where investigators of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are interested in interactions between treatment assignment and one or more continuous predictors. METHODS/DESIGN: Our goal is to apply the multivariable fractional polynomial interaction (MFPI) approach to investigate interactions between continuous patient baseline variables and the allocated treatment in an individual patient data meta-analysis of three RCTs (N = 2,299) from the intensive care field. For each study, MFPI will provide a continuous treatment effect function. Functions from each of the three studies will be averaged by a novel meta-analysis approach for functions. We will plot treatment effect functions separately for each study and also the averaged function. The averaged function with a related confidence interval will provide a suitable basis to assess whether a continuous patient characteristic modifies the treatment comparison and may be relevant for clinical decision-making. The compared interventions will be a higher or lower positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation strategy in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. The continuous baseline variables body mass index, PaO2/FiO2, respiratory compliance, and oxygenation index will be the investigated potential effect modifiers. Clinical outcomes for this analysis will be in-hospital mortality, time to death, time to unassisted breathing, and pneumothorax. DISCUSSION: This project will be the first meta-analysis to combine continuous treatment effect functions derived by the MFPI procedure separately in each of several RCTs. Such an approach requires individual patient data (IPD). They are available from an earlier IPD meta-analysis using different methods for analysis. This new analysis strategy allows assessing whether treatment effects interact with continuous baseline patient characteristics and avoids categorization-based subgroup analyses. These interaction analyses of the present study will be exploratory in nature. However, they may help to foster future research using the MFPI approach to improve interaction analyses of continuous predictors in RCTs and IPD meta-analyses.

METHODS: Randomized trials comparing CIS-containing with non-CIS-containing chemotherapy regimens were identified in PubMed. Included studies were performed from 1990 to 2010, used SCr or CrCl as an eligibility criterion, and reported incidence of grade ≥3 nephrotoxicity for both treatment arms using World Health Organization (WHO) or National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity criteria. The relative risk (RR) of grade ≥3 nephrotoxicity associated with CIS versus non-CIS regimens was examined. Subgroup analyses, adjusted indirect comparison, and metaregression were used to compare SCr and CrCl. RESULTS: The literature search identified 2359 studies, 42 studies met all the inclusion criteria (N=9521 patients). SCr was used as an eligibility criterion in 20 studies (N=4704), CrCl was used in 9 studies (N=1650), and either was used in 13 studies (N=3167). The overall RR for developing nephrotoxicity with CIS versus non-CIS treatment was 1.75 (P=0.005). Subgroup analyses showed an increased risk when SCr was used (RR=2.60, P=0.005) but not when CrCl was used (RR=1.50, P=0.19). Both the adjusted indirect comparison and metaregression showed a nonsignificantly reduced risk of nephrotoxicity when CrCl was used. CONCLUSIONS: CIS-based therapy was associated with a significant increase in severe nephrotoxicity. The risk of severe nephrotoxicity appears to be lower when CrCl was used to determine whether people should be treated with CIS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24824144,

Initially, meta-analyses were proposed as a technique that could improve the accuracy and the statistical power of previous research from individual studies with small sample size. However, one of its main limitations has been the fact of being able to compare no more than two treatments in an analysis, even when the clinical research question necessitates that we compare multiple interventions. Network meta-analysis (NMA) uses novel statistical methods that incorporate information from both direct and indirect treatment comparisons in a network of studies examining the effects of various competing treatments, estimating comparisons between many treatments in a single analysis. Despite its potential limitations, NMA applications in clinical epidemiology can be of great value in situations where there are several treatments that have been compared against a common comparator. Also, NMA can be relevant to a research or clinical question when many treatments must be considered or when there is a mix of both direct and indirect information in the body of evidence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",24796656,PMC6985611

METHODS: Eight RCTs assessing vertebral fracture risk reduction with oral bisphosphonates (n = 7) or bazedoxifene (n = 1) were identified by a systematic literature review. Individual study results were pooled in a network meta-analysis (NMA) to indirectly compare treatment effects for overall PMO women and a higher-risk subgroup (FRAX ≥ 20%). Three sets of NMA analyses were conducted: aggregate data (AD) from the bisphosphonate RCTs and bazedoxifene RCT for the full population or the FRAX ≥20% subgroup (NMA AD); bisphosphonate AD and bazedoxifene AD from each FRAX subgroup adjusted for baseline risk (NMA AD meta-regression); and bisphosphonate AD and bazedoxifene individual patient data (IPD) adjusted for baseline risk/FRAX (NMA AD/IPD meta-regression). RESULTS: For the overall population, bisphosphonates had lower fracture risks versus bazedoxifene although there is considerable uncertainty in supporting one intervention over another. The relative risk reduction (RRR) for bazedoxifene was -0.23 (95% CrI: -1.11, 0.27) versus ibandronate, -0.17 (-0.76, 0.22) versus alendronate, and -0.06 (-0.62, 0.30) versus risedronate. RESULTS from the meta-regression analyses were similar. For the FRAX ≥20% population, estimated fracture rates with bazedoxifene were lower than with bisphosphonates, but again the uncertainty limits strong interpretation. The RRR for bazedoxifene was 0.51 (-0.31, 0.83) versus ibandronate, 0.53 (-0.18, 0.83) versus alendronate, and 0.57 (-0.07, 0.85) versus risedronate. The meta-regression analyses showed comparable findings. CONCLUSION: The analyses only considered vertebral fractures for oral bisphosphonates versus bazedoxifene, and IPD was available only for bazedoxifene. In light of this, bazedoxifene is comparable to bisphosphonates in the overall PMO population and at least as effective as bisphosphonates for preventing vertebral fractures among higher-risk PMO patients. The findings suggest bazedoxifene performs better in higher-risk PMO than in the overall PMO.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24773456,

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of NOACs for this indication. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search through November 2013 for randomized trials that evaluated treatment of acute VTE with a NOAC including rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban. Trials had to report at least one of the following outcomes of interest: mortality, recurrent VTE, recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or major bleeding. Included trials were evaluated for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We performed an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of NOACs, reporting relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals for each outcome. RESULTS: Six trials (n=27,069) met inclusion criteria, one each evaluating apixaban and edoxaban and two trials each evaluating rivaroxaban and dabigatran. Risk of bias was low for all trials. NOACS did not differ significantly in the risk of mortality, recurrent VTE, recurrent PE or recurrent DVT. Dabigatran increased major bleeding risk compared to apixaban [RR 2.69 (1.19 to 6.07)] as did edoxaban compared to apixaban [RR 2.74 (1.40 to 5.39)]. CONCLUSION: Although NOACs do not appear to differ in the efficacy of treating acute VTE, data suggests apixaban to be the safer than some of its competitors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24713109,

OBJECTIVE: To conduct an overview of existing evaluations of quality of reporting in network meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons, and to compile a list of topics which may require detailed reporting guidance to enhance future reporting quality. METHODS: An electronic search of Medline and the Cochrane Registry of methodologic studies (January 2004-August 2013) was performed by an information specialist. Studies describing findings from quality of reporting assessments were sought. Screening of abstracts and full texts was performed by two team members. Descriptors related to all aspects of reporting a network meta-analysis were summarized. RESULTS: We included eight reports exploring the quality of reporting of network meta-analyses. From past reviews, authors found several aspects of network meta-analyses were inadequately reported, including primary information about literature searching, study selection, and risk of bias evaluations; statement of the underlying assumptions for network meta-analysis, as well as efforts to verify their validity; details of statistical models used for analyses (including information for both Bayesian and Frequentist approaches); completeness of reporting of findings; and approaches for summarizing probability measures as additional important considerations. CONCLUSIONS: While few studies were identified, several deficiencies in the current reporting of network meta-analyses were observed. These findings reinforce the need to develop reporting guidance for network meta-analyses.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review and quantify the global risk of dyspnea of recent P2Y₁₂ inhibitor drugs, and evaluate its association with the reversibility profile of P2Y₁₂ inhibitors. METHODS: A database search (March 2013) retrieved randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing new antiplatelet drugs (ticagrelor, prasugrel, cangrelor, elinogrel) with clopidogrel. The primary outcome was the incidence of dyspnea. Placebo-controlled trials were excluded. Meta-analysis was performed and estimates were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Dyspnea incidence was evaluated according to the reversibility profile of P2Y₁₂ antagonists. RESULTS: We found eight RCTs including 41,289 patients. Prasugrel was not associated with an increased risk of dyspnea (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93-1.27), whereas ticagrelor (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.37-2.77), cangrelor (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.36-4.33), and elinogrel (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.57-6.72) showed an increased risk of dyspnea.

In chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP), however, their use is controversial. Previous meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) lack methodological homogeneity and comparable data. Here we analysed the maximum analgesic efficacies of opioids and non-opioids compared with placebo, and of physiotherapy and psychotherapy compared with active or waiting-list controls. We screened 3647 citations and included RCTs if treatment duration was at least 3 weeks, data were sufficient for meta-analysis, and criteria for high quality were met. Only 46 studies (10 742 patients) met the criteria. Weighted and standardized mean differences (WMD, SMD) between pain intensities were pooled to conduct separate meta-analyses for each treatment category. At the end of treatment the WMD for pain reduction (100-point scale) was 12.0 for 'strong' opioids, 10.6 for 'weak' opioids, 8.4 for non-opioids (each vs. placebo), 5.5 for psychotherapy and 4.5 for physiotherapy (each vs. active controls). Dropout rates were high in pharmacological studies. The 95% confidence intervals using the outcomes of control groups did not indicate statistical differences between efficacies of the five interventions. Because not enough eligible head-to-head trials were available, our analysis is limited to adjusted indirect comparisons. The heterogeneity of pre-post pain differences in control groups did not allow the definition of a common comparator. In conclusion, although there were statistically significant differences between maximum treatment efficacies, no intervention per se produced clinically important improvements in average pain intensity. Thus, opioids alone are inappropriate and multimodal treatment programmes may be required for CNCP.

The Task Force developed a consensus-based 26-item questionnaire to help decision makers assess the relevance and credibility of indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis to help inform health care decision making. The relevance domain of the questionnaire (4 questions) calls for assessments about the applicability of network meta-analysis results to the setting of interest to the decision maker. The remaining 22 questions belong to an overall credibility domain and pertain to assessments about whether the network meta-analysis results provide a valid answer to the question they are designed to answer by examining 1) the used evidence base, 2) analysis methods, 3) reporting quality and transparency, 4) interpretation of findings, and 5) conflicts of interest. The questionnaire aims to help readers of network meta-analysis opine about their confidence in the credibility and applicability of the results of a network meta-analysis, and help make decision makers aware of the subtleties involved in the analysis of networks of randomized trial evidence. It is anticipated that user feedback will permit periodic evaluation and modification of the questionnaire.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,no_paitc",24636374,

POPULATION: children and adolescents. SETTING: Europe. Comparators: methylphenidate (MPH), atomoxetine (ATX), and dexamphetamine (DEX). Electronic databases and relevant conference proceedings were searched for randomized, controlled clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety of at least one of the comparators and LDX. Quality assessments for each included trial were performed using criteria recommended by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Network meta-analysis methods for dichotomous outcomes were employed to evaluate treatment efficacy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response, as defined by either a reduction from baseline of at least 25% in the ADHD Rating Scale [ADHD-RS] total score or, separately, as assessed on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement [CGI-I] scale, and safety (all-cause withdrawals and withdrawal due to adverse events). RESULTS: The systematic review found 32 trials for the meta-analysis, including data on LDX, ATX, and different formulations of MPH. No trials for DEX meeting the inclusion criteria were found. Sufficient data were identified for each outcome: ADHD-RS, 16 trials; CGI-I, 20 trials; all-cause withdrawals, 28 trials; and withdrawals due to adverse events, 27 trials. The relative probability of treatment response for CGI-I (95% confidence intervals [CI]) for ATX versus LDX was 0.65 (0.53-0.78); for long-acting MPH versus LDX, 0.82 (0.69-0.97); for intermediate release MPH versus LDX, 0.51 (0.40-0.65); and for short-acting MPH versus LDX, 0.62 (0.51-0.76). The relative probabilities of ADHD-RS treatment response also favored LDX. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of ADHD, the synthesis of efficacy data showed statistically significant better probabilities of response with LDX than for formulations of MPH or ATX. The analysis of safety data proved inconclusive due to low event rates. These results may be limited by the studies included, which only investigated the short-term efficacy of medications in patients without comorbid disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24627974,

We aimed to assess whether alternative treatment options such as rivaroxaban or apixaban carry a similar risk as compared with dabigatran. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials of apixaban, dabigatran or rivaroxaban against control (placebo, heparin or vitamin K antagonist). We pooled odds ratios (OR) for adverse coronary events (acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction) using fixed effect meta-analysis and assessed heterogeneity with I(2) . We conducted adjusted indirect comparisons to compare risk of adverse coronary events with apixaban or rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran. RESULTS: Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Dabigatran was associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse coronary events in pooled analysis of nine trials (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.14, 1.86). There was no signal for coronary risk with apixaban from nine trials (pooled OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or rivaroxaban from nine trials (pooled OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72, 0.93). Overall, adjusted indirect comparison suggested that both apixaban (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44, 0.85) and rivaroxaban (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.39, 0.76) were associated with lower coronary risk than dabigatran. Restricting the indirect comparison to a vitamin K antagonist as a common control, yielded similar findings, OR 0.57 (95% CI 0.39, 0.85) for apixaban vs. dabigatran and 0.53 (95% CI 0.37, 0.77) for rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the comparative safety of apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran with regards to acute coronary adverse events.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24617578,PMC4239965

METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of a biologic plus MTX vs. MTX alone. We examined several clinical factors and patient characteristics potentially associated with magnitude of response, measured as ACR20 (20% improvement in ACR criteria) and ACR50 (16-26 weeks). We employed meta-regression for formal estimates and statistical significance of effect modification. We produced regression and forest plots to further inspect potential associations. RESULTS: For ACR50, a 1-year increment on the average patient disease duration was statistically significantly associated with a 16% relative increase in the pooled odds ratio (OR) estimate (P = 0.003). A 1-year increment in patient age and a 1 mg/week increment in MTX dose were marginally statistically significantly associated with a 9% (P = 0.056) and 22% (P = 0.092) relative increase in the OR. For ACR20, the average number of swollen and tender joints was marginally statistically associated with a 3% relative decrease. The associations for age and MTX dose appeared to be partly driven by significant negative associations between these two factors and the control group response. CONCLUSION: Our analyses identified key variables associated with the magnitude of comparative effects for ACR outcomes. Our findings provide valuable insights for future trial designs and systematic reviews as well as decision-making and clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24599922,

METHODS: Two comprehensive meta-analyses with similar control arms (conventionally fractionated RT) were compared indirectly. RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) of death with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the overall comparison of altered fractionation RT with concomitant CRT was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.97-1.29; p = .07) suggesting no significant difference between both approaches. Compared to concomitant CRT, the HR for death was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.89-1.15; p = .82); 1.22 (95% CI, 0.94-1.59; p = .13); and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.07-1.39; p = .002) for hyperfractionated RT; accelerated RT without total dose reduction; and accelerated RT with total dose reduction, respectively. CONCLUSION: Concomitant CRT and hyperfractionated RT are comparable to one another on indirect comparison in the radiotherapeutic management of locoregionally advanced HNSCC. Any form of acceleration (with or without total dose reduction) may not compensate fully for lack of chemotherapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24596112,

METHODS: PubMed, the Cochrane library, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched to find randomized controlled trials [RCTs]. Direct pair-wise meta analysis (DMA), indirect treatment comparison meta analysis (ITC) and NMA were conducted to compare different kinds of LC. RESULTS: We included 43 RCTs. The risk of bias of included studies was high. DMA showed that SPLC was associated with more postoperative complications, longer operative time, and higher cosmetic score than 4PLC, longer operative time and higher cosmetic score than 3PLC, more postoperative complications than mini-4PLC. Mini-4PLC was associated with longer operative time than 4PLC. ITC showed that 3PLC was associated with shorter operative time than mini-4PLC, and lower postoperative pain level than 2PLC. 2PLC was associated with fewer postoperative complications and longer hospital stay than SPLC. NMA showed that SPLC was associated with more postoperative complications than mini-4PLC, and longer operative time than 4PLC. CONCLUSION: The rank probability plot suggested 4PLC might be the worst due to the highest level of postoperative pain, longest hospital stay, and lowest level of cosmetic score. The best one might be mini-4PLC because of highest level of cosmetic score, and fewest postoperative complications, or SPLC because of lowest level of postoperative pain and shortest hospital stay. But more studies are needed to determine which will be better between mini-4PLC and SPLC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Read, because talk about \""meta-analysis indirect comparison\"" and NMA""]}",24587319,PMC3938681

METHODS: PubMed (1966-2011.12), the Cochrane Library (2011 Issue 2) and EMBASE (1974-2011.12) were searched with the terms ""gastric cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"", as well as the medical subject headings. References from relevant articles and conferences were also included. Patients who had previous gastric surgery, radiation before or after surgery or chemotherapy before surgery were excluded. In this study, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered, and the end-point was the overall mortality. Direct comparisons were performed using traditional meta-analysis whereas indirect comparisons were performed using network meta-analysis. RESULTS: In total, 31 RCTs with 7120 patients were included. Five chemotherapy regimens, fluorouracil (FU) + BCNU, FU + methyl-CCNU (mCCNU), FU + cisplatin, FU + anthracyclines and FU + mitomycin c (MMC) + cytarabine (Ara-c), were found to be less beneficial in terms of overall mortality. In contrast, four chemotherapy regimens were effective for the patients after surgery, including FU + MMC + adriamycin (FMA), FU + MMC (FM), Tegafur and MMC, There was no significant difference in terms of overall mortality among these regimens. The evidence for the FM regimen and MMC regimen was poor. Additionally, the FMA regimen, which includes a variety of chemotherapy drugs and causes many side effects, was not better than the Tegafur regimen. CONCLUSION: Although the four chemotherapy regimens were effective in patients with gastric cancer after surgery and the overall mortality revealed no significant difference among them in the network meta-analysis, thorough analysis of the results recommends Tegafur as the first-line adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients after complete resection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24574729,PMC3923035

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban against other NOACs from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Services. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic impact of apixaban versus other NOACs over a lifetime. Pair-wise indirect treatment comparisons were conducted against other NOACs by using ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation), RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy), and ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) trial results for the following end points: ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeds, myocardial infarction, and treatment discontinuations. Outcomes were life-years, quality-adjusted life years gained, direct health care costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Apixaban was projected to increase life expectancy versus other NOACs, including dabigatran (both doses) and rivaroxaban. A small increase in therapeutic management costs was observed with apixaban due to projected gains in life expectancy and lower discontinuation rates anticipated on apixaban versus other NOACs through lifetime. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £9611, £4497, and £5305 per quality-adjusted life-year gained with apixaban compared with dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust over a wide range of inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Although our analysis was limited by the absence of head-to-head trials, based on the indirect comparison data available, our model projects that apixaban may be a cost-effective alternative to dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for stroke prevention in AF patients from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Services.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24508420,

Both are burdened, however, by toxicity that could contribute to perioperative morbidity and mortality. METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and Embase were searched to capture the incidence of any postoperative complications, cardiac complications, respiratory complications, anastomotic leakage, postoperative 30-day mortality, total postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality in randomized clinical trials comparing NAC or NACR with surgery alone, or NAC versus NACR. Meta-analyses comparing NAC and NACR were conducted by using adjusted indirect comparison. RESULTS: Twenty-three relevant studies were identified. Comparing NAC or NACR with surgery alone, there was no increase in morbidity or mortality attributable to neoadjuvant therapy. Subgroup analysis of NACR for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) suggested an increased risk of total postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality compared with surgery alone: risk ratio 1·95 (95 per cent confidence interval 1·06 to 3·60; P = 0·032) and 1·97 (1·07 to 3·64; P = 0·030) respectively. A combination of direct comparison and adjusted indirect comparison showed no difference between NACR and NAC regarding morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION: Neither NAC nor NACR for oesophageal carcinoma increases the risk of postoperative morbidity or perioperative mortality compared with surgery alone. There was no clear difference between NAC and NACR. Care should be taken with NACR in oesophageal SCC, where an increased risk of postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality was apparent.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24493117,

METHODS: A systematic review and Bayesian indirect treatment comparison meta-analyses were performed for seven patient-important clinical outcomes at 8 weeks and 52 weeks. Odds ratio (OR) estimates and associated 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were produced. RESULTS: Five eligible RCTs informed clinical remission, response, mucosal healing, quality of life, colectomy, serious adverse events, and discontinuation due to adverse events at 8 weeks and 52 weeks. At 8 weeks of induction therapy, clinical remission (OR=0.42, 95% CrI 0.17-0.97), clinical response (OR=0.45, 95% CrI 0.23-0.89) and mucosal healing (OR=0.46, 95% CrI 0.25-0.86) statistically favored infliximab. However, after 52 weeks of maintenance therapy OR estimates showed no significant difference between infliximab and adalimumab. For serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, adalimumab and infliximab were similar to placebo. Further, the indirect treatment comparison of adalimumab and infliximab yielded odds ratios close to 1.00 with wide credible intervals. CONCLUSION: The findings of this indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis suggest that both infliximab and adalimumab are superior to placebo in the treatment of moderate to moderately severe ulcerative colitis. While infliximab is statistically more effective than adalimumab in the induction of remission, response and mucosal healing at 8 weeks, infliximab and adalimumab are comparable in efficacy at 52 weeks of maintenance treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24491514,

METHODS: A systematic search identified six randomised controlled trials (amlodipine/losartan-3, amlodipine/valsartan-3) of FDCs and their component monotherapies. Conventional fixed-effects methods were used to conduct the comparisons. The primary and secondary effect measures were the changes in sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure (sitDBP, sitSBP) at 8 weeks post-randomisation. RESULTS: The estimated amlodipine/valsartan - amlodipine/losartan difference (95% confidence interval) in sitDBP reduction was -1.27 mmHg, (-5.7, 2.2) for lower dosages and -0.45 mmHg, (-3.7, 2.7) for higher dosages; for sitSBP, the values were -3.74 mmHg, (-9.0, 2.9) for lower dosages and 0.2 mmHg, (-6.2, 6.0) for higher dosages. The confidence of a greater reduction in BP (fixed difference = 0) on amlodipine/losartan 5/50 than on amlodipine/valsartan 5/80 was 77% for sitDBP and 89% for sitSBP. The corresponding confidence for the higher doses was 61% for sitDBP and 48% for sitSBP. The findings support asserting with (fixed) 95% confidence that the BP reduction on amlodipine/valsartan 5/80 exceeds the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 reduction by at most 1.6 mmHg for sitDBP, and at most 1.26 mmHg for sitSBP. The corresponding upper bounds for the higher dosages were 2.31 mmHg (sitDBP) and 5.38 mmHg (sitSBP). CONCLUSIONS: The BP lowering effect with amlodipine/losartan and amlodipine/valsartan was comparable. Potential superiority of the reductions realised with amlodipine/valsartan relative to amlodipine/losartan, are unlikely to be clinically material.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24460615,

METHODS: A patient-level simulation was adapted from the model used by the University of Sheffield School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) in a health technology appraisal of rituximab for first-line treatment of follicular lymphoma. This approach allowed modelling of the complex treatment pathways in indolent NHL. Data from a Phase 3 randomized, open-label trial were used to compare B-R with CHOP-R. The relative efficacy of CHOP-R and CVP-R was estimated using an indirect treatment comparison similar to the original ScHARR approach. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales, using a lifetime time horizon. A number of one-way sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted, including one using recently published data comparing CVP-R with CHOP-R. RESULTS: The deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £5249 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for B-R vs CHOP-R, and £8092 per QALY for B-R vs CVP-R. The alternative scenario using direct data comparing CVP-R with CHOP-R approximately halved the ICER for B-R vs CVP-R to £4733. Owing to its better toxicity profile, B-R reduced the cost of treating adverse events by over £1000 per patient vs CHOP-R. LIMITATIONS: The main limitations were: immaturity of overall survival data from the Phase 3 trial; reliance on quality-of-life data from previous health technology appraisals (as this was not collected in the trial); and a lack of direct evidence or a network of connected evidence comparing B-R with CVP-R. CONCLUSIONS: The ICERs for B-R vs CHOP-R and CVP-R were considerably below the thresholds normally regarded as cost-effective in England and Wales (£20,000-30,000 per QALY).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read,FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",24308372,

METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Novartis clinical trial database were searched through December 2012 for reports of randomized controlled trials of aliskiren/amlodpine and aliskiren/HCTZ vs. monotherapy in patients with hypertension. The main outcome measures were reduction in systolic BP and diastolic BP from baseline and rates of therapeutic response and BP control. Tolerance of aliskiren/amlodipine and aliskiren/HCTZ was also analyzed. Outcomes were initially pooled by standard random-effects methods, producing a weighted mean difference (WMD) or risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The pooled estimates were then used for adjusted indirect comparisons. RESULTS: We selected 19 reports of trials involving 13,614 participants. Aliskiren/amlodpine and aliskiren/HCTZ were more effective than monotherapy in controlling BP. Aliskiren/amlodipine was significantly more effective than aliskiren/HCTZ in reducing systolic BP (WMD = -3.36 mm Hg; 95% CI = -4.64 to 2.07 mm Hg) and diastolic BP (WMD = -3.49 mm Hg; 95% CI = -4.34 to 2.63 mm Hg). As compared with aliskiren/HCTZ, alikiren/amlodipine was associated with higher rate of therapeutic response (RR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.14-1.33) and BP control (RR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.11-1.39). Number of adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events were similar with aliskiren/amlodipine and aliskiren/HCTZ. CONCLUSIONS: BP control is better with aliskiren combined with amlodipine or HCTZ than with monotherapy, with aliskiren/amlodipine being more effective than aliskiren/HCTZ.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24304656,

DESIGN. Indirect treatment comparison and a cost-effectiveness assessment. SETTING: Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Those having epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Erlotinib versus gefitinib use was compared on the basis of four relevant Asian phase-III randomised controlled trials: one for erlotinib (OPTIMAL) and three for gefitinib (IPASS; NEJGSG; WJTOG). The cost-effectiveness assessment model simulates the transition between the health states: progression-free survival, progression, and death over a lifetime horizon. The World Health Organization criterion (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <3 times of gross domestic product/capita: <US$102 582; approximately <HK$798 078) was used to rate cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The best fit of study characteristics and prognostic patient characteristics were found between the OPTIMAL and IPASS trials. Comparing progression-free survival hazard ratios of erlotinib versus gefitinib using only these randomised controlled trials in an indirect treatment comparison resulted in a statistically significant progression-free survival difference in favour of erlotinib (indirect treatment comparison hazard ratio=0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.58; P=0.0001). The cost-effectiveness assessment model showed that the cost per progression-free life year gained and per quality-adjusted life year gained was at acceptable values of US$39 431 (approximately HK$306 773) and US$62 419 (approximately HK$485 619) for erlotinib versus gefitinib, respectively. CONCLUSION: The indirect treatment comparison of OPTIMAL versus IPASS shows that erlotinib is significantly more efficacious than gefitinib. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness assessment indicates that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are well within an acceptable range in relation to the survival benefits obtained. In conclusion, erlotinib is cost-effective compared to gefitinib for first-line epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24281768,

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of New Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) to warfarin in patients with AF and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). METHODS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including total 14527 patients, comparing NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban) with warfarin were included in the analysis. Primary efficacy endpoint was ischemic stroke, and primary safety endpoint was intracranial bleeding. Random-effects models were used to pool efficacy and safety data across RCTs. RevMan and Stata software were used for direct and indirect comparisons, respectively. RESULTS: In patients with AF and previous stroke or TIA, effects of NOACs were not statistically different from that of warfarin, in reduction of stroke (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73- 1.01), disabling and fatal stroke (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71-1.04), and all-cause mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 -1.02). Randomization to NOACs was associated with a significantly lower risk of intracranial bleeding (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.25-0.70). There were no major differences in efficacy between apixaban, dabigatran (110 mg BID and 150 mg BID) and rivaroxaban. Major bleeding was significantly lower with apixaban and dabigatran (110 mg BID) compared with dabigatran (150 mg BID) and rivaroxaban. CONCLUSION: NOACs may not be more effective than warfarin in the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with a prior history of cerebrovascular ischemia, but have a lower risk of intracranial bleeding.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24204920,PMC3808395

This might be attributable to β1-selective blockers. INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to determine by meta-analysis whether β-adrenergic blockers (BBs) reduce fracture risk and whether the effect, if demonstrable, is dependent upon selectivity, dose, gender, or fracture site. METHODS: A literature search was performed in electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and reference sections of relevant articles to identify eligible studies. Adjusted estimates of fracture risk effect size (ES) were pooled across studies using fixed or random-effects (RE) meta-analysis as appropriate. Dose-related effects were evaluated using meta-regression. To explore the relative efficacy of β1-selective blockers in comparison to nonselective BBs, adjusted indirect comparison was performed. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies (7 cohort and 9 case-control studies), involving 1,644,570 subjects, were identified. The risk of any fracture was found to be significantly reduced in subjects receiving BBs as compared to control subjects (16 studies, RE pooled ES = 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.93; I(2) = 87 %). In a sensitivity analysis limited to those studies deemed to be most robust, the BB effect to reduce fracture risk was sustained (four studies, pooled ES = 0.79, 95% CI 0.67-0.94; I(2) = 96%). The risk of a hip fracture was lower in both women and men receiving BBs (women: pooled ES = 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.91; I(2) = 1% and men: pooled ES = 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.90; I(2) = 0%). Similar risk reductions were found for clinical vertebral and forearm fractures, although statistical significance was not reached. The reduction in risk did not appear to be dose-related (test for a linear trend p value 0.150). Using adjusted indirect comparisons, it was estimated that β1-selective agents were significantly more effective than nonselective BBs in reducing the risk of any fracture (six studies, β1-selective blockers vs. nonselective BBs: RE pooled ES = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.69-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the risk of fracture is approximately 15% lower in patients treated with BBs compared to controls independent of gender, fracture site, and dose. This risk reduction might be associated with the effects of β1-selective blockers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_original_article",24114396,

METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched for opioid publications between September 1, 2001 and August 31, 2011, and pivotal clinical trials from all years; abstracts from key pain conferences (2010-2011) were also reviewed. One hundred and ninety-one publications were initially identified, 68 of which met eligibility criteria and were systematically reviewed; a subset of 16 involved a placebo group (13 non-ADFs vs placebo, 3 ADFs vs placebo) and reported both efficacy and safety outcomes, and were included for a meta-analysis. Summary estimates of standardized difference in mean change of pain intensity (DMCPI), standardized difference in sum of pain intensity difference (DSPID), and odds ratios (ORs) of each adverse event (AE) were computed through random-effects estimates for ADFs (and non-ADFs) vs placebo. Indirect treatment comparisons were conducted to compare ADFs and non-ADFs. RESULTS: Summary estimates for standardized DMCPI and for standardized DSPID indicated that ADFs and non-ADFs showed significantly greater efficacy than placebo in reducing pain intensity. Indirect analyses assessing the efficacy outcomes between ADFs and non-ADFs indicated that they were not significantly different (standardized DMCPI [0.39 {95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00-0.76}]; standardized DSPID [-0.22 {95% CI -0.74 to 0.30}]). ADFs and non-ADFs both were associated with higher odds of AEs than placebo. Odds ratios from indirect analyses comparing AEs for ADFs vs non-ADFs were not significant (nausea, 0.87 [0.24-3.12]; vomiting, 1.54 [0.40-5.97]; dizziness/vertigo, 0.61 [0.21-1.76]; headache, 1.42 [0.57-3.53]; somnolence/drowsiness, 0.47 [0.09-2.58]; constipation, 0.64 [0.28-1.49]; pruritus 0.41 [0.05-3.51]).

METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAT versus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT), followed by a manual search. Then, a meta-analysis of RCTs comparing TAT versus standard DAT in patients undergoing PCI was performed. Furthermore, indirect comparisons of TAT versus new generation ADP-receptor antagonist based DAT (prasugrel or ticagrelor based DAT) were undertaken, with standard DAT as a common comparator. The included end-points were major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), death, myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, bleeding and other drug adverse events. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs with a total of 31,789 patients were included. Compared with standard DAT (n = 2551), TAT (n = 2545) significantly reduced the incidence of MACE (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.47-0.68, P < 0.00001), TLR (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.34-0.75, P = 0.0006) and TVR (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.46-0.75, P < 0.0001), and did not change significantly in death (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.44-1.05, P = 0.08), MI (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.45-1.44, P = 0.46), stent thrombosis (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.27-1.36, P = 0.23), major bleeding (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 0.52-3.85, P = 0.49) and overall bleeding (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.79-1.69, P = 0.45). Compared with prasugrel (n = 6813) or ticagrelor based DAT (n = 6732), TAT (n = 2545) further reduced the incidence of MACE (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.72-0.90, P = 0.0012; OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75-0.92, P = 0.0003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with standard DAT, the long-term use of TAT in patients with PCI gives more benefits in reducing the incidence of MACE, TLR and TVR without increasing bleeding. Furthermore, it might be superior to prasugrel or ticagrelor based DAT in term of MACE, which needs to be confirmed by future studies with direct comparisons.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24083626,

Efficacy and safety were estimated using a common-reference based indirect comparison meta-analysis (CRBMA) methodology. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of IV-VPA or IV-PB versus intravenous phenytoin (IV-PHT) for GCSE were identified by a systematic search of the literature. A random effects model was used to estimate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs) for efficacy and safety of IV-VPA or IV-PB versus IV-PHT in a standard meta-analysis. Adjusted indirect comparisons were then made between VPA and PB using the obtained results. RESULTS: CRBMA showed that VPA does not lead to significantly higher seizure cessation (OR 1.00; 95% CI: 0.36-2.76) compared to PB, although it exhibits fewer adverse effects (OR 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04-0.71). Results of this CRBMA are consistent with results of a recently published head-to-head comparison of IV-VPA and IV-PB. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate superiority of IV-VPA over IV-PB for the treatment of GCSE in terms of efficacy. Some direct and indirect comparisons suggest that VPA has a better safety profile than PB. However, the limited numbers of underpowered RCTs included in this meta-analysis are not sufficient to justify a change in clinical practice. More rigorous and appropriately powered RCTs are therefore required to definitively determine the efficacy and tolerability of VPA for the treatment of GCSE.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",23981687,

However, other study designs or methods could be used to indirectly compare these two medications. Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) is a recent methodology that utilizes individual patient data (IPD) from clinical trials for one treatment and published aggregate data from another treatment to estimate the relative efficacy of both, providing rapid, reliable comparative efficacy results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of GXR and ATX for the treatment of ADHD using MAIC. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify ATX and GXR trials published through December 2012. Studies were selected for MAIC analyses on the basis of having comparable trial characteristics and study designs. Summary data from selected ATX trials and IPD from selected GXR trials were used. MAIC methodology ensured comparable populations: target doses for the 'base case' comparison were selected on the basis of maximum effective dosage ranges from the US FDA-approved product labels (GXR 0.09-0.12 mg/kg/day, ATX 1.2 mg/kg/day for children and adolescents weighing ≤70 kg). Individuals from GXR trials were selected if they matched inclusion/exclusion criteria from selected ATX trials; selected GXR IPD were then re-weighted to match the published ATX trial mean baseline characteristics and placebo outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted, examining different dosage ranges and repeating the analysis in a larger number of trials, allowing for larger and more heterogeneous trial populations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was change in ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score. RESULTS: Using MAIC in the base case comparison, significantly greater reductions in mean (standard error; SE) ADHD-RS-IV total scores from baseline to end of study were observed in patients treated with GXR relative to ATX [-7.0 (2.2); p < 0.01]. Significantly greater reductions for GXR over ATX were also demonstrated for hyperactivity/impulsivity [-3.8 (1.2); p < 0.01] and inattention [-3.2 (1.3); p < 0.05] subscales of the ADHD-RS-IV. Similar results were observed in MAIC sensitivity analyses evaluating other dosage ranges and using more heterogeneous trial populations (e.g., larger randomized sample, broader subject weight range, additional trials). Mean (SE) decreases in ADHD-RS-IV total scores were greater for GXR relative to ATX when including IPD for those administered GXR at lower than target dosage (0.075-0.090 mg/kg/day) compared with ATX at target dosage (1.2 mg/kg/day), with a relative improvement of -6.0 (2.7) (p < 0.05). Reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores were also greater for GXR in another MAIC examining GXR at target dosage (0.09-0.12 mg/kg/day) and a broader range of ATX dosages (including three additional trials evaluating ATX ≥1.2 mg/kg/day); relative improvement for GXR versus ATX administered at target dosage or higher was -7.6 (1.4) (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: After adjusting for difference in baseline trial characteristics using MAIC, GXR appears to be more efficacious than ATX for the treatment of ADHD. Results were consistent in a variety of dosage range comparisons and within increasingly heterogeneous trial populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",23975660,PMC3824845

METHODS: Existing institutional guidance for conducting indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison alongside current practice in health technology assessment was reviewed. Reports published in UK by the Health Technology Assessment programme since 1997, which utilized indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison methods, were reviewed with respect to the presentation of study data, statistical models and results. Recommendations for presentation were developed. RESULTS: Guidance exists that provide the details necessary to conduct a successful indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison analysis but recommendations on presentation are limited. Of 205 health technology assessment reports that contained evidence synthesis for effectiveness, 19 used indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison methods. These reports utilized numerous presentational formats from which the following key components were identified: network table/diagram for presenting data; model description to allow reproducibility; and tables, forest plots, matrix tables and summary forest plots for presenting a range of results. Recommendations were developed to ensure that reporting is explicit, transparent and reproducible. Approaches most understandable by non-technical decision makers, and areas where future research is required, are outlined. CONCLUSIONS: There is no standard presentational style used in UK for reporting indirect comparison/mixed treatment comparison, and the use of graphical tools is limited.

The primary endpoint was target lesion revascularization (TLR); secondary endpoints were restenosis, death and amputation. RESULTS: In total, 1464 patients were assigned to revascularization with PCB versus UCB (n = 441) or BNS versus UCB (n = 1023). Treatment with PCB versus UCB reduced the risk of TLR (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.29 [0.15-0.56], p < 0.001) and restenosis (0.31 [0.19-0.51], p < 0.001) without affecting mortality (1.05 [0.41-2.71], p = 0.92) or amputation (0.68 [0.04-10.31], p = 0.78).

There are inherent challenges with both treatments, including variable and inconsistent benefit and increased bleeding risks. The availability of new anticoagulants offers some alternatives. OBJECTIVE: A mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis to evaluate direct and indirect treatment data including aspirin, warfarin apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban for the prevention of primary or secondary stroke in patients with AF. METHODS: A comprehensive, systematic literature search was conducted to identify randomized trials comparing aspirin, warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in patients with AF requiring treatment for stroke prevention. Open-label and blinded designs were included if they evaluated any stroke or any bleeding event. Data on stroke and bleeding events were abstracted, verified, evaluated, scored, and entered into Aggregate Data Drug Information System version 1.16 to generate a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. Direct and indirect comparisons were evaluated, and we looked for inconsistency in closed loop structures. Data are reported as rate ratios with 95% credible intervals. In addition, we reviewed variance statistics and explored variance with node-splitting models. RESULTS: Our literature search yielded 30 articles, 21 of which were included. All treatments except aspirin reduced the risk of any stroke compared with placebo. Warfarin (0.43 [0.33-0.57]), apixaban (0.37 [0.27-0.54]), dabigatran (0.34 [0.21-0.57]), rivaroxaban (0.36 [0.22-0.60]), and aspirin with clopidogrel (0.73 [0.53-0.99]) were more protective than aspirin alone. Warfarin and the new anticoagulants were similar in the reduction of stroke, vascular death, and mortality. There was no difference in major bleeding between any treatment group. There were more nonmajor bleeding events when comparing warfarin and apixaban (1.83 [1.05-4.03]); no other differences between warfarin and the other new anticoagulants were found. CONCLUSIONS: This mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis found similarity between warfarin and the new anticoagulants with the exception of one comparison, in which warfarin was associated with more non-major bleeding than apixaban. Thus, the new anticoagulants are therapeutically comparable when warfarin is inappropriate.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",23870607,

As the number of ITC and MTC meta-analyses increase, it is common to find multiple analyses evaluating the same interventions in similar therapeutic areas. Depending on the choice of the methodological approach, the conclusions about relative treatment efficacy may differ. Such situations create uncertainty for decision makers. An illustration of this is provided by four ITC and MTC meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of boceprevir and telaprevir for chronic hepatitis C virus infection.

Both dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole are an enantiomer of lansoprazole and omeprazole respectively. However, there is no head-to-head trial data or indirect comparison analyses between dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole. AIM: To compare the efficacy of dexlansoprazole with esomeprazole in healing erosive oesophagitis (EO), the maintenance of healed EO and the treatment of non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). METHODS: Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing dexlansoprazole or esomeprazole with either placebo or another PPI were systematically reviewed. Random-effect meta-analyses and adjusted indirect comparisons were conducted to compare the treatment effect of dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole using a common comparator. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: The indirect comparisons revealed significant differences in symptom control of heartburn in patients with NERD at 4 weeks. Dexlansoprazole 30 mg was more effective than esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg (RR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.15-3.51; RR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.39-3.38). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two drugs in EO healing and maintenance of healed EO. Comparison of symptom control in healed EO was not able to be made due to different definitions used in the RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted indirect comparisons based on currently available RCT data suggested significantly better treatment effect in symptom control of heartburn in patients with NERD for dexlansoprazole against esomeprazole. No statistically significant differences were found in other EO outcomes. However, these study findings need to be interpreted with caution due to small number of studies and other limitations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",23718547,

Studies often ignore chronicity by reporting short-duration outcomes and fail to account for medication tolerability. We assessed efficacy of oral medications on chronic peripheral neuropathic pain. METHODS: Relevant published, English-language, randomized controlled trials administering oral medications for peripheral neuropathic pain were identified through MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 1, 2012), EMBASE (1980 to December 2012), the Cochrane Library Databases (through December 2012), and the Oxford Pain Relief Database (through 2012). Included studies reported end point pain or pain reduction from baseline on an 11-point scale (0-10); had active treatment ≥ 12 weeks; reported an intention-to-treat analysis, and had 5-point quality score ≥ 3. Abstracted information included patient characteristics, neuropathic pain condition, drug and dosage arms, adverse events rates causing dropout, and secondary measures (50% pain improvement, global improvement, and sleep interference). Primary outcome meta-analysis, stratified by drug and dosage, was followed by an indirect treatment comparison adjusting for study dropouts due to adverse events. RESULTS: Seventeen studies comprised of 5,975 subjects, totaling 38 active trial arms evaluating 7 drugs, and 17 drug-dosing combinations met inclusion criteria. Mean pain reduction over placebo ranked highest for duloxetine 120 mg (1.17 95% CI 0.77, 1.58) and pregabalin 600 mg (1.11 95% CI 0.77, 1.45). The Indirect treatment comparison showed largest effect size for duloxetine at 120 and 60 mg followed by pregabalin 600 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Pregabalin and duloxetine had the largest beneficial effects for chronic peripheral neuropathic pain.

Subsequently, a number of nonrandomised studies have shown statins improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). Small randomised controlled trials (RCT) also show improved cardiac function, reduced inflammation and mortality with statins in HF. However, the findings of two large RCTs do not support the evidence provided by previous studies and suggest statins lack beneficial effects in HF. Two meta-analyses have shown statins do not improve survival, whereas two others showed improved cardiac function and reduced inflammation in HF. It appears lipophilic statins produce better survival and other outcome benefits compared to hydrophilic statins. But the two types have not been compared in direct comparison trials in HF. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of lipophilic and hydrophilic statin therapy in patients with HF. Our objectives are:1.

Naïve direct comparisons are in most instances inappropriate and should only be used for exploratory purposes and when no other options are possible. Adjusted indirect comparisons are currently the most commonly accepted method and use links through one or more common comparators. Mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) use Bayesian statistical models to incorporate all available data for a drug, even data that are not relevant to the comparator drug. MTCs reduce uncertainty but have not yet been widely accepted by researchers, nor drug regulatory and reimbursement authorities.

Anti-TNF drugs reduce the severity of the disease in the long term. This study compares the efficacy and safety of adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and golimumab in patients with psoriatic arthritis. METHODS: Direct comparison was based on a literature search of drug comparison studies, whereas indirect treatment comparison was based on phase III clinical trials with biological agents, involving similar populations and durations, and with the same outcome. ACR50 was taken as primary outcome for comparison, whereas ACR20 and ACR70 were used as secondary outcomes. Indirect comparisons were made using infliximab as the reference drug and the Bucher method. In calculating δ (the maximum acceptable difference as a clinical criterion of equivalence), use was made of half of the absolute risk reduction obtained in the meta-analysis of the clinical trials included in the indirect comparison (ARR 32%; δ: 16%). The four anti-TNF drugs were also compared in relation to the secondary outcomes and adverse effects. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Reported direct and indirect comparisons of the four drugs did not include golimumab, and did not yield conclusive results. Four clinical trials - one for each drug studied - were identified. The estimated differences for the primary outcome, ACR50, between infliximab and the other drugs were adalimumab (ARR 4%, 95% CI -9·5 to 17·5), etanercept (ARR 4%, 95% CI -10·5 to 18·5) and golimumab (ARR 9%, 95% CI -5·4 to 23·4). Likewise, there were no relevant differences between the drugs in relation to the secondary efficacy outcomes, except for etanercept, which was less effective in ACR70 response. For adverse reactions, there were also no significant differences except for injection site, reactions which were more frequent with etanercept, with a mean difference of 26% relative to infliximab. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found in ACR50 responses to the four drugs after 24 weeks. Injection-site reactions were more common with etanercept, but this was insufficient to invalidate the inference that clinically the four drugs can be regarded as clinically equivalent for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",23590560,

The assessment was based on patient-relevant outcomes. The company did not identify any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with direct comparisons of ingenol mebutate gel and diclofenac / hyaluronic acid gel. It therefore aimed at determining the added benefit on the basis of indirect comparisons. For both ingenol mebutate gel and diclofenac / hyaluronic acid gel, the company identified studies comparing the intervention therapy with a vehicle gel that did not contain ingenol mebutate gel or diclofenac. The company assumed that the hyaluronic acid gel itself, which served as vehicle in the diclofenac/hyaluronic acid studies, had an effect on actinic keratosis, whereas the drug-free vehicle gel in the ingenol mebutate studies did not. It therefore rejected an adjusted indirect comparison with vehicle gel as intermediate comparator. Instead, it chose a method called ""chaining of direct comparisons"" for the indirect comparison (comparison of ingenol mebutate gel versus vehicle gel, vehicle gel versus hyaluronic acid gel, and hyaluronic acid gel versus diclofenac / hyaluronic acid gel on the basis of the studies mentioned above). A comparison of ingenol mebutate vehicle and hyaluronic acid gel conducted in RCTs would have been necessary, however, to draw a valid conclusion on added benefit on the basis of the method chosen by the company. The company did not identify such studies. Groups with drug-free vehicle gel from different studies were compared in one step of the method. This was an unadjusted indirect comparison, which rendered randomization ineffective. Unadjusted indirect comparisons do not constitute a valid method of analysis, however. Moreover, the company included 2 non-randomized comparative studies on ingenol mebutate versus drug-free vehicle gel in the assessment of the outcome ""recurrence rate"". The company did not identify any studies with diclofenac/hyaluronic acid gel that recorded this outcome.

Both subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) have demonstrated effectiveness in this patient group; however, it remains uncertain which route of administration is more effective. OBJECTIVES: We sought to update existing systematic reviews on the clinical effectiveness of SCIT and SLIT versus placebo, to undertake a systematic review of head-to-head trials, and to compare the relative effectiveness of SCIT and SLIT in an adjusted indirect comparison. METHODS: Standard systematic review methods aimed at minimizing bias were used. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of SCIT or SLIT or trials of SCIT versus SLIT were included. Meta-analysis and indirect comparison meta-analysis with meta-regression were performed. RESULTS: Updated meta-analyses confirmed statistically significant benefits for SCIT and SLIT compared with placebo in adults and, to a lesser extent, in children. Only 1 head-to-head trial met the inclusion criteria; both this and the indirect comparisons did not provide conclusive results in favor of either SCIT or SLIT based on symptom-medication or quality-of-life scores. There was a trend toward favoring SCIT for symptom and medication scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is clear evidence of effectiveness of both SCIT and SLIT, superiority of one mode of administration over the other could not be consistently demonstrated through indirect comparison, and further research is needed to establish the comparative effectiveness of SCIT versus SLIT.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",23557834,

RESULTS: In our study, Bayesian and frequentist random effects models generally suggest the same drugs as most attractive, although neither suggests any significant differences between drugs.

The choice of enoxaparin comparator may influence the perceived relative efficacy and safety of the newer agents, and we aimed to identify any significant differences between the two enoxaparin regimens. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials that compared enoxaparin to oral anticoagulant (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban) thromboprophylaxis in elective total knee or hip arthroplasty. Total VTE and bleeding events were pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessed with the I2 statistic. We conducted adjusted indirect comparisons of bid vs once-daily enoxaparin regimes based on new oral anticoagulants as common comparators. RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled trials in hip and knee replacement surgery met the inclusion criteria. Adjusted indirect comparison showed that bid enoxaparin was significantly more effective in preventing VTE than enoxaparin once daily (relative risk [RR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-0.83; P &lt; .00001). For major and clinically relevant hemorrhage, adjusted indirect comparison showed that enoxaparin bid was nonsignificantly associated with increased risk of bleeding (RR 1.27; 95% CI, 0.97-1.65; P = .08) above that of enoxaparin once daily. Subgroup analysis limited to total knee arthroplasty trials showed similar results.

However, appropriate selection of prior distributions for unknown model parameters and checking of consistency assumptions required for feasible modeling remain particularly challenging. We compared Bayesian and traditional frequentist statistical methods for multiple treatment comparisons in the context of pharmacological treatments for female urinary incontinence (UI). DATA SOURCES: We searched major electronic bibliographic databases, U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviews, trial registries, and research grant databases up to November 2011 to find randomized studies published in English that examined drugs for urgency UI on continence, improvements in UI, and treatment discontinuation due to harms. REVIEW METHODS: We fitted fixed and random effects models in frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. In a hierarchical model of eight treatments, we separately analyzed one safety and two efficacy outcomes. We produced Bayesian and frequentist treatment ranks and odds ratios (and associated measures of uncertainty) across all bivariate treatment comparisons. We also calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve continence or avoid harms from pooled absolute risk differences. RESULTS: While frequentist and Bayesian analyses produced broadly comparable odds ratios of safety and efficacy, the Bayesian method's ability to deliver the probability that any treatment is best, or among the top two such treatments, offered a more meaningful clinical interpretation. In our study, two drugs emerged as attractive because while neither had any significant chance of being among the least safe drugs, both had greater than 50 percent chances of being among the top three drugs in terms of Best12 probability for one of the efficacy endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian methods are more flexible and their results more clinically interpretable but require more careful development and specialized software. KEY MESSAGES: Both Bayesian and frequentist hierarchical models can be effective in multiple treatment comparisons. Bayesian models sensibly shrink estimates towards each other, encouraging more borrowing of statistical strength from the entire collection of studies. Bayesian methods also lead to more clinically interpretable results (through their ability to assign probabilities to events), as well as more sensible rankings of the pharmacological treatments as compared to traditional NNT-based methods. Further development of hierarchical Bayesian multiple treatment comparison methods is warranted, especially for nonbinary data models, simultaneous decisionmaking across multiple endpoints, assessing consistency, and incorporating data sources of varying quality (e.g., clinical vs. observational data).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Comparison of frequentist and Bayesian approaches\n""]}",23638487,

Biological agents (ustekinumab, adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept) are indicated for moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis in adults who fail to respond to, have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including cyclosporine, methotrexate and PUVA Unfortunately, with new drugs, the pivotal trials leading to their licensing are often placebo-controlled trials rather than comparative trials vs. established therapies. Therefore, inference on comparative effectiveness of the newer agents must be derived indirectly, through estimation of effects of the new agents vs. a common comparator. The objective of this study is to compare the relative efficacy of the biological agents through a systematic review of the indirect clinical trial evidence. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for clinical trials of biological agents in psoriasis. Pivotal, randomized, double-blind, controlled (placebo) trials using intention-to-treat analysis were selected for detailed analysis. Trials must include PASI 75 as a primary end point. The indirect comparison was performed using the method of Bucher adjusted with the ITC calculator (Indirect Treatment Comparisons of the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health), etanercept being the reference drug. We defined delta value for therapeutic equivalence as a difference in the efficacy of 25% among the different treatment options. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fourteen studies (four for ustekinumab, three for adalimumab, three for infliximab and four for etanercept) were included. The indirect comparison results reveal that ustekinumab, adalimumab and infliximab were statistically superior to etanercept with an absolute risk difference for PASI 75 of 12% (95% CI = 5·9-18%), 11% (95% CI = 5·3-16·7%) and 24% (29·7-18·3%) respectively. However, in all situations, the 95% confidence interval does not achieve clinical relevance as no delta exceeds the previously set value (25%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Ustekinumab, adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept can be regarded as clinical equivalents for the treatment of psoriasis. Choice between these agents therefore depends on their relative safety profiles, individual contra-indications and cost effectiveness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",23442134,

This study implements a matching-adjusted indirect comparison technique to address that gap. METHODS: Patient-level data from a placebo-controlled trial of adalimumab (ADEPT) were re-weighted to match average baseline characteristics from pivotal published trials of etanercept and infliximab. ADEPT patients were re-weighted by odds of enrollment in comparator trials, estimated using logistic regression. Matched-on characteristics included PsA duration, age, gender, severity, active psoriasis, and concomitant treatment. After matching, placebo-adjusted treatment arms were compared at weeks 12 (or 14) and 24. Outcomes included ACR20/50/70, PsARC, HAQ, and modified TSS. PASI50/75/90 were compared for patients with active psoriasis. Cost per responder (CPR) was assessed in the US and Germany using matching-adjusted end-points and drug list prices. Statistical significance was assessed using weighted t-tests. RESULTS: After matching, adalimumab-treated patients had greater placebo-adjusted rates of ACR70 and PASI50/75/90 at week 24 compared with etanercept (all p < 0.05). Adalimumab patients had a higher placebo-adjusted rate of ACR70 than infliximab at week 14 (p = 0.034). Adalimumab treatment had lower CPR for ACR70 and PASI50/75/90 compared with etanercept at week 24, in both the US and Germany (all p < 0.02). Adalimumab had lower CPR than infliximab for all outcomes at week 24 (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Adalimumab is associated with higher ACR70 and PASI50/75/90 response rates than etanercept at week 24 and a higher ACR70 response rate than infliximab at week 14. Adalimumab has significant advantages over etanercept and infliximab in CPR across multiple end-points. KEY LIMITATIONS: The matching-adjusted indirect comparison method cannot account for unobserved differences in patient characteristics across trials, and only a head-to-head randomized clinical trial can fully avoid the limitations of indirect comparisons. CPR findings are limited to the US and German markets, and may not be generalizable to other markets with different relative pricing.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",23339434,

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for interventions which have been used for CIN. We included only the most recent meta-analysis of each intervention. We extracted data on the methodology, quality and results of each meta-analysis. We performed narrative synthesis and adjusted indirect comparison of interventions that were shown to be statistically significant compared with a placebo. RESULTS: We included 7 systematic reviews and meta-analyses involving 9 different interventions for CIN, with a total of 15 976 participants. A significantly decreased risk of CIN was reported in meta-analysis of the following interventions: N-acetylcysteine [odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.88, I(2)=64%], theophylline [relative risk (RR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.26-0.89, I(2)=44%], statins (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.77, I(2)=0%) and sodium bicarbonate (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.86, I(2)=49%). Furosemide was shown to increase the risk of CIN (RR 3.27, 95% CI 1.48-7.26, I(2)=0%). Other interventions such as renal replacement therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dopamine and fenoldapam failed to show any significant difference from the control group. CONCLUSION: Although there is some evidence to suggest that N-acetylcysteine, theophylline, sodium bicarbonate and statins may reduce incidence of CIN, limitations in the study quality and heterogeneity preclude any firm recommendations. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: N-acetylcysteine, theophylline, sodium bicarbonate and statins show some promise as potentially efficacious agents for preventing CIN, but more high-quality studies are needed before they can be recommended for use in routine practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",23239696,PMC3615404

This was based on demonstration of bioequivalence with the reference product (Prograf, Astellas Pharma), which makes these generic tacrolimus products prescribable, switchable and therapeutically equivalent to the reference product; yet, according to Spanish legislation, only prescribers can switch tacrolimus-containing products. METHODS: Data from independent bioequivalence studies that compare each generic product with the reference product were combined by adjusted indirect comparisons to investigate the relative bioavailability between generic drug products, since there is no direct bioequivalence study comparing generics to each other. RESULTS: Eight generic tacrolimus products in the form of capsules are presently authorized in Spain, but only five are marketed. These eight products represent only three different generic product developments. One product is authorized with four different names/companies, while another is authorized under three different names/companies. The adjusted indirect comparisons between generic products show bioequivalence within the conventional 80-125 % confidence interval acceptance criteria for area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax).

This study evaluated a Trial Similarity and Evidence Consistency Assessment (TSECA) framework for assessing key assumptions underlying the validity of indirect comparisons. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We applied the TSECA framework to 94 Cochrane Systematic Reviews that provided data to compare two interventions by both direct and indirect comparisons. Using the TSECA framework, two reviewers independently assessed and scored trial similarity and evidence consistency. A detailed case study provided further insight into the usefulness and limitations of the framework proposed. RESULTS: Trial similarity and evidence consistency scores obtained using the assessment framework were not associated with statistically significant inconsistency between direct and indirect estimates. The case study illustrated that the assessment framework could be used to identify potentially important differences in participants, interventions, and outcome measures between different sets of trials in the indirect comparison. CONCLUSION: Although the overall trial similarity and evidence consistency scores are unlikely to be sufficiently accurate for predicting inconsistency between direct and indirect estimates, the assessment framework proposed in this study can be a useful tool for identifying between-trial differences that may threaten the validity of indirect treatment comparisons.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,no_paitc,methodological",23186991,PMC3537077

We aimed to evaluate the impact of evergreening through the case study of the antidepressant citalopram and its chiral switch form escitalopram by evaluating treatment efficacy and acceptability for patients, as well as health insurance costs for society. METHODS: To assess efficacy and acceptability, we performed meta-analyses for efficacy and acceptability. We compared direct evidence (meta-analysis of results of head-to-head trials) and indirect evidence (adjusted indirect comparison of results of placebo-controlled trials). To assess health insurance costs, we analyzed individual reimbursement data from a representative sample of the French National Health Insurance Inter-regime Information System (SNIIR-AM) from 2003 to 2010, which allowed for projecting these results to the whole SNIIR-AM population (53 million people). RESULTS: In the meta-analysis of seven head-to-head trials (2,174 patients), efficacy was significantly better for escitalopram than citalopram (combined odds ratio (OR) 1.60 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.46)). However, for the adjusted indirect comparison of 10 citalopram and 12 escitalopram placebo-controlled trials, 2,984 and 3,777 patients respectively, efficacy was similar for the two drug forms (combined indirect OR 1.03 (0.82 to 1.30)). Because of the discrepancy, we could not combine direct and indirect data (test of inconsistency, P = 0.07). A similar discrepancy was found for treatment acceptability. The overall reimbursement cost burden for the citalopram, escitalopram and its generic forms was 120.6 million Euros in 2010, with 96.8 million Euros for escitalopram. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefit of escitalopram versus citalopram remains uncertain. In our case of evergreening, escitalopram represented a substantially high proportion of the overall reimbursement cost burden as compared with citalopram and the generic forms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Concept of evergreening interesting""]}",23167972,PMC3520785

Our aim was to review existing quantitative approaches for benefit-harm assessment and to develop an organizing framework that clarifies differences and aids selection of quantitative approaches for a particular benefit-harm assessment. METHODS: We performed a review of the literature to identify quantitative approaches for benefit-harm assessment. Our team, consisting of clinicians, epidemiologists, and statisticians, discussed the approaches and identified their key characteristics. We developed a framework that helps investigators select quantitative approaches for benefit-harm assessment that are appropriate for a particular decisionmaking context. RESULTS: Our framework for selecting quantitative approaches requires a concise definition of the treatment comparison and population of interest, identification of key benefit and harm outcomes, and determination of the need for a measure that puts all outcomes on a single scale (which we call a benefit and harm comparison metric). We identified 16 quantitative approaches for benefit-harm assessment. These approaches can be categorized into those that consider single or multiple key benefit and harm outcomes, and those that use a benefit-harm comparison metric or not. Most approaches use aggregate data and can be used in the context of single studies or systematic reviews. Although the majority of approaches provides a benefit and harm comparison metric, only four approaches provide measures of uncertainty around the benefit and harm comparison metric (such as a 95 percent confidence interval). None of the approaches considers the actual joint distribution of benefit and harm outcomes, but one approach considers competing risks when calculating profile-specific event rates. Nine approaches explicitly allow incorporating patient preferences. CONCLUSION: The choice of quantitative approaches depends on the specific question and goal of the benefit-harm assessment as well as on the nature and availability of data. In some situations, investigators may identify only one appropriate approach. In situations where the question and available data justify more than one approach, investigators may want to use multiple approaches and compare the consistency of results. When more evidence on relative advantages of approaches accumulates from such comparisons, it will be possible to make more specific recommendations on the choice of approaches.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",23163976,PMC3572426

An adjusted indirect comparison was performed to compare between novel oral anticoagulants. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to April 2012). Hand searching of relevant scientific works and contact with experts. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials of novel oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists for acute venous thromboembolism. Selected outcomes were recurrent events, major bleeding, and all cause mortality. RESULTS: Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, involving 16,701 patients evaluated for efficacy and 16,611 for safety. Data were stratified according to different novel oral anticoagulants. For recurrent acute venous thromboembolism, there were no significant differences in events rates between any of the anticoagulants and conventional treatment (rivaroxaban (four studies): relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.31; dabigatran (two studies): 1.09, 0.76 to 1.57; ximelagatran (two studies): 1.06, 0.62 to 1.80; and apixaban (one study): 0.98, 0.20 to 4.79). Rivaroxaban reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with conventional treatment (0.57, 0.39 to 0.84), whereas other novel oral anticoagulants did not (0.76 (0.49 to 1.18) for dabigatran; 0.54 (0.28 to 1.03) for ximelagatran; 2.95 (0.12 to 71.82) for apixaban). For all cause mortality there were no significant differences between the novel oral anticoagulants and conventional treatment (0.96 (0.72 to 1.27) for rivaroxaban; 1.00 (0.67 to 1.50) for dabigatran; 0.67 (0.42 to 1.08) for ximelagatran; 6.89 (0.36 to 132.06) for apixaban). The adjusted indirect comparison between rivaroxaban and dabigatran did not show superiority of either drug over the others for major bleeding (0.75, 0.41 to 1.34) or the other endpoints.

A secondary objective was to do the same analysis in the primary prevention cohort. DESIGN: Indirect treatment comparisons of phase III clinical trials of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, with a focus on the secondary prevention cohorts. A secondary analysis was done on the primary prevention cohort. DATA SOURCES: Medline and Central (up to June 2012), clinical trials registers, conference proceedings, and websites of regulatory agencies. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials of rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or apixaban compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: In the secondary prevention (previous stroke) subgroup, when apixaban was compared with dabigatran (110 mg and 150 mg twice daily) for efficacy and safety endpoints, the only significant difference seen was less myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.95) with apixaban compared with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. No significant differences were seen in efficacy and most safety endpoints between apixaban or dabigatran 150 mg twice daily versus rivaroxaban. Less haemorrhagic stroke (hazard ratio 0.15, 0.03 to 0.66), vascular death (0.64, 0.42 to 0.99), major bleeding (0.68, 0.47 to 0.99), and intracranial bleeding (0.27, 0.10 to 0.73) were seen with dabigatran 110 mg twice daily versus rivaroxaban. In the primary prevention (no previous stroke) subgroup, apixaban was superior to dabigatran 110 mg twice daily for disabling or fatal stroke (hazard ratio 0.59, 0.36 to 0.97). Compared with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, apixaban was associated with more stroke (hazard ratio 1.45, 1.01 to 2.08) and with less major bleeding (0.75, 0.60 to 0.94), gastrointestinal bleeding (0.61, 0.42 to 0.89), and other location bleeding (0.74, 0.58 to 0.94). Compared with rivaroxaban, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily was associated with more myocardial infarction events. No significant differences were seen for the main efficacy and safety endpoints between dabigatran 150 mg twice daily and rivaroxaban, or in efficacy endpoints between apixaban and rivaroxaban. Apixaban was associated with less major bleeding (hazard ratio 0.61, 0.48 to 0.78) than rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS: For secondary prevention, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran had broadly similar efficacy for the main endpoints, although the endpoints of haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death, major bleeding, and intracranial bleeding were less common with dabigatran 110 mg twice daily than with rivaroxaban. For primary prevention, the three drugs showed some differences in relation to efficacy and bleeding. These results are hypothesis generating and should be confirmed in a head to head randomised trial.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",23129490,PMC3489505

Patients with ADHD who are intolerant of or do not have an optimal response to stimulants often use non-stimulants as alternative therapies. Guanfacine extended-release (GXR) and atomoxetine (ATX) are the only non-stimulants approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for once-daily use in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD in the US. ATX has been on the market since 2002 while GXR was recently approved in 2009. To date, there is no comparative effectiveness or cost-effectiveness study comparing the two drugs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of GXR versus ATX for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents, using the comparative efficacy results from a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). METHODS: The MAIC method was used to compare the efficacy between GXR (target dose and lower doses) and ATX (target dose) in the absence of head-to-head clinical trials. Individual patients in the GXR trials were weighted such that the summary baseline characteristics and the efficacy of the placebo arm of the GXR trials matched exactly with those from published ATX trials. After weighting, the efficacy (i.e. change in the ADHD rating scale, fourth edition [ADHD-RS-IV] total score from baseline) was compared between each GXR dosing group and the ATX group. The results from the MAIC analyses were used to populate a 1-year Markov model that is used to compare the cost effectiveness of GXR versus ATX from a US third-party payer perspective. Effectiveness outcomes for each treatment group were estimated as the proportion of responders, defined as patients with ≥25% reduction in ADHD-RS-IV total score from baseline, and average quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Utilities associated with response/non-response and disutilities due to adverse events were applied in the model. Costs included drug and medical service costs and were inflated to 2011 US dollars ($US). Incremental cost/QALY and incremental cost/responder were estimated. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying all model parameters, including costs, utilities, and response rate. RESULTS: The target dose of GXR was 0.12 mg/kg/day. In match-adjusted populations with balanced baseline characteristics, patients receiving GXR at the dose of 0.09-0.12(p = 0.0016) [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] and 0.075-0.09 mg/kg/day (p = 0.0248) had better efficacy, while those receiving GXR at the dose of 0.046-0.075 mg/kg/day had comparable efficacy (p = 0.0699), compared with patients receiving ATX at the target dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day. In the base case of the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), GXR had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $US10 637/QALY and $US853/responder, compared with ATX (incremental costs: $US74; incremental effectiveness: 0.007 QALYs and 86 responders per 1000 patients treated). Results of all univariate sensitivity analyses showed that the model results were robust to changes in model inputs. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first application of the novel comparative efficacy method of MAIC to a CEA model.

Very little information is available on comparative discontinuation rates of the biologics. OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment discontinuations for 9 biologic DMARDs in adults with RA. METHODS: We searched electronic databases through May 2012 to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with RA that compared biologic DMARDs with placebo or another biologic DMARD. The primary outcome was treatment discontinuation during the blinded phase of the trials, measured as overall withdrawals, withdrawals resulting from lack of efficacy, and withdrawals resulting from adverse events. Random-effects meta-analysis estimated the effect size for individual agents, and adjusted indirect comparisons were made between biologics using mixed treatment comparisons (MTC) meta-analysis. RESULTS: Forty-four trials were included in the analysis. In comparison with placebo, biologics were less likely to be withdrawn because of lack of efficacy (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.27) and more likely to be withdrawn because of an adverse event (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.70). Based on the MTC, certolizumab had the most favorable overall withdrawal profile, followed by etanercept and rituximab. Certolizumab had lower relative withdrawal rates resulting from lack of efficacy than adalimumab, anakinra, and infliximab. Anakinra had higher relative withdrawal rates resulting from lack of efficacy than most other biologics. Certolizumab and infliximab had more, while etanercept had fewer, withdrawals because of adverse events than most other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on MTC using data from RCTs, differences in discontinuation rates were observed, generally favoring certolizumab, etanercept, and rituximab over other biologic DMARDs. These potential differences need to be further explored in head-to-head trials or well-conducted observational studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",23092868,

To achieve this goal, generic artemether/lumefantrine 20/120 mg tablets that have been prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO) were selected as model products for study. METHODS: Data from three bioequivalence studies conducted independently that compared three generics with the same reference product were used to indirectly determine the relative bioavailability between the generics themselves. RESULTS: The different methods of indirect comparison examined in this study provide consistent results. Methods based on the assumption of a large sample size give slightly narrower 90 % confidence intervals. Therefore, the use of methods based on the t test is recommended. Given the precision of the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) data, it is possible to conclude that the extent of exposure of artemether and lumefantrine is bioequivalent between the different generics studied. However, given the precision of the drug peak concentration (C(max)) data, it is not possible to demonstrate equivalence within the conventional acceptance range for all comparisons; it is possible to conclude bioequivalence within the widened acceptance range 75-133 %. CONCLUSIONS: From a clinical viewpoint, not only are these prequalified generics bioequivalent and interchangeable with the reference product (Coartem, Novartis), but also the existing indirect evidence makes it possible to conclude that these WHO prequalified products are bioequivalent between themselves with respect to the AUC. The lack of the necessary precision to demonstrate bioequivalence between generics with respect to the C(max) within the conventional acceptance range does not preclude considering them as interchangeable, if necessary, since C(max) is considered to be of less clinical relevance for the relevant therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",23011014,

However, these analyses may be biased by cross-trial differences in patient populations, sensitivity to modeling assumptions, and differences in the definitions of outcome measures. The objective of this study was to demonstrate how incorporating individual patient data (IPD) from trials of one treatment into indirect comparisons can address several limitations that arise in analyses based only on aggregate data. METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) use IPD from trials of one treatment to match baseline summary statistics reported from trials of another treatment. After matching, by using an approach similar to propensity score weighting, treatment outcomes are compared across balanced trial populations. This method is illustrated by reviewing published MAICs in different therapeutic areas. A novel analysis in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder further demonstrates the applicability of the method. The strengths and limitations of MAICs are discussed in comparison to those of indirect comparisons that use only published aggregate data. RESULTS: Example applications were selected to illustrate how indirect comparisons based only on aggregate data can be limited by cross-trial differences in patient populations, differences in the definitions of outcome measures, and sensitivity to modeling assumptions. The use of IPD and MAIC is shown to address these limitations in the selected examples by reducing or removing the observed cross-trial differences. An important assumption of MAIC, as in any comparison of nonrandomized treatment groups, is that there are no unobserved cross-trial differences that could confound the comparison of outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect treatment comparisons can be limited by cross-trial differences. By combining IPD with published aggregate data, MAIC can reduce observed cross-trial differences and provide decision makers with timely comparative evidence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",22999145,

Aggregate data (AD) and IPD can be combined using conventional pairwise meta-analysis when IPD cannot be obtained for all relevant studies. We extend the methodology to combine IPD and AD in a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis. METHODS: The proposed random-effects MTC models combine IPD and AD for a dichotomous outcome. We study the benefits of acquiring IPD for a subset of trials when assessing the underlying consistency assumption by including treatment-by-covariate interactions in the model. We describe three different model specifications that make increasingly stronger assumptions regarding the interactions. We illustrate the methodology through application to real data sets to compare drugs for treating malaria by using the outcome unadjusted treatment success at day 28. We compare results from AD alone, IPD alone and all data. RESULTS: When IPD contributed (i.e. either using IPD alone or combining IPD and AD), the chains converged, and we identified statistically significant regression coefficients for the interactions. Using IPD alone, we were able to compare only three of the six treatments of interest. When models were fitted to AD, the treatment effects and regression coefficients for the interactions were far more imprecise, and the chains did not converge. CONCLUSIONS: The models combining IPD and AD encapsulated all available evidence. When exploring interactions, it can be beneficial to obtain IPD for a subset of trials and to combine IPD with additional AD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",22987606,

This simulation study comprehensively investigated statistical properties and performances of commonly used ITC and MTC methods, including simple ITC (the Bucher method), frequentist and Bayesian MTC methods. METHODS: A simple network of three sets of two-arm trials with a closed loop was simulated. Different simulation scenarios were based on different number of trials, assumed treatment effects, extent of heterogeneity, bias and inconsistency. The performance of the ITC and MTC methods was measured by the type I error, statistical power, observed bias and mean squared error (MSE). RESULTS: When there are no biases in primary studies, all ITC and MTC methods investigated are on average unbiased. Depending on the extent and direction of biases in different sets of studies, ITC and MTC methods may be more or less biased than direct treatment comparisons (DTC). Of the methods investigated, the simple ITC method has the largest mean squared error (MSE). The DTC is superior to the ITC in terms of statistical power and MSE. Under the simulated circumstances in which there are no systematic biases and inconsistencies, the performances of MTC methods are generally better than the performance of the corresponding DTC methods. For inconsistency detection in network meta-analysis, the methods evaluated are on average unbiased. The statistical power of commonly used methods for detecting inconsistency is very low. CONCLUSIONS: The available methods for indirect and mixed treatment comparisons have different advantages and limitations, depending on whether data analysed satisfies underlying assumptions. To choose the most valid statistical methods for research synthesis, an appropriate assessment of primary studies included in evidence network is required.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Give overview of different meta analysis methods""]}",22970794,PMC3524036

BACKGROUND: The performance of zotarolimus-eluting stents versus other LES, and the possible improvements of R-ZES versus E-ZES still remain to be defined. METHODS: We undertook a meta-analysis of trials in which patients were randomly assigned to percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with R-ZES versus LES, or with E-ZES versus LES, as well as an indirect comparison of R-ZES versus E-ZES, with LES as common comparator. The primary efficacy endpoint was ischaemia-driven target vessel revascularisation (ID-TVR); the primary safety endpoints were myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death and cumulative definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST). RESULTS: Overall, 13'709 patients were assigned to PCI with R-ZES versus LES (n=7185) or with E-ZES versus LES (n=6524). The risk of ID-TVR (OR (95% CI)=1.06 (0.90 to 1.25), p=0.47), MI (1.00 (0.81 to 1.25), p=0.97), cardiac death (0.99 (0.69 to 1.42), p=0.96) and ST (1.18 (0.68 to 2.03), p=0.56) did not differ between R-ZES and LES. Patients receiving E-ZES were more likely to undergo ID-TVR as compared with those receiving LES (1.95 (1.40 to 2.73), p<0.0001). The risk of MI (0.91 (0.54 to 1.54), p=0.73), cardiac death (1.02 (0.54 to 1.91), p=0.96) and ST (1.10 (0.50 to 2.44), p=0.81) was similar between E-ZES and LES. At indirect comparison, PCI with R-ZES versus E-ZES reduced the risk of ID-TVR (0.54 (0.37 to 0.78), p=0.001), without increasing MI (1.09 (0.62 to 1.93), p=0.74), cardiac death (0.97 (0.46 to 2.00), p=0.93) and ST (1.07 (0.40 to 2.80), p=0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The antirestenotic efficacy of Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents is superior to Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stents and similar to other limus-eluting stents.

This paper reviews the published evidence regarding the cost effectiveness of second-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed, using the databases Academic Search Complete, Econlit, EMBASE and MEDLINE. Health economic evaluations of newer (second-generation) AEDs, published as full-length journal articles, were searched for. We focused on evaluations of newer AEDs as treatment for partial-onset seizures. 470 studies were initially identified and 19 were finally included. Information regarding (i) AEDs studied, (ii) cost effectiveness, and (iii) a variety of health economic modelling specifics was extracted from each study. Then, the included studies were summarized and a quality assessment was performed, according to the British Medical Journal's guidelines for economic studies. RESULTS: The results were as follows: (i) the cost per additional QALY for newer AEDs used as adjunctive treatment, compared with standard therapy, ranged between $US19 139 (levetiracetam) and $US57 210 (pregabalin) [year 2010 values]; no cost-effectiveness evidence was identified for felbamate, eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine or tiagabine; and (ii) all studies met at least 60% of the British Medical Journal's guidelines criteria, and seven studies were found to satisfy more than 80% of the criteria. Guidelines criteria not met involve inadequate reporting of input data and modelling details, including validation and availability of models used for cost-effectiveness calculations. CONCLUSIONS: Although failure to meet good practice guidelines influences the reliability of the presented evidence adversely, a sufficient number of the included studies were found to comply enough with the guidelines in order for the qualitative content of the cost-effectiveness results - that some of the newer AEDs are cost effective - to be reliable. In fact, this conclusion is likely to be relatively robust, since the effect of improved seizure control on labour market performance was not included in the base-case results in any of the included studies and improved seizure control need only to have a moderate effect on sickness absenteeism in order for the corresponding treatment to be cost effective even when willingness to pay for an additional QALY is low. However, the cost effectiveness of newer AEDs has only been studied for a small number of settings, and hence future studies incorporating additional settings are needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22924967,

Cardiovascular quality and outcomes,1941-7705 (Electronic),5,5,711-9,Baker WL and Phung OJ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22912382/,eng,,United States,"BACKGROUND: Oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban are alternatives to warfarin for preventing events in patients with atrial fibrillation. Direct comparative studies between agents are unavailable. Our objective was to conduct an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis between new oral agents in atrial fibrillation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central through February 2012 for randomized, controlled trials in patients with atrial fibrillation evaluating apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban versus warfarin. For dabigatran, only data from the Food and Drug Administration-approved dose were included. Outcomes included the composite of stroke or systemic embolism, any stroke, and major bleeding among, others. Outcomes were initially pooled using standard random-effects methods, producing risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Adjusted indirect comparisons using these pooled estimates were then performed. A total of 44 733 patients from 4 studies were analyzed. Most analyses yielded no differences between agents. Dabigatran lowered risk of composite outcome (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-1.00), ischemic stroke (0.67; 0.48-0.93), and hemorrhagic stroke (0.45; 0.45-0.99) versus rivaroxaban. No differences in all strokes or mortality were seen. Apixaban lowered the risk of major bleeding (0.74; 0.60-0.91) and gastrointestinal bleeding (0.58; 0.41-0.82) versus dabigatran and major bleeding versus rivaroxaban (0.68; 0.55-0.83), but increased systemic emboli versus rivaroxaban (3.86; 1.17-12.75). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in efficacy and safety parameters may exist between oral anticoagulant agents in patients with atrial fibrillation. Apixaban lowers the risk of major and gastrointestinal bleeding versus dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Dabigatran lowers the composite of stroke or systemic emboli, and ischemic stroke versus rivaroxaban.

A formal indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of dabigatran versus rivaroxaban was performed, using dabigatran clinical event rates from RE-LY for the safety-on-treatment population, adjusted to the ROCKET AF population. A previously described Markov model was modified to simulate anticoagulation treatment using ITC results as inputs. Model outputs included total costs, event rates, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The ITC found when compared to rivaroxaban, dabigatran had a lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) (relative risk [RR] = 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 - 0.67) and stroke (RR = 0.62; 95%CI 0.45-0.87). Over a lifetime horizon, the model found dabigatran-treated patients experienced fewer ICHs (0.33 dabigatran vs. 0.71 rivaroxaban) and ischaemic strokes (3.40 vs. 3.96) per 100 patient-years, and accrued more QALYs (6.17 vs. 6.01). Dabigatran-treated patients had lower acute care and long-term follow-up costs per patient ($52,314 vs. $53,638) which more than offset differences in drug costs ($7,299 vs. $6,128). In probabilistic analysis, dabigatran had high probability of being the most cost-effective therapy at common thresholds of willingness-to-pay (93% at a $20,000/QALY threshold).

(Afinitor is a registered trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA; Sutent is a registered trademark of Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA.) This analysis examined the projected cost-effectiveness of everolimus vs sunitinib in this setting from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A semi-Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of patients with advanced, progressive pNET and to estimate the cost per life-year gained (LYG) and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained when treating with everolimus vs sunitinib. Efficacy data were based on a weight-adjusted indirect comparison of the agents using phase 3 trial data. Model health states included: stable disease with no adverse events, stable disease with adverse events, disease progression, and death. Therapy costs were based on wholesale acquisition cost. Other costs such as physician visits, tests, hospitalizations, and adverse event costs were obtained from literature and/or primary research. Utility inputs were based on primary research. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the model's robustness. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, everolimus was associated with an incremental 0.448 LYG (0.304 QALYs) at an incremental cost of $12,673, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $28,281/LYG ($41,702/QALY gained). The ICER fell within the cost per QALY range for many widely used oncology drugs. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that, overall, there is a trend that everolimus is cost-effective compared to sunitinib in this setting. LIMITATIONS: Results of the indirect analysis were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Assumptions that treatment patterns are the same across therapies may not represent real-world practice. CONCLUSIONS: While the analysis is limited by its reliance on an indirect comparison of two phase 3 studies, everolimus is expected to be cost-effective relative to sunitinib in advanced, progressive pNET.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""likely not but to read just for the sake of it""]}",22881362,

If it is planned to view treatment comparisons in both a predefined subgroup and the full population as co-primary analyses, it is important that the statistical analysis controls the familywise type I error rate. Spiessens and Debois (Cont. Clin. Trials, 2010, 31, 647-656) recently proposed an approach specific for this setting, which incorporates an assumption about the correlation based on the known sizes of the different groups, and showed that this is more powerful than generic multiple comparisons procedures such as the Bonferroni correction. If recruitment is slow relative to the length of time taken to observe the outcome, it may be efficient to conduct an interim analysis. In this paper, we propose a new method for an adaptive clinical trial with co-primary analyses in a predefined subgroup and the full population based on the conditional error function principle. The methodology is generic in that we assume test statistics can be taken to be normally distributed rather than making any specific distributional assumptions about individual patient data. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the new method is more powerful than previously suggested analysis strategies. Furthermore, we show how the method can be extended to situations when the selection is not based on the final but on an early outcome. We use a case study in a targeted therapy in oncology to illustrate the use of the proposed methodology with non-normal outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",22865774,

INTRODUCTION: This study illustrates how network meta-analysis techniques (meta-analysis, adjusted indirect comparison, and MTC) can provide comparisons of the relative efficacy of postmenopausal osteoporosis therapies in the absence of comprehensive head-to-head trials. METHODS: Source articles were identified in MEDLINE; EMBASE; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via Wiley Interscience; and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) between April 28, 2009 and November 4, 2009. Two reviewers identified English-language articles reporting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with on-label dosing of marketed osteoporosis agents and fracture endpoints. Trial design, population characteristics, intervention and comparator, fracture outcomes, and adverse events were abstracted for analysis. Primary analyses included data from RCTs with fracture endpoints. Sensitivity analyses also included studies with fractures reported through adverse event reports. Meta-analysis compared fracture outcomes for pharmacological therapies vs. placebo (fixed and random effects models); adjusted indirect comparisons and MTC assessed fracture risk in postmenopausal women treated with denosumab vs. other agents. RESULTS: Using data from 34 studies, random effects meta-analysis showed that all agents except etidronate significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo; denosumab, risedronate, and zoledronic acid significantly reduced the risk for nonvertebral and hip fracture, while alendronate, strontium ranelate, and teriparatide significantly reduced the risk for nonvertebral fractures. MTC showed denosumab to be more effective than strontium ranelate, raloxifene, alendronate, and risedronate in preventing new vertebral fractures. CONCLUSIONS: The conditional estimates of relative treatment efficacy indicate that there are important differences in fracture risk reduction profiles for marketed pharmacological therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22832638,PMC3662000

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of the 3 new agents based on data from their published warfarin-controlled randomized trials, using the method of adjusted indirect comparisons. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included findings from 44 535 patients enrolled in 3 trials of the efficacy of dabigatran (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy [RELY]), apixaban (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE]), and rivaroxaban (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation [ROCKET-AF]), each compared with warfarin. The primary efficacy end point was stroke or systemic embolism; the safety end point we studied was major hemorrhage. To address a lack of comparability between trial populations caused by the restriction of ROCKET-AF to high-risk patients, we conducted a subgroup analysis in patients with a CHADS(2) score ≥3. We found no statistically significant efficacy differences among the 3 drugs, although apixaban and dabigatran were numerically superior to rivaroxaban. Apixaban produced significantly fewer major hemorrhages than dabigatran and rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS: An indirect comparison of new anticoagulants based on existing trial data indicates that in patients with a CHADS(2) score ≥3 dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban 5 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 mg resulted in statistically similar rates of stroke and systemic embolism, but apixaban had a lower risk of major hemorrhage compared with dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Until head-to-head trials or large-scale observational studies that reflect routine use of these agents are available, such adjusted indirect comparisons based on trial data are one tool to guide initial therapeutic choices.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22787066,PMC3471365

Treatment by covariate interactions can be included in MTC models to explore how the covariate modifies the treatment effects. If interactions exist, the assumptions underlying MTCs may be invalidated. For conventional pair-wise meta-analysis, important benefits regarding the investigation of such interactions, gained from using individual patient data (IPD) rather than aggregate data (AD), have been described. We aim to compare IPD MTC models including patient-level covariates with AD MTC models including study-level covariates. IPD and AD random-effects MTC models for dichotomous outcomes are specified. Three assumptions are made regarding the interactions (i.e. independent, exchangeable and common interactions). The models are applied to a dataset to compare four drugs for treating malaria (i.e. amodiaquine-artesunate, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ), artemether-lumefantrine and chlorproguanil-dapsone plus artesunate) using the outcome unadjusted treatment success at day 28. The treatment effects and regression coefficients for interactions from the IPD models were more precise than those from AD models. Using IPD, assuming independent or exchangeable interactions, the regression coefficient for chlorproguanil-dapsone plus artesunate versus DHAPQ was statistically significant and assuming common interactions, the common coefficient was significant; whereas using AD, no coefficients were significant. Using IPD, DHAPQ was the best drug; whereas using AD, the best drug varied. Using AD models, there was no evidence that the consistency assumption was invalid; whereas, the assumption was questionable based on the IPD models. The AD analyses were misleading.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",22786621,

New oral anticoagulants (NOA) showed encouraging results vs. warfarin but there are no data directly comparing different NOA. We performed an adjusted indirect meta-analysis. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched. Efficacy end points were the cumulative rate of thomboembolic stroke (TES) and systemic embolism (SE). Main safety end point was the rate of hemorrhagic stroke (HS). RESULTS: Three RCTs (50578 patients) were included. Overall, NOA were comparable to warfarin according to the cumulative risk of TES and SE, as well as for TES alone. NOA were associated with a reduced rate of SE [OR 0.64 (0.44, 0.94], P=0.02]. Compared to warfarin, NOA were associated with a significantly reduced risk of HS [OR 0.43 (0.34, 0.55), P<0.001, NNT to avoid a HS 153] and all cause death [OR 0.90 [0.84, 0.96], P=0.03, NNT to save one fatality 43]. Head to head comparison showed that in terms of cumulative rate of TES/SE, as well as of TES, none of the NOA was significantly superior to the others (all Ps>0.05). Rivaroxaban showed superiority in the prevention of SE. Dabigatran 150 mg/twice daily was associated with the largest reduction in the risk of HS vs. warfarin and vs. other NOA. Overall mortality was quite comparable across NOA. CONCLUSION: Overall superiority of NOA over warfarin is largely influenced by the reduction of HS. Dabigatran 150 mg/twice daily seems to have the best risk/benefit profile.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22771555,

Although most MTCs use aggregate data (AD), a proportion of the evidence base might be available at the individual level (IPD). We develop a series of novel Bayesian statistical MTC models to allow for the simultaneous synthesis of IPD and AD, potentially incorporating study and individual level covariates. The effectiveness of different interventions to increase the provision of functioning smoke alarms in households with children was used as a motivating dataset. This included 20 studies (11 AD and 9 IPD), including 11 500 participants. Incorporating the IPD into the network allowed the inclusion of information on subject level covariates, which produced markedly more accurate treatment-covariate interaction estimates than an analysis solely on the AD from all studies. Including evidence at the IPD level in the MTC is desirable when exploring participant level covariates; even when IPD is available only for a fraction of the studies. Such modelling may not only reduce inconsistencies within networks of trials but also assist the estimation of intervention subgroup effects to guide more individualised treatment decisions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""To read +++: Clearly describes another paitc method""]}",22764016,

Competition between males or females for mating opportunities and/or local resources predicts a female bias in taxa with monogamous mating systems and a male-biased dispersal in polygynous species. In birds and mammals, the patterns of dispersal between sexes are well explored, while dispersal patterns in protandrous hermaphroditic fish species have not been studied. We collected 549 adult individuals of Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) from four locations in the South China Sea. To assess the difference in patterns of dispersal between sexes, we genotyped all individuals with 18 microsatellites. Significant genetic differentiation was detected among and within sampling locations. The parameters of population structure (F(ST)), relatedness (r) and the mean assignment index (mAIC), in combination with data on tagging-recapture, supplied strong evidences for female-biased dispersal in the Asian seabass. This result contradicts our initial hypothesis of no sex difference in dispersal. We suggest that inbreeding avoidance of females, female mate choice under the condition of low mate competition among males, and male resource competition create a female-biased dispersal. The bigger body size of females may be a cause of the female-biased movement. Studies of dispersal using data from DNA markers and tagging-recapture in hermaphroditic fish species could enhance our understanding of patterns of dispersal in fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_human,wrong_topic",22701591,PMC3373547

DESIGN: Systematic review, meta-analysis, and indirect treatment comparisons. DATA SOURCES: Medline and CENTRAL (up to April 2011), clinical trials registers, conference proceedings, and websites of regulatory agencies. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials of rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or apixaban compared with enoxaparin for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement. Two investigators independently extracted data. Relative risks of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, clinically relevant bleeding, deaths, and a net clinical endpoint (composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and death) were estimated using a random effect meta-analysis. RevMan and ITC software were used for direct and indirect comparisons, respectively. RESULTS: 16 trials in 38,747 patients were included. Compared with enoxaparin, the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism was lower with rivaroxaban (relative risk 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.75) and similar with dabigatran (0.71, 0.23 to 2.12) and apixaban (0.82, 0.41 to 1.64). Compared with enoxaparin, the relative risk of clinically relevant bleeding was higher with rivaroxaban (1.25, 1.05 to 1.49), similar with dabigatran (1.12, 0.94 to 1.35), and lower with apixaban (0.82, 0.69 to 0.98). The treatments did not differ on the net clinical endpoint in direct or indirect comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: A higher efficacy of new anticoagulants was generally associated with a higher bleeding tendency.

However, a comparison to irinotecan + infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FOLFIRI) is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To explore clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding bevacizumab to a regimen of FOLFIRI for the first-line treatment of mCRC in the Republic of Korea by conducting an indirect treatment comparison. METHODS: A health-economic model was developed to investigate the possible health outcomes (life-years gained [LYG]), direct costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding bevacizumab to a FOLFIRI regimen. Data on progression-free and overall survival were derived from randomized clinical trials and were used in the indirect treatment comparison. The annual discount rate for costs and outcomes was 5%. A lifetime horizon of 8 years was used. Sensitivity analyses were carried out on all pivotal model assumptions. RESULTS: Incremental mean overall survival among patients treated with bevacizumab + FOLFIRI varied between 8.6 and 15.7 months compared with patients treated with FOLFIRI alone. The deterministic base-case result was 1.177 LYG. The discounted ICERs ranged from μ31.8 to μ39.5 million/LYG, with the base-case result being μ34.5 million/LYG. Treatment effect had the most impact on the outcomes in this model. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is no formal threshold for ICER per LYG in Korea, funding may be considered for bevacizumab + FOLFIRI, particularly if the severity and end-of-life nature of mCRC is taken into account.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22657254,

OBJECTIVES: Review the use of generic preference-based measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) within the context of spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify SCI-related publications that contained any of the following preference-based HRQoL instruments: 15D, Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-4D, AQoL-6D, EQ-5D, EQ-5D-5L, Health Utilities Index (HUI)-2, HUI-3, Quality of Well-Being Scale Self-Administered (QWB-SA), SF-6D(SF-36) or SF-6D(SF-12). In addition to providing an overview of how different preference-based measures have been adopted in SCI research to-date, a focus of evaluation was to collate and appraise evidence for measurement properties and identify knowledge gaps. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were identified. No studies have used preference-based measures in their conventional form, that is, to calculate quality-adjusted life years using patient-level data. Eleven papers reported mean utility scores (across six different instruments). Directly comparable data exists for only one SCI-specific sample, which showed variation across EQ-5D (0.63), HUI-2 (0.81) and HUI-3 (0.68) index scores. Indirect comparisons suggested differences between QWB-SA and SF-6D index scores within tetraplegic and paraplegic patient groups. Only the QWB-SA and SF-6D have undergone (partial) psychometric evaluation, with the respective authors concluding that the measures have potential for SCI research. CONCLUSIONS: Despite 'cost-effectiveness' being an increasingly important consideration for decision makers in all areas of health care, there is a distinct lack of conceptual or empirical research regarding the appropriateness of alternative preference-based HRQoL measures for SCI populations. Given the support for economic evaluation within a cost-utility framework and the paucity of psychometric evidence regarding current instruments, further research is needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_itc",22641255,

No direct comparisons, however, are available for indacaterol 150 μg with formoterol or indacaterol 300 μg with salmeterol. Indacaterol trial evidence was synthesized to provide coherent estimates of indacaterol 150 μg and indacaterol 300 μg relative to formoterol, salmeterol, and tiotropium. METHODS: Four randomized controlled trials were combined with Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons by using individual patient-level data. End points of interest were trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and response (≥ 4 points), and Transition Dyspnea Index total score and response (≥ 1 point). RESULTS: Indacaterol 150 μg demonstrated a higher FEV(1) than did formoterol at 12 weeks and 6 months (0.10 L difference; 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.06-0.14), as did indacaterol 300 μg versus salmeterol (0.06 L difference at 12 weeks; CrI = 0.02-0.10; 0.06 L at 6 months; CrI = 0.02-0.11). Regarding SGRQ, indacaterol 150 μg demonstrated a comparable proportion of responders versus formoterol, as did indacaterol 300 μg versus salmeterol. In comparison to tiotropium, indacaterol 150 μg demonstrated a greater proportion of responders (odds ratio = 1.52 at 12 weeks; CrI 1.15-2.00). For Transition Dyspnea Index, indacaterol 150 μg and formoterol showed a similar response. Indacaterol 300 μg was more efficacious than salmeterol (odds ratio = 1.65 at 12 weeks; CrI 1.16-2.34). Overall, indacaterol 150 μg showed the greatest efficacy for SGRQ and indacaterol 300 μg for FEV(1) and Transition Dyspnea Index. CONCLUSION: Indacaterol is expected to be comparable to formoterol, salmeterol, and tiotropium, providing higher FEV(1) than formoterol and salmeterol and greater improvement in the SGRQ total score than tiotropium.

Between 2005 and 2007, five randomized studies comparing different treatment arms among artesunate-amodiaquine and other ACT were conducted in Cameroonian children aged two to 60 months who had uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In these studies, the categorical criterion proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess the relative effectiveness of anti-malarial drugs was repeatedly evaluated on Days 14, 21 and 28 after treatment initiation. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of different treatments on this repeated ordinal outcome, hence using the fully available information. METHODS: The quantitative synthesis was based on individual patient data. Due to the incomplete block design concerning treatment arms between different trials, a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis approach was adopted. The repeated ordinal outcome was modelled through a latent variable, as a proportional odds mixed model with trial, period and treatment arms as covariates. The model was further complexified to account for the variance heterogeneity, and the individual log-residual variance was modelled as a linear mixed model, as well. The effects of individual covariates at inclusion, such as parasitaemia, fever, gender and weight, were also tested. Model parameters were estimated using a Bayesian approach via the WinBUGS software. After selecting the best model using Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), mixed treatment comparisons were based on the estimated treatment effects. RESULTS: Modeling the residual variance improved the model ability to adjust the data. The results showed that, compared to artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHPP) was significantly more efficacious. Artesunate-chlorproguanil-dapsone (ASCD) was less efficacious than artesunate-sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (ASSP), artemether-lumefantrine (AMLM) and DHPP, the difference with the latter being significant. No difference in efficacy was found between ASAQ and AMLM. CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons of a network of connected randomized trials with repeated measurements of the primary categorical outcome allowed to take into account both the individual- and between- studies sources of heterogeneity. The results of the present study complete the previous quantitative review based on a binary outcome at a fixed time point, suggesting that DHPP represents an alternative for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Cameroonian children.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22554024,PMC3496581

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved ADA as a medication for use in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This year marks 10 years of clinical experience with ADA. Long-term extension studies of some of the initial clinical trials, as well as data from large patient registries, are demonstrating ongoing benefit for responders. Potential side effects such as increased risk of infection, lymphoma, congestive heart failure, and demyelination continue to be examined, as the available data are not unanimous in showing an increase in incidence. In balancing both the advantages and the disadvantages of using ADA, the drug's overall effectiveness and its availability for use in patients with hepatic or renal comorbidities are weighed against the high cost. ADA is expected to have a leading role in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions for years to come. Future studies will need to address the optimal sequence of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics to use, combinations of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, and head-to-head comparisons of biologics in clinical trials. For those who go into clinical remission on an anti-tumor necrosis factor medication, unanswered questions remain about identifying the patients who can maintain the remission off all drugs, or at least off injected medication.

We aimed to perform a systematic review of incident and recurrent CDI in PPI users, and to evaluate the relative impact of concurrent antibiotic use, or switching acid suppression to histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to December 2011 for controlled observational studies that reported on the risk of CDI with and without PPI use. We performed random effects meta-analysis and assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: We included 42 observational studies (30 case-control, 12 cohort) totalling 313,000 participants overall.

Subgroup analysis failed to fully clarify the source of the substantial statistical heterogeneity.

Conversely, concomitant use of PPI and antibiotics conferred a greater-risk OR 1.96 (95% CI 1.03-3.70) above that of PPIs alone. For PPI and antibiotics, the Rothman's synergy index was 1.36 and attributable proportion of risk from interaction 0.19, indicating an increased risk from interaction beyond the effects of each drug alone. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the substantial statistical and clinical heterogeneity, our findings indicate a probable association between PPI use and incident and recurrent CDI. This risk is further increased by concomitant use of antibiotics and PPI, whereas H2RAs may be less harmful.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22525304,

However, for clinical decisions, we need to know the effectiveness of each possible treatment in comparison with all relevant alternatives, not with just one. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacies and adverse effects of all relevant antibiotics for UTI treatment simultaneously by performing a network meta-analysis using direct and indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: Using logistic regression analysis, we performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published after 1999 that compared different oral antibiotic or placebo regimens for UTI treatment in general practice or outpatient settings. We looked at five binary outcomes: early clinical, early bacteriological, late clinical and late bacteriological outcomes, as well as adverse effects. Consequently, a ranking of the antibiotic regimens could be composed. RESULTS: Using a network structure, we could compare and rank nine treatments from 10 studies. Overall, ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin appeared the most effective treatments, and amoxicillin-clavulanate appeared the least effective treatment. In terms of adverse effects, there were no significant differences. DISCUSSION: Network meta-analysis shows some clear efficacy differences between different antibiotic treatments for UTI in women. It provides a useful tool for clinical decision making in everyday practice. Moreover, the method can be used for meta-analyses of RCTs across primary care and beyond.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22516128,

METHODS: A systematic literature search identified 11 individual studies investigating the efficacy of abatacept, infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab in adult patients with RA that did not respond to MTX. The clinical trials included in this analysis were similar in trial design, baseline patient characteristics, and background therapy (i.e., MTX). The key clinical endpoints of interest were the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) change from baseline (CFB) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses at 6 months (24-28 weeks). Results were analyzed using Bayesian network metaanalysis methods, and were expressed as differences in HAQ CFB and ACR20/50/70 relative risks, with 95% credible limits (CrL). RESULTS: Analysis of HAQ CFB at 6 months showed that abatacept is more efficacious than placebo [mean difference in HAQ CFB: -0.30 (95% CrL -0.42; -0.16)] and comparable to all other biologic agents, in patients receiving MTX as background treatment. Abatacept is also expected to result in a higher proportion of ACR responders compared to placebo, with relative risks ranging from 1.90 (95% CrL 1.24; 2.57) for ACR20 to 3.72 (95% CrL 1.50; 10.52) for ACR70, and to result in comparable proportions of ACR responders as other biologic agents, at 6 months. CONCLUSION: Abatacept is expected to result in improvement in functional status comparable to other recommended biologic agents in patients with RA who are unresponsive to MTX in the UK.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22505698,

The submission addressed only part of the decision problem and did not provide evidence to compare trabectedin (Yondelis®, PharmaMar) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLDH) (Caelyx®, Schering-Plough) with key comparators. The submission's direct comparison evidence came from one reasonable-quality randomised controlled trial (RCT) of trabectedin and PLDH versus PLDH alone (ET743-OVA-301). The results of the RCT were subdivided into the entire platinum-sensitive population (> 6-month relapse after initial platinum-based chemotherapy) and partially platinum-sensitive (≥ 6- to 12-month relapse) and fully platinum-sensitive (> 12-month relapse) populations. The outcomes included were overall survival, progression-free survival measured by three types of assessor, response rates, adverse effects of treatment, health-related quality of life and cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained. A mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis comparing trabectedin and PLDH with single-agent PLDH within the entire platinum-sensitive population, with paclitaxel or with topotecan also formed part of the submission. The RCT data showed that trabectedin plus PLDH compared with PLDH monotherapy had a significant effect on overall survival only within the partially platinum-sensitive subgroup. PFS results reported by the independent radiologists showed significant effects in favour of the trabectedin and PLDH arm for the entire and partially platinum-sensitive populations only. Rates of grade 3 and 4 adverse events were mostly higher in the trabectedin and PLDH arm than in the PLDH alone arm. There were several issues regarding the undertaking of the MTC, and thus the data were not considered robust. Furthermore, the ERG did not believe the MTC to be necessary to answer the decision problem. The manufacturer submitted a de novo cost-effectiveness model. The main analysis compared trabectedin in combination with PLDH versus paclitaxel, topotecan and PLDH (each as monotherapy) in the entire platinum-sensitive population, using results estimated from the MTC. Additional analyses were presented comparing trabectedin in combination with PLDH versus PLDH monotherapy using direct evidence from the OVA-301 trial for the fully, partially and entire platinum-sensitive populations. The cost per QALY gained for trabectedin in combination with PLDH versus PLDH monotherapy was estimated to be £ 70,076 in the main analysis. In the additional analyses, the cost per QALY gained for trabectedin in combination with PLDH versus PLDH monotherapy was £ 94,832, £ 43,996 and £ 31,092 for the entire, partially and fully platinum-sensitive populations, respectively. Additional work was undertaken by the ERG using patient-level data and amending some assumptions to provide a better statistical fit to the Kaplan-Meier data than the exponential distribution assumed by the manufacturer. The ERG base-case estimate of the cost per QALY of trabectedin in combination with PLDH ranged from £46,503 to £54,607 in the partially platinum-sensitive population. At the time of writing, trabectedin in combination with PLDH for the treatment of women with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer is not recommended by NICE in the final appraisal determination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21609655,

The purpose of this study is to compare annualized relapse rates (ARR) of fingolimod versus all of the commonly used first-line treatments in RRMS using evidence from both placebo-controlled and head-to-head studies. In absence of the head-to-head data between fingolimod and the other treatments, these comparisons were formed using meta-analysis techniques for indirect treatment comparisons. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library with no limitations applied on publication language or dates. Included studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating one or more of fingolimod, interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, or glatiramer acetate in RRMS populations. Primary outcome was ARR. Data extraction included author, year, treatment, dosage, mean age, percentage females, duration of disease, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at baseline, relapses in 2 years prior to baseline, trial duration, relapse-related outcome, and definition of relapse. The indirect treatment comparisons were performed using a mixed-treatment comparison framework. ARR was analyzed as a Poisson outcome. RESULTS: The relative ARRs, for each treatment versus fingolimod, estimated from our meta-analyses were 1.43 (glatiramer acetate 20 mg), 1.51 (interferon beta-1b 250 mcg), 1.55 (interferon beta-1a 44 mcg), 1.67 (interferon beta-1a 22 mcg), 1.93 (interferon beta-1a 30 mcg), and 2.32 (placebo). None of the 95% confidence intervals for these estimates overlapped unity, implying statistical significance of these findings. LIMITATIONS: The key limitations of this study are the persisting heterogeneity even after adjusting for covariates and the variability in outcome definition across the included trials. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that fingolimod significantly reduces relapse frequency in patients with RRMS compared with current first-line disease-modifying therapies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22462530,

Heterogeneity indicates the presence of effect-modifiers. A distinction is usually made between true variability in treatment effects due to variation between patient populations or settings, and biases related to the way in which trials were conducted. Variability in relative treatment effects threatens the external validity of trial evidence, and limits the ability to generalise from the results, imperfections in trial conduct represent threats to internal validity. In either case it is emphasised that, although we continue to focus attention on evidence from trials, the study of effect-modifying covariates is in every way a form of observational study, because patients cannot be randomised to covariate values. This document provides guidance on methods for outlier detection, meta-regression and bias adjustment, in pair-wise meta-analysis, indirect comparisons and network meta-analysis, using illustrative examples. Guidance is given on the implications of heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness analysis. We argue that the predictive distribution of a treatment effect in a “new” trial may, in many cases, be more relevant to decision making than the distribution of the mean effect. Investigators should consider the relative contribution of true variability and random variation due to biases, when considering their response to heterogeneity. Where subgroup effects are suspected, it is suggested that a single analysis including an interaction term is superior to running separate analyses for each subgroup. Three types of meta-regression models are discussed for use in network meta-analysis where trial-level effect-modifying covariates are present or suspected: (1) Separate unrelated interaction terms for each treatment; (2) Exchangeable and related interaction terms; (3) A single common interaction term. We argue that the single interaction term is the one most likely to be useful in a decision making context. Illustrative examples of Bayesian metaregression against a continuous covariate and meta-regression against “baseline” risk are provided and the results are interpreted. Annotated WinBUGS code is set out in an Appendix. Meta-regression with individual patient data is capable of estimating effect modifiers with far greater precision, because of the much greater spread of covariate values. Methods for combining IPD in some trials with aggregate data from other trials are explained. Finally, four methods for bias adjustment are discussed: meta-regression; use of external priors to adjust for bias associated with markers of lower study quality; use of network synthesis to estimate and adjust for quality-related bias internally; and use of expert elicitation of priors for bias.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Also a methodological article that seem to explain how to combine IPD and aggregated data from different sources, at the same time of the inception of MAIC and STC""]}",27905717,

DATA SOURCES: English-language articles from 1980 to February 2011 identified through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts; unpublished literature including dossiers from pharmaceutical companies. METHODS: Two people independently selected relevant head-to-head trials of any sample size, prospective cohort studies with at least 100 participants, and relevant good- or fair-quality meta-analyses that compared benefits or harms of 14 drug therapies. Retrospective cohort studies were also included for harms. For biologic DMARDs, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCTs were also included. We required trials and cohort studies to have a study duration of at least 12 weeks. Literature was synthesized qualitatively within and between the two main drug classes (oral and biologic DMARDs). Network meta-analysis also was performed to examine the relative efficacy of biologic DMARDs and comparing withdrawal rates from placebo controlled trials. RESULTS: Head-to-head trials showed no clinically important differences in efficacy among oral DMARD comparisons (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide). The only head-to-head trial comparing biologic DMARDs (abatacept vs. infliximab) found no clinically important differences. Combination therapy of biologic DMARDs plus methotrexate improved clinical response rates and functional capacity more than monotherapy with methotrexate. Network meta-analyses found higher odds of reaching ACR 50 response for etanercept compared with most other biologic DMARDs (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab) for methotrexate-resistant patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Similar overall tolerability profiles were found among oral and biologic DMARDs, but short-term adverse events were more common with biologic DMARDs. Adjusted indirect comparisons of biologic DMARDs found that certolizumab had the most favorable overall withdrawal profile, followed by etanercept and rituximab. Certolizumab had lower relative withdrawal rates due to lack of efficacy than adalimumab, anakinra, and infliximab. Certolizumab and infliximab had more, while etanercept had fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than most other drugs. Evidence was insufficient to assess comparative risk of serious adverse events among biologic DMARDs. Combinations of biologic DMARDs have higher rates of serious adverse events than biologic DMARD monotherapy. Limited data existed for subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Limited head-to-head comparative evidence does not support one therapy over another for adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Network meta-analyses from placebo-controlled trials of biologics suggest some differences, including higher odds of reaching ACR 50 response, but strength of evidence was low.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",22696776,

METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed in PUBMED, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. Abstracts presented at two conferences were also researched. The effects of erlotinib and pemetrexed on overall survival and progression-free survival were compared using an indirect treatment comparison method with placebo or observation as a common comparator. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled studies were included. Both interventions offered significant advantages for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo or observation. Using indirect comparison meta-analysis, the relative hazards ratio of pemetrexed compared with erlotinib for PFS was 0.71 (95% CI 0.60-0.85; p = 0.0001), suggested that pemetrexed was superior to erlotinib in terms of progression-free survival.

As long as a meta-analysis is not limited by poor quality of included trials, unexplainable heterogeneity and/or reporting bias of individual trials, meta-analyses can be instrumental in reliably demonstrating benefit or harm of an intervention when results of individual randomised controlled trials are conflicting or inconclusive. Therefore meta-analyses should be conducted as part of a systematic review, i.e., a systematic approach to answer a focused clinical question. Important features of a systematic review are a comprehensive, reproducible search for primary studies, selection of studies using clear and transparent eligibility criteria, standardised critical appraisal of studies for quality, and investigation of heterogeneity among included studies. Cumulative meta-analysis may prevent delays in the introduction of effective treatments and may allow for early detection of harmful effects of interventions. As opposed to meta-analysis based on aggregate study data, individual patient data meta-analyses offer the advantage to use standardised criteria across trials and reliably investigate subgroup effects of interventions. Network meta-analysis allows the integration of data from direct and indirect comparisons in order to compare multiple treatments in a comprehensive analysis and determine the best treatment among several options. We conclude that meta-analysis has become a popular, versatile, and powerful tool. If rigorously conducted as part of a systematic review, it is essential for evidence-based decision making in clinical practice as well as on the health policy level.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Compare AD and IPD NMA""]}",22407741,

METHODS: An economic model was developed to compare costs and clinical outcomes over a 5-year time horizon. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at a 5% rate, in accordance with Brazilian pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Clinical inputs were determined using indirect treatment comparisons. Costs were derived from public reimbursement databases and reported in 2010 Brazilian real (R$1 = USD$0.52). Clinical outcomes included progression-free survival years (PFYs), life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The economic outcome was the incremental cost per LY, PFY, or QALY gained. The impact of variations in individual inputs (eg, drug cost, drug effectiveness) was examined using one-way sensitivity analyses. Overall model robustness was tested using probabilistic sensitivity analyses, varying the ranges of all input parameters within their standard distributions. RESULTS: Expected cost per patient was R$41,195 for CAP, R$95,256 for LAP/CAP, and R$113,686 for TRAST/CAP. Respective LYs were 1.406, 1.695, and 1.465; PFYs were 0.473, 0.711, and 0.612; and QALYS were 0.769, 0.958, and 0.827. LAP/CAP dominated TRAST/CAP for all outcomes. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of LAP/CAP over CAP were R$186,563 for LYs, R$226,403 for PFYs, and R$284,864 for QALYs. Results remained unchanged in one-way sensitivity analyses. In probabilistic analyses, LAP/CAP was dominant over TRAST/CAP in 93.5% of simulations. CONCLUSION: LAP/CAP increases survival for women with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive metastatic breast cancer. LAP/CAP is cost-effective against TRAST/CAP (ie, produces more benefits at a lower cost) and can be considered cost-effective over CAP at a willingness-to-pay of about R$290,000 (US$151,000) per QALY gained.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",24367204,PMC3846651

A limited design of experiment was conducted to establish a standardized dry coating procedure that limits the extent of powder attrition, while providing the most consistent improvement in angle of repose (AOR). The magnetically assisted impaction coating (MAIC) was considered as a model dry-coater for pharmaceutical powders; ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and ascorbic acid. Dry coated drug powders were characterized by AOR, particle size as a function of dispersion pressure, particle size distribution, conditioned bulk density (CBD), Carr index (CI), flow function coefficient (FFC), cohesion coefficient using different instruments, including a shear cell in the Freeman FT4 powder rheometer, and Hansen flowability index. Substantial improvement was observed in all the measured properties after dry coating relative to the uncoated powders, such that each powder moved from a poorer to a better flow classification and showed improved dispersion. The material intrinsic property such as cohesion, plotted as a function of particle size, gave a trend similar to those of bulk flow properties, AOR and CI. Property improvement is also illustrated in a phase map of inverse cohesion (or FFC) as a function of bulk density, which also indicated a significant positive shift due to dry coating. It is hoped that such phase maps are useful in manufacturing decisions regarding the need for dry coating, which will allow moving from wet granulation to roller compaction or to direct compression based formulations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",22197769,

To assess treatment effects, we carried out direct comparison using a random effects model and adjusted indirect comparison. RESULTS: At total of 34 studies (3,041 patients) were included. In direct comparisons, both CPAP and NIPPV reduced the risk of death (relative risk [RR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.93; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.58-1.10; respectively) compared with ST, although only CPAP had a significant effect. There were no significant differences between NIPPV and CPAP. Pooled results of direct and adjusted indirect comparisons showed that compared with ST, both CPAP and NIPPV significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.89; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.97; respectively).

Subsequent to this appraisal, randomised controlled trial (RCT) data for raltitrexed plus cisplatin and comparing chemotherapy to active symptom control (ASC) has become available, allowing a more complete analysis of the comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of first-line chemotherapy in MPM. METHODS: An adjusted indirect comparison is used to estimate the relative efficacy of raltitrexed plus cisplatin and pemetrexed plus cisplatin. A cost-effectiveness model is used to assess the lifetime costs and health outcomes associated with these comparators and ASC. Patient level data from the EORTC 08983 trial are used to estimate baseline progression and survival rates. Relative treatment effects are taken from RCTs; cost and utility data from the literature. RESULTS: Raltitrexed plus cisplatin and pemetrexed plus cisplatin were not found to be statistically significantly different with respect to overall response, progression free survival or overall survival. The cost-effectiveness analysis found raltitrexed plus cisplatin to be cost-effective at a cost per quality adjusted life year of £13,454 compared to cisplatin and £27,360 compared to ASC. Pemetrexed plus cisplatin is dominated by raltitrexed plus cisplatin as the raltitrexed combination offers marginally higher quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs) at a substantially lower total cost.

These targeted therapies are currently competing to be primary choice; hence, in the absence of direct head-to-head comparison, there is a need for valid indirect comparison assessment. METHODS: Standard indirect comparison methods were applied to independent review PFS data of the pivotal Phase III trials, to determine indirect treatment comparison hazard-ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). As BEV+IFN and SUN have been compared to IFN, indirect comparison was enabled by the common IFN comparator arms. As PAZ was compared to placebo (PLA), a connector trial (IFN vs PLA) was required for the indirect comparison to BEV+IFN. Sensitivity analyses taking into account real-life influence of patient compliance on clinical outcomes were performed. RESULTS: The indirect efficacy comparison resulted in a statistically nonsignificant PFS difference of BEV+IFN vs SUN (HR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.78-1.45; P = 0.73) and of BEV+IFN vs PAZ (range based on different connector trials; HR: 0.74-1.03; P = 0.34-0.92). Simulating real-life patient compliance and its effectiveness impact showed an increased tendency towards BEV+IFN without reaching statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There is no statistically significant PFS difference between BEV+IFN and TKIs in first-line mRCC. These findings imply that additional treatment decision criteria such as tolerability and therapy sequencing need to be considered to guide treatment decisions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21935329,PMC3169982

Due to this reason, it is important to understand the risks involved with the drug class and individual statins. AIM: We conducted a meta-analysis and employed indirect comparisons to identify differing risk effects across statins. DESIGN: We included any randomized clinical trial (RCT) of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin used for cardiovascular disease event prevention. The main outcome was adverse events [all-cause mortality, cancers, rhabdomylosis, diabetes, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) increases beyond the upper limit of normal]. In order to evaluate the relative effects of each drug on adverse events, we calculated adjusted indirect comparisons of the adverse-event outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-two trials involving 159,458 patients met our inclusion criteria. Overall, statin treatments significantly increased the rate of diabetes when compared to controls (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02-1.16) and elevated AST (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.04-1.66) and ALT (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.11-1.48) levels when compared to controls. Using indirect comparisons, we also found that atorvastatin significantly elevated AST levels compared to pravastatin (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.13-4.29) and simvastatin significantly increased CK levels when compared to rosuvastatin (OR: 4.39; 95% CI: 1.01-19.07). Higher dose studies had increased risk of AST elevations. DISCUSSION: Although statins are generally well tolerated, there are risks associated with almost all drugs. With few exceptions, statins appear to exert a similar risk across individual drugs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21920996,

Previously, we clarified the structures of serotype 7 GPL and two methyltransferase genes (orfA and orfB) in serotype 12 GPL. This study elucidated the chemical structure, biosynthesis gene, and host innate immune response of serotype 13 GPL. The oligosaccharide (OSE) structure of serotype 13 GPL was determined to be 4-2'-hydroxypropanoyl-amido-4,6-dideoxy-β-hexose-(1 → 3)-4-O-methyl-α-L-rhamnose-(1 → 3)-α-L-rhamnose-(1 → 3)-α-L-rhamnose-(1 → 2)-α-L-6-deoxy-talose by using chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. The structure of the serotype 13 GPL was different from those of serotype 7 and 12 GPLs only in O-methylations. We found a relationship between the structure and biosynthesis gene cluster. M. intracellulare serotypes 12 and 13 have a 1.95-kb orfA-orfB gene responsible for 3-O-methylation at the terminal hexose, orfB, and 4-O-methylation at the rhamnose next to the terminal hexose, orfA. The serotype 13 orfB had a nonfunctional one-base missense mutation that modifies serotype 12 GPL to serotype 13 GPL. Moreover, the native serotype 13 GPL was multiacetylated and recognized via Toll-like receptor 2. The findings presented here imply that serotypes 7, 12, and 13 are phylogenetically related and confirm that acetylation of the GPL is necessary for host recognition. This study will promote better understanding of the structure-function relationships of GPLs and may open a new avenue for the prevention of MAIC infections.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",21856857,PMC3187198

The University of Aberdeen Health Technology Assessment Group were commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG); the role of the ERG being to appraise the manufacturer's submission and to produce an independent report. This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The manufacturer considered that denosumab would be appropriate for patients unable to take, comply with or tolerate oral bisphosphonates. Comparator treatments selected for the submission were, therefore, 'no treatment', raloxifene, strontium ranelate, intravenous zoledronic acid, intravenous ibandronate and teriparatide. The main effectiveness evidence for denosumab was derived from a large randomized controlled trial comparing denosumab with placebo. Given by subcutaneous injection at 6-monthly intervals for 3 years, denosumab reduced the incidence of hip fracture by 40%, and reduced the incidence of clinical vertebral fracture by 69%. An indirect treatment comparison was used to derive adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for different types of fracture for each comparator versus placebo. The RRs (95% CI) applied for denosumab were 0.316 (0.208, 0.478) for clinical vertebral fracture, 0.605 (0.373, 0.983) for hip fracture and 0.842 (0.638, 1.110) for wrist fracture. Despite a number of concerns surrounding the methodology of the indirect comparison, the ERG was satisfied with the robustness of the effect estimates. The RR estimates were applied in a good-quality Markov model that took account of drug costs, administration and monitoring costs, costs associated with fractures, and long-term nursing home costs. Utility weights were used to adjust time spent in fracture states, allowing QALYs to be estimated. The base-case analysis was conducted for women aged 70 years with a T-score of -2.5 or less and no prior fracture, and women aged 70 years with a T-score of -2.5 or less with a prior fragility fracture. Subgroup analyses based on T-score and independent clinical risk factors were also undertaken. Applying a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £30 000 per QALY, the manufacturer's results suggested that denosumab would offer a cost-effective alternative to all treatment comparators for the primary and secondary prevention of fractures. The ERG was concerned about an assumption that denosumab would be administered in general practice at the average cost of two standard GP visits a year. As a result, the ERG requested some further sensitivity analysis and undertook some further modelling, applying an assumption that denosumab would be provided primarily in secondary care. This modification altered the cost effectiveness of denosumab versus 'no treatment' (in women with no prior fragility fracture) and zoledronic acid. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that, as a treatment option for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures, denosumab should be recommended only in post-menopausal women at increased risk of fracture who cannot comply with the special instructions for administering oral bisphosphonates, or have an intolerance of, or contraindication to, those treatments. For primary prevention, the Appraisal Committee also stipulated specific levels of fracture risk at which denosumab is recommended.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_original_article",21854080,

The aim of this study was to compare 12-week glycaemic control with vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily versus sitagliptin 50 or 100 mg once daily in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Randomized trials of vildagliptin or sitagliptin in Japanese patients were identified from the literature. Individual patient data were obtained for vildagliptin trials. In the absence of a head-to-head randomized trial, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison was conducted by weighting individual patients from vildagliptin trials to match average baseline characteristics published for sitagliptin trials, including age, sex, body mass index, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and diabetes duration. After matching, HbA(1c) change from baseline to week 12, the primary endpoint in each trial, was compared between balanced populations treated with vildagliptin and sitagliptin. Separate comparisons were conducted for vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily versus sitagliptin 50 mg and 100 mg once daily. RESULTS: Two trials of vildagliptin and three trials of sitagliptin were identified for Japanese patients. Across all included trials, a total of 264 patients were treated with vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily, 235 were treated with sitagliptin 50 mg once daily and 145 were treated with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily. Mean baseline HbA(1c) ranged from 7.4% to 7.8% per trial. Before matching, significant (p < 0.05) cross-trial differences included lower mean HbA(1c) (by 0.2-0.3%) and higher FPG (by 5-13 mg/dL) in vildagliptin trials. After matching, all baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. Combining matched trials, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily was associated with significantly greater absolute HbA(1c) reduction by 0.28% compared with sitagliptin 50 mg once daily (95% CI 0.15, 0.41; p < 0.001) and by 0.35% compared with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily (95% CI 0.07, 0.62; p = 0.013). CONCLUSION: After adjusting for baseline differences among trials of vildagliptin and sitagliptin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily was associated with significantly greater HbA(1c) reduction than sitagliptin 50 mg or 100 mg once daily.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",21819162,

To date, these drugs have not been compared in head-to-head trials. OBJECTIVE: To review systematically the evidence of clinical effectiveness of multikinase inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and, via an indirect meta-analysis, to determine an optimal treatment among these agents. METHODS: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, and Cochrane controlled trials register databases was performed. All RCTs of multikinase inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib) used to treat mRCC were included. The study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by 2 reviewers, with all disagreements being resolved by consensus. The effects of multikinase inhibitors on progression-free survival (PFS) were compared using an indirect treatment comparison method with INF-α or placebo as a comparator. RESULTS: Four studies were included. Two studies examined sunitinib or sorafenib versus IFN-α, and the other 2 studies investigated sorafenib or pazopanib versus placebo. Compared with placebo, 2 interventions reported improvement for PFS (sorafenib: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.44, P = 0.01; pazopanib: HR = 0.46, P = 0.0001), whereas only sunitinib improved PFS over IFN-α (HR = 0.539, P = 0.001). An indirect comparison suggests that sunitinib is likely to demonstrate greater clinical benefit than sorafenib in terms of PFS (HR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.316-0.713; P < 0.001), using IFN-α as the comparator. Sorafenib was not statistically different from pazopanib using placebo as the comparator in the indirect comparison (HR = 0.957; 95% CI, 0.657-1.39; P = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Some multikinase inhibitors have a favorably reported PFS for patients with mRCC compared with results using IFN-α or placebo. Our findings suggest that sunitinib might offer some clinical benefit over sorafenib in terms of PFS. No statistical difference was found between sorafenib and pazopanib treatments. However, these conclusions are based on 2 indirect comparisons of single RCTs. More RCTs are required to confirm these findings and investigate the clinical effectiveness of multikinase inhibitors in the treatment of mRCC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21704235,

We previously devised a murine metal allergy model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as an adjuvant. LPS reduces the minimum allergy-inducing concentration (MAIC) of metals at both the sensitization and the elicitation steps. OBJECTIVES: Here, we examined allergic cross-reactivity among some metals in this murine model, and compared the effects of ultrapure (99·99% or more) and low purity (93-99%) metal salts. METHODS: A mixture of a metal salt and Escherichia coli LPS was injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice (0·25 mL per mouse). Ten days later, metal salts (with or without LPS) were challenged to ear pinnas (20 μL per ear), and ear swelling was measured. RESULTS: Among the ultrapure metals tested (Ni, Pd, Co, Cr, Cu and Au), only Ni and Pd cross-reacted. In this cross-reaction, their MAICs were at the same level. Combined challenge with Ni and Pd at sub-MAICs (but not at higher concentrations) produced an additive effect. Surprisingly, mice sensitized with low purity Ni reacted to all the tested low purity metals (Ni, Pd, Co and Cr), and the low purity metals were shown to contain contaminant metals. CONCLUSIONS: In our model: (i) Ni and Pd (members of the same group in the periodic table of elements) cross-react with each other, (ii) this cross-reaction may depend on true and false antigens forming metal-protein complexes with similar spatial geometries, (iii) Co, Cr, Cu and Au do not cross-react with each other, (iv) in low purity materials, trace contaminant metals may be sufficient to evoke allergy, and thus (v) high purity metal salts should be considered for use in clinical patch testing.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",21692768,

METHODS: An initial literature search revealed no suitable head-to-head trials between budesonide/formoterol and salmeterol/fluticasone and therefore a systematic review was conducted to find randomised controlled trials providing data for input into an adjusted indirect comparison of the two combination treatments using placebo as a common comparator. The Bucher adjusted indirect comparison method was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Eight salmeterol/fluticasone trials and four budesonide/formoterol trials were identified as being relevant for the analyses. The proportion of patients experiencing a pneumonia adverse event was significantly lower with budesonide/formoterol than salmeterol/fluticasone (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.80). The proportion of patients experiencing a pneumonia serious adverse event was also significantly lower with budesonide/formoterol than salmeterol/fluticasone (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.86). However, there were too few events to draw any firm conclusions on pneumonia-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the indirect comparison support the hypothesis that budesonide/formoterol is associated with fewer pneumonia events than salmeterol/fluticasone in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The limitations of the analysis are that the results from a single study, TORCH, have a large bearing on the overall findings of the analysis, and that there is heterogeneity in the length and the dosing of the included studies, although it does not appear that heterogeneity affected the reported results. Another important limitation is the lack of predefined diagnostic standards for pneumonia in these studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21676119,

DATA SOURCES: To identify published studies, we searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and reference lists of included studies. We also searched the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research website for additional unpublished data and dossiers of information submitted by 5 pharmaceutical manufacturers. REVIEW METHODS: Study selection, data abstraction, validity assessment, grading the strength of the evidence, and data synthesis were all carried out according to standard Drug Effectiveness Review Project review methods. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the strength of evidence evaluating the comparative benefits or harms of these drugs to treat neuropathic pain was low to moderate. Based on a small number of short-term trials directly comparing the drugs in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, the evidence did not support a statistically significant difference in response (50% reduction in pain) or withdrawal due to adverse events with gabapentin, pregabalin, and lamotrigine compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Oralpregabalin was similar to lidocaine 5% medicated patchin rate of response, but resulted in more patients withdrawing due to an adverse event. Adjusted indirect comparisons of placebo-controlled trials suggested that duloxetine, pregabalin, and gabapentin were superior to lacosamide and lamotrigine, but no difference in withdrawal from study due to adverse events was found. In these analyses, differences were not found between pregabalin, duloxetine, and gabapentin or comparisons of 5% lidocaine patch and amitriptyline or gabapentin. Tricyclic antidepressants caused more dry mouth than pregabalin or gabapentin while gabapentin and pregabalin resulted in higher rates of ataxia. In patients with cancer-related neuropathic pain who were taking opioids, there was no difference in pain relief with low-dose gabapentin compared with low-dose imipramine. Monotherapy with either drug was insufficient for pain relief. In patients with spinal cord injury, gabapentin was more effective for pain relief than amitriptyline. The difference was significant only in the subgroup of patients with the highest levels of depression. In patients with central poststroke pain, there was no difference between amitriptyline and carbamazepine. There was no direct evidence in patients with HIV-associated neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis, complex regional pain syndrome, postmastectomy pain syndrome, phantom limb pain, or traumatic nerve injury pain. Evidence for comparative effectiveness in patients with types of neuropathic pain other than diabetic or postherpetic was insufficient to assess comparative safety.

The current analysis indirectly compares the overall survival (OS) benefit of everolimus and sorafenib as second-line treatment options. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-arm sorafenib study is selected as a basis to match an everolimus sunitinib-refractory subpopulation of the RECORD-1 trial. Only patients with clear cell histology are included. An adjusted matching approach is taken where 1000 repeated random samples matched to the sorafenib population on risk score distribution are produced, and a 95% CI around the mean of all sampled median OS is generated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures include adjusted median OS and progression-free survival. RESULTS: In all, 45 clear cell histology sorafenib patients and 1000 samples of N=41 sunitinib-refractory everolimus patients are considered for analysis. After adjusted matching, the estimated median OS benefit is 32.0 [corrected] weeks (95% CI: 22, 64) and 81.5 weeks (95% CI:78, 86) for sorafenib and everolimus patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that sunitinib-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients treated with everolimus may experience significantly improved OS outcomes compared to those treated with sorafenib. However, because this is not a randomized controlled trial, the results should be interpreted as those from an observational study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Say they use Matching adjusted indirect comparisons, cite the STC and MAIC papers, but are actually doing something else, that is resampling populations after matching baseline characteristics, and using only patient-level data.

METHODS: Survival outcomes were compared between subgroups of East Asian patients receiving treatments of either bevacizumab + cisplatin-based chemotherapy or pemetrexed + cisplatin using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison approach. Patient-level data were used to derive a new group with similar characteristics compared to those reported in a phase III clinical trial evaluating pemetrexed + cisplatin therapy. Exclusions to the SAiL data included those with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2, those with mixed cell histology, non-East Asians and those who did not receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In total 1000 samples of the pre-matched analysis set of the SAiL data were selected that resulted in equal distributions of the ECOG PS and gender matching variables selected and evaluated for a progression-free survival (PFS) outcome. RESULTS: Median PFS was longer for patients treated with bevacizumab-based therapy (7.4 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.7-8.2) versus pemetrexed + cisplatin (6.4 months; 95% CI N/A) among non-squamous East Asian NSCLC patients.

In the absence of evidence from head-to-head trials, an adjusted indirect treatment comparison (ITC) approach was selected to compare these treatments. METHODS: BevCG and CP treatments have been compared in their relative effects versus their common comparator, the CG treatment. Outcomes from the ITC were used in a statistical model to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the two treatments. The non-proportional hazards log-logistic, accelerated failure time model was selected as it provided the best fit. The ITC hazard ratio (HR) was conservatively adjusted to match what was observed between the cumulative hazard functions until the end of the Avastin in Lung trial follow-up period. RESULTS: The ITC analysis suggests that patients treated with Bev-based treatment can expect more favorable outcomes in terms of both PFS and OS (PFS HR=0.71 and OS HR=0.41). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses of PFS and OS HR showed that HR values below 1 are likely to occur in 82% of patients for PFS HR and in 94% of patients for OS HR. CONCLUSION: BevCG can be considered a more effective therapy than CP for NSCLC patients in East Asia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21585704,

This assumption is implausible when hazard functions intersect, and can have a huge impact on decisions based on comparisons of expected survival, such as cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: As an alternative to network meta-analysis of survival data in which the treatment effect is represented by the constant hazard ratio, a multi-dimensional treatment effect approach is presented. With fractional polynomials the hazard functions of interventions compared in a randomized controlled trial are modeled, and the difference between the parameters of these fractional polynomials within a trial are synthesized (and indirectly compared) across studies. RESULTS: The proposed models are illustrated with an analysis of survival data in non-small-cell lung cancer. Fixed and random effects first and second order fractional polynomials were evaluated. CONCLUSION: (Network) meta-analysis of survival data with models where the treatment effect is represented with several parameters using fractional polynomials can be more closely fitted to the available data than meta-analysis based on the constant hazard ratio.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""May give idea to adapt MAIC to problems faced with time-to-event outcomes""]}",21548941,PMC3112194

The purpose of this study was to indirectly compare rates of major molecular response (MMR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival by month 12 with nilotinib and dasatinib treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP. METHODS: Individual patient data from a randomized trial of nilotinib vs. imatinib (ENESTnd) and published summary data from a separate randomized trial of dasatinib vs. imatinib (DASISION) were utilized. A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was conducted by weighting individual patients treated with nilotinib to match baseline characteristics reported for dasatinib-treated patients, including age, gender, ECOG performance status and hematology lab values. After matching, efficacy outcomes were compared for patients treated with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily vs. dasatinib 100 mg once daily. Patients randomized to imatinib 400 mg once daily in each trial were used to assess the adequacy of the matching. RESULTS: Before matching, patients randomized to nilotinib in ENESTnd (n = 273) were older, with a lower median platelet count and more favorable performance status compared to patients randomized to dasatinib in DASISION (n = 259). After matching, all baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups. Matched patients treated with nilotinib vs. dasatinib experienced significantly higher rates of MMR (56.8 vs. 45.9%, p = 0.014) and overall survival (99.5 vs. 97.3%, p = 0.046) and numerically higher rates of PFS (98.8 vs. 96.5%). Matched imatinib arms showed no statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences in these outcomes. LIMITATIONS: Baseline measures unavailable in one or both trials could not be matched. Adverse event rates were not formally compared across trials due to differences in reporting. CONCLUSION: Nilotinib was associated with significantly higher rates of MMR and overall survival compared with dasatinib by month 12 in the treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Included""}",21524239,

RESULTS: We identified published results of randomized controlled trials from the United States in which HIV-infected patients received rifabutin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or placebo for prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). We extracted the number of subjects, follow-up time, primary MAC events, mean CD4 count, and proportion of subjects on mono or dual antiretroviral therapy (ART) from each study. We derived the efficacy of each drug using adjusted indirect comparisons and, when possible, by direct comparisons. Five articles satisfied our inclusion criteria. Using direct comparison, we estimated the efficacies of rifabutin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin compared to placebo to be 53% (95% CI, 48-61%), 66% (95% CI, 61-74%), and 66% (95% CI, 60-81%), respectively. Using adjusted indirect calculations, the efficacy of rifabutin compared to placebo ranged from 41% to 44%. The adjusted indirect efficacies of clarithromycin and azithromycin were estimated to be 73% and 72%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate estimates of specific drug dosages as compared to placebo are important for policy and implementation research. This study illustrates a simple method of adjusting for differences in study populations by using indirect comparisons in the absence of head-to-head HIV clinical trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21388558,PMC3065397

For patients in the control group, transcutaneous nerve electrical stimulation (TENS) of Pishu (BL 20), Weishu (BL 21) and Sanjiaoshu (BL 22) was given for 20 min, followed by acupuncture of Neiguan (PC 6), Zhongwan (CV 12), Qihai (CV6), Tianshu (ST 25), etc., plus abdominal TDP irradiation and pellet-pressure of otopoints; Wei (MA-IC), Jiaogan (MA-AH 7), Neifenmi (MA-IC 3), Sanjiao (MA-IC 4), Pizhixia (MA-AT 1), etc. For patients of the treatment group, in addition to the treatment mentioned above, acupoints Baihui (GV 20), Yintang (EX-HN 3) and scalp-point Weiqu (Stomach Area) for adjusting the mental activity were punctured. The treatment was conducted once daily, 5 times a week and continuously for 4 weeks. Changes of the psychological status including Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores, and gastric drainage volume/d were recorded. Results In comparison with pre-treatment, the HAMD and HAMA scores of both the treatment group and the control group after the treatment were decreased significantly (P < 0.01), and the therapeutic effects of the treatment group in reducing HAMD and HAMA scores were evidently superior to those of the control group (both P < 0.05). The gastric drainage volume/d in the two groups both decreased after the treatment. Of the two 10 cases in the treatment and control groups, 10 and 8 were cured, 0 and 2 were improved.

This has resulted in failure to directly identify the best treatment with standard methods. Mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis allows one to perform simultaneous inference regarding all treatments and select the best among them. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We applied MTC models to the Meta-Analyses of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in HNC, which pooled individual patient data concerning more than 24,000 patients involved in 102 trials. Fixed- and random-effects models, models with or without consistency factors, possibly adapted to multiarm trials are discussed. RESULTS: Altered fractionated concomitant chemoradiotherapy (AF-CRT) leads to the highest probability of survival in nonmetastatic HNC. The probability that AF-CRT is the best treatment is 94% with random-effects models. There was no relevant inconsistency. When only the most recent trials were selected, AF-CRT and concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) were the two best treatments. AF-CRT remains better than CRT but with a lower posterior probability. CONCLUSION: MTC is a powerful method for investigating networks of randomized trials. Homogeneity, similarity of trial designs, populations, and the consistency of the network should be thoroughly checked.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21330105,

METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of anticytokine agents in combination with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) after 6 months of treatment, using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, in patients with RA who have shown inadequate response to DMARD including methotrexate. Indirect treatment comparisons were carried out by a multiple-treatment Bayesian random-effects metaanalysis. Data were analyzed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Noninferiority of CZP was assessed in comparison with a predefined equivalence margin of 5%. RESULTS: Nineteen placebo-controlled studies were identified: 14 evaluated the efficacy of 5 anti-TNF-α agents (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, CZP) and 5 evaluated efficacy of 2 anti-interleukin agents (anakinra, tocilizumab). Every treatment showed significant efficacy versus placebo in individual studies. The multiple-treatment metaanalysis showed a highest OR for CZP on ACR20 response. Metaanalysis indicates that the efficacy of CZP according to ACR20 response is superior to that of infliximab, adalimumab, and anakinra, and equivalent or superior to that of etanercept, golimumab, and tocilizumab. According to ACR50 response, the efficacy of CZP is equivalent or superior to that of all other anticytokines. CONCLUSION: Results of this original multiple-treatment Bayesian metaanalysis indicate that certolizumab pegol is at least as efficacious as the preexisting antirheumatic anticytokine biotherapies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Seams interesting in term of the fancyness of the NMA methodology used (Multiple-treatment, Bayesian, Markov Model)""]}",21239748,

We aimed to systematically compare their relative benefits and harms through meta-analysis, and adjusted indirect comparison. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, trial registries and regulatory documents through May 2009 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of dabigatran (150 and 220 mg daily) and rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) compared with enoxaparin (40-60 mg daily) in elective orthopaedic surgery. We used random effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the outcomes of total venous thromboembolism, VTE (deep venous thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism and all-cause mortality), and haemorrhagic adverse events (major and clinically relevant non-major bleeds). Adjusted indirect comparison was used for the pooled RRs of dabigatran and rivaroxaban with enoxaparin as the common control. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban was superior to enoxaparin for the prevention of venous thromoboembolism (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43-0.73, P<0.0001), with a trend for increased haemorrhage (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94-1.69, P=0.13). Dabigatran was not superior to enoxaparin for prevention of VTE (RR 1.12, 95% 0.97-1.29, P=0.12), and did not reduce haemorrhage risk (RR 1.10, 95% 0.90-1.35, P=0.32). Adjusted indirect comparison showed that rivaroxaban was superior to dabigatran in preventing VTE, RR 0.50 (95% CI 0.37-0.68), but with a slight trend towards increased haemorrhage RR 1.14 (95% CI 0.80-1.64). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban may be more effective than dabigatran for prevention of VTE after elective orthopaedic surgery but might also slightly increase the risk of haemorrhage.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21198726,

DESIGN: Comparative effectiveness analysis using an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) method in a Bayesian framework. PATIENTS: Adults with rheumatoid arthritis who had been enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and had never failed biologic DMARD therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two random-effects logistic regression models, representing 6 and 12 months of treatment, were created using RCTs identified in a literature search. Twenty-three RCTs (11,589 patients) were included in the 6-month model and 10 RCTs (6051 patients) in the 12-month model. Nine biologic DMARDs in five therapeutic drug classes were included in the 6-month model, and six biologic DMARDs in three classes were included in the 12-month model. Our efficacy end point was the American College of Rheumatology 50% improvement criteria. In the 6-month model, all biologic DMARDs and methotrexate were significantly more efficacious than placebo and ranked in the following order: certolizumab (median log odds ratio [OR] 2.6), tocilizumab (1.7), rituximab (1.6), infliximab (1.6), etanercept (1.4), adalimumab (1.4), golimumab (1.4), abatacept (1.2), anakinra (1.0), and methotrexate (0.8). Of 45 pairwise comparisons, certolizumab was significantly more efficacious than methotrexate, but no other comparisons were significant. The rank order in the 12-month analysis was certolizumab (median log OR 2.0), rituximab (2.0), adalimumab (1.4), infliximab (1.4), etanercept (0.9), abatacept (0.6), and methotrexate (0.8). Of the 21 pairwise comparisons, none were significant. The results of the model using therapeutic class revealed that each class was more efficacious than placebo. In pairwise comparisons, each class was more efficacious than methotrexate, but none was more efficacious than another. CONCLUSION: Use of emerging ITC methods enabled us to compare the efficacy of biologic DMARDs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the absence of direct head-to-head comparison trials. Our methods enabled us to rank order these treatments. Further analyses by drug and by therapeutic class suggest that biologic DMARDs are similarly efficacious.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21182357,

While all biologicals have proven effective in trials, very limited direct comparisons are available. The objective of the present work was to compare the efficacy of biologicals (anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents, rituximab, abatacept, tocilizumab) in patients with RA with active disease and (i) an inadequate response (IR) to methotrexate (IR-MTX), (ii) an IR to anti-TNF agents (IR-anti-TNFs) using indirect comparisons. METHODS: Randomised clinical trials were identified examining the efficacy of a biological agent in RA at 6 months in patients with an IR-MTX or with an IR-anti-TNF. To compare the relative efficacy of biologicals, adjusted indirect comparison meta-analytic methods to estimate the ORs of achieving a 50% improvement according to American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR50) response at 6 months were used. RESULTS: A total of 18 published trials and 1 abstract were included in the analyses. In IR-MTX, anti-TNFs had the same probability of reaching an ACR50 compared to 'non-anti-TNF biologicals' taken together (OR 1.30, 95 % CI 0.91 to 1.86). However, when compared to specific biological agents, anti-TNFs demonstrated a higher probability of reaching an ACR50 than abatacept (OR 1.52, 95 % CI 1.0 to 2.28), but not in comparison to rituximab and tocilizumab. In IR-anti-TNF, no significant differences existed between rituximab, tocilizumab, abatacept and golimumab. [corrected] CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials of patients with IR-MTX, anti-TNFs demonstrated a higher probability of achieving an ACR50 response than abatacept. In IR-anti-TNF, no difference was found between rituximab, tocimizumab, abatacept and golimumab.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21097801,

METHODS: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, www.clinicalstudyresults.org and www.clinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized pharmacological placebo-controlled trials until 30 May 2010. Outcomes of interest were symptom reduction [pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL)] and acceptability (total drop-out rates). We performed a meta-analysis of each drug vs placebo using a random-effects model and adjusted indirect analyses of the three drugs. Methodological quality was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Ten AMT studies (612 patients), four DLX studies (1411 patients) and five MLN studies (4129 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The reported methodological quality of most AMT trials was poor, that of DLX and MLN were high. The three drugs were superior to placebo except DLX for fatigue, MLN for sleep disturbance and AMT for HRQOL. The significant effects of AMT and DLX were small and those of MLN not substantial. In adjusted indirect comparisons, AMT was superior to DLX and MLN in reduction of pain, sleep disturbances, fatigue and limitations of HRQOL. DLX was superior to MLN in reducing pain, sleep disturbances and limitations of HRQOL. MLN was superior to DLX in reducing fatigue. There were no significant differences in acceptability of the three drugs. CONCLUSIONS: AMT cannot be regarded as the gold standard of FMS therapy with antidepressants because of the methodological limitations of its trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",21078630,

Evidence from comparisons of competing interventions is increasingly important, although head-to-head studies are seldom available to inform decisions. In this article, we describe the simulated treatment comparison (STC) approach to incorporating 'missing arms' into an existing trial. This approach yields a simulated head-to-head trial and can address many of the differences among source trials. It provides inputs for economic models and can inform decision makers until actual trial data are available. A simulation is constructed to replicate an index trial, including enrolment, randomization and follow-up of patients. The simulation is driven by predictive equations derived from the index trial. Separate data for the comparators are used to calibrate the index equations to reflect the alternative interventions. The simulation is used to add the missing arms to the index trial and estimate the results that would have been obtained in a head-to-head trial. The STC can also be used to estimate results in various settings and populations and to explore variations in the trial design. An STC offers a way to derive comparative effectiveness in the absence of direct trial evidence and a platform to test design features that may help in planning future head-to-head studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological",20831304,

Indirect cross-trial treatment comparisons are possible, but can be biased by cross-trial differences in patient characteristics. Using only published aggregate data, adjustment for such biases may be impossible. Although individual patient data (IPD) would permit adjustment, they are rarely available for all trials. However, many researchers have the opportunity to access IPD for trials of one treatment, a new drug for example, but only aggregate data for trials of comparator treatments. We propose a method that leverages all available data in this setting by adjusting average patient characteristics in trials with IPD to match those reported for trials without IPD. Treatment outcomes, including continuous, categorical and censored time-to-event outcomes, can then be compared across balanced trial populations. The proposed method is illustrated by a comparison of adalimumab and etanercept for the treatment of psoriasis. IPD from trials of adalimumab versus placebo (n = 1025) were re-weighted to match the average baseline characteristics reported for a trial of etanercept versus placebo (n = 330). Re-weighting was based on the estimated propensity of enrolment in the adalimumab versus etanercept trials. Before matching, patients in the adalimumab trials had lower mean age, greater prevalence of psoriatic arthritis, less prior use of systemic treatment or phototherapy, and a smaller mean percentage of body surface area affected than patients in the etanercept trial. After matching, these and all other available baseline characteristics were well balanced across trials. Symptom improvements of ≥75% and ≥90% (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score at week 12) were experienced by an additional 17.2% and 14.8% of adalimumab-treated patients compared with the matched etanercept-treated patients (respectively, both p < 0.001). Mean percentage PASI score improvements from baseline were also greater for adalimumab than for etanercept at weeks 4, 8 and 12 (all p < 0.05). Matching adjustment ensured that this indirect comparison was not biased by differences in mean baseline characteristics across trials, supporting the conclusion that adalimumab was associated with significantly greater symptom reduction than etanercept for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: methodological | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""to decide whether to keep it or not, because first example but not a real application""]}",20831302,

Recent data suggest the superiority of prasugrel or ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. However, there is no comparison of prasugrel vs. ticagrelor. We performed an adjusted indirect meta-analysis comparing prasugrel vs. ticagrelor for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). METHODS: Randomized trials were searched in PubMed. The primary end-point was the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. Odds ratios (OR) were computed (95% confidence intervals). RESULTS: Three trial (32,893) patients were included. Overall, either prasugrel or ticagrelor appeared significantly superior to clopidogrel for the 12-month risk of death, MI or stroke (OR=0.83 [0.77-0.89], p<0.001), death (OR=0.83 [0.74-0.93], p=0.001), MI (OR=0.79 [0.73-0.86], p<0.001), and stent thrombosis (OR=0.61 [0.51-0.74], p<0.001), without any significant difference in stroke or major bleeding (both p>0.05), despite more frequent drug discontinuation (OR=1.12 [1.05-1.19], p<0.001). Head-to-head comparison of prasugrel vs. ticagrelor showed no significant differences in overall death, MI, stroke, or their composite (all p>0.05). Prasugrel was associated with a significantly lower risk of stent thrombosis (OR=0.64 [0.43-0.93], p=0.020). Ticagrelor was associated with a significantly lower risk of any major bleeding (OR=1.43 [1.10-1.85], p=0.007), and major bleeding associated with bypass grafting (OR=4.30 [1.73-10.6], p=0.002). However, the more clinically relevant risk of major bleeding not related to bypass surgery was similar with either prasugrel or ticagrelor (OR=1.06 [0.77-1.45], p=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Prasugrel and ticagrelor are superior to clopidogrel for ACS. Head-to-head comparison suggests similar efficacy and safety of prasugrel and ticagrelor, but prasugrel appears more protective from stent thrombosis, while causing more bleedings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",20828843,

We previously found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a cell-surface component of gram-negative bacteria) markedly promotes Ni allergy in a murine model. Establishing the minimum concentration or amount of Ni needed to induce allergic responses may help us to prevent or reduce such responses. OBJECTIVES: Using the above murine model, we examined the influence of LPS on the minimum allergy-inducing concentrations of Ni (Ni-MAICs) at the sensitization step and at the elicitation step. METHODS: BALB/c mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture containing various concentrations of LPS and NiCl(2). Ten days later, their ear pinnas were challenged intradermally with a mixture containing various concentrations of LPS and NiCl(2), and ear swelling was measured. RESULTS: Without LPS, the Ni-MAICs at the sensitization and elicitation steps were around 1×10(-2) mol L(-1) and 1×10(-5) mol L(-1) , respectively. Sensitization with NiCl(2) + LPS did not alter the value at elicitation. Surprisingly, LPS markedly reduced these Ni-MAICs (to around 1×10(-6) molL(-1) at sensitization, with 25 μg mL(-1) LPS, and 1×10(-12) mol L(-1) at elicitation, with 0·5 μg mL(-1) LPS). The effect of LPS depended on its concentration and the timing of its injection. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that: (i) Ni-MAIC is higher at sensitization than at elicitation; (ii) once sensitization is established, Ni allergy can easily be induced by a low concentration of Ni; and (iii) a bacterial milieu or infection may greatly facilitate the establishment and elicitation of Ni allergy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong_topic",20825406,

As no head-to-head comparison of these treatments exists, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of the two treatments using an indirect treatment comparison approach. An indirect comparison on progression-free survival (PFS) was performed for two relevant randomised controlled trials using a well-accepted adjusted indirect comparison method. The results were used in a statistical disease model (Markov model) to extrapolate the long-term effectiveness of the two treatments. A hazard ratio of 0.83 for PFS for bevacizumab plus cisplatin and gemcitabine, was calculated suggesting that this treatment is associated with a 17% lower risk of disease progression and death compared with pemetrexed plus cisplatin treatment. The Markov model predicted that bevacizumab plus cisplatin and gemcitabine resulted in 2.5 months additional PFS and overall survival compared with pemetrexed plus cisplatin. Based on this analysis bevacizumab plus cisplatin and gemcitabine is more effective than pemetrexed plus cisplatin for patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC and should be considered as one of the preferred targeted treatments of choice for these patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: FULL_ARTICLE | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",20727460,

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of data from individual patients, with direct and indirect comparisons made on the primary outcome measure of patients' dissatisfaction. DATA SOURCES: Data were sought from the 30 randomised controlled trials identified after a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases, reference lists, and contact with experts. Raw data were available from 2814 women randomised into 17 trials (seven trials including 1359 women for first v second generation endometrial destruction; six trials including 1042 women for hysterectomy v first generation endometrial destruction; one trial including 236 women for hysterectomy v Mirena; three trials including 177 women for second generation endometrial destruction v Mirena). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials comparing hysterectomy, first and second generation endometrial destruction, and Mirena for women with heavy menstrual bleeding unresponsive to other medical treatment. RESULTS: At around 12 months, more women were dissatisfied with outcome with first generation hysteroscopic techniques than with hysterectomy (13% v 5%; odds ratio 2.46, 95% confidence interval 1.54 to 3.9, P<0.001), but hospital stay (weighted mean difference 3.0 days, 2.9 to 3.1 days, P<0.001) and time to resumption of normal activities (5.2 days, 4.7 to 5.7 days, P<0.001) were longer for hysterectomy. Unsatisfactory outcomes were comparable with first and second generation techniques (odds ratio 1.2, 0.9 to 1.6, P=0.2), although second generation techniques were quicker (weighted mean difference 14.5 minutes, 13.7 to 15.3 minutes, P<0.001) and women recovered sooner (0.48 days, 0.20 to 0.75 days, P<0.001), with fewer procedural complications. Indirect comparison suggested more unsatisfactory outcomes with second generation techniques than with hysterectomy (11% v 5%; odds ratio 2.3, 1.3 to 4.2, P=0.006). Similar estimates were seen when Mirena was indirectly compared with hysterectomy (17% v 5%; odds ratio 2.2, 0.9 to 5.3, P=0.07), although this comparison lacked power because of the limited amount of data available for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: More women are dissatisfied after endometrial destruction than after hysterectomy. Dissatisfaction rates are low after all treatments, and hysterectomy is associated with increased length of stay in hospital and a longer recovery period. Definitive evidence on effectiveness of Mirena compared with more invasive procedures is lacking.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: to_read | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc | USER-NOTES: {""Max""=>[""Look at how they got access to individual data""]}",20713583,PMC2922496

The majority of the efficacy evidence described in the manufacturer's submission is derived from a phase III open-label randomised controlled trial (RCT) known as the JMDB trial. The trial achieved its primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of pemetrexed/cisplatin to gemcitabine/cisplatin for overall survival in all patients with NSCLC. Because no other studies were found comparing pemetrexed/cisplatin with any other relevant comparator, additional efficacy evidence was presented from two phase III RCTs comparing gemcitabine/cisplatin with gemcitabine/carboplatin and docetaxel/cisplatin. The manufacturer's submission reported from its indirect comparisons' analysis that median overall survival and progression-free survival and tumour response rates were more favourable for pemetrexed/cisplatin than for any other comparator. The manufacturer did not identify any published cost-effectiveness analyses of pemetrexed for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC. Therefore economic evidence was derived solely from a de novo economic model developed by the manufacturer. A Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pemetrexed/cisplatin compared to gemcitabine/cisplatin, docetaxel/cisplatin and gemcitabine/carboplatin. The clinical data used in the economic evaluation were primarily generated from the JMDB trial, with additional data from the two further trials used in the indirect comparisons analysis. The ERG identified a series of problems with this economic model. As a result, three different versions of the model were submitted to NICE and considered by the ERG. The ICERs estimated by this final version of the model ranged from 8056 pounds to 33,065 pounds per QALY, depending on the comparator, the population and the application of a continuation rule. The ERG considered that the model required extensive modification and redesign, and should be subjected to thorough validation against the JMDB trial results. A full quality audit was also required as it was likely that further model inconsistencies may be present that had not yet been identified. The manufacturer subsequently included evidence in the form of three cost effectiveness analyses (two models and an 'in-trial' analysis), stating that a thorough validation process had been followed according to the NICE request. The very short time available to the ERG to consider the new evidence precluded a comprehensive assessment. Instead, the ERG chose to present a simple exploratory analysis combining its own survival projections with key cost estimates obtained from the JMDB trial individual patient data. Compared to gemcitabine, this resulted in ICERs ranging from 17,162 pounds to 30,142 pounds per QALY, depending on the patient population, the maximum number of cycles of chemotherapy and whether a cycle based efficacy adjustment was applied or not. The guidance issued by NICE in September 2009 states that pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is recommended as an option for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC only if the histology of the tumour has been confirmed as adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",20507803,

Evidence on the comparative benefits and harms is still accruing. The authors searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and sought unpublished data from the databases of FDA, US National Institutes for Health, and Industry through May 2009 for randomized controlled trials. Outcomes of interest were symptom reduction (pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, reduced health-related quality of life), and adverse events. 17 studies with 7,739 patients met the inclusion criteria. The 3 drugs were superior to placebo except DLX for fatigue, MLN for sleep disturbance, and PGB for depressed mood. Adjusted indirect comparisons indicated no significant differences for 30% pain relief and dropout rates due to adverse events between the 3 drugs. Significant differences in average symptom reduction were found: DLX and PGB were superior to MLN in reduction of pain and sleep disturbances. DLX was superior to MLN and PGB in reducing depressed mood. MLN and PGB were superior to DLX in reducing fatigue. The risk of headache and nausea with DLX and MLN was higher compared with PGB. The risk of diarrhea was higher with DLX compared to MLN and PGB. There is evidence for the short-term (up to 6 months) efficacy of DLX, MLN, and PGB. Differences with regard to the occurrence of the key symptoms of FMS and to drug-specific adverse events may be relevant for the choice of medication. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents comparative data on the efficacy and harms of duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin in fibromyalgia syndrome. The results can help clinicians in choosing medication since the 3 drugs have different effects on the key symptoms of fibromyalgia syndrome and differences in side effects, contraindications, and warnings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",20418173,

This paper shows how, when trial results are aggregated over different levels of covariates, the within-study covariate distribution, and the effects of both covariates and treatments can be simultaneously estimated, and ecological bias reduced. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used. The method is applied to a mixed treatment comparison evidence synthesis of six alternative approaches to post-stroke inpatient care. Results are compared with a model using only the stratified covariate data available, where each stratum is treated as a separate trial, and a model using fully aggregated data, where no covariate data are used.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",20191599,

Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) is less frequently used, and percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI) has been mostly abandoned. Robust evidence showing benefit of one therapy versus another is lacking. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence comparing RFA, PEI and PAI using meta-analytical techniques. METHODS: Literature search was undertaken until December 2008 to identify comparative studies evaluating survival, recurrence, complete necrosis of tumour and complications. Only randomized clinical trials and quasi-randomized studies were included. Adjusted indirect comparisons were made when direct comparative studies were insufficient. RESULTS: Eight studies were identified: RFA vs. PEI (n=5), PAI vs. PEI (n=2) and RFA vs. PAI vs. PEI (n=1) including 1035 patients with nine comparisons. RFA was superior to PEI for survival (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35-0.78; p=0.001), complete necrosis of tumour and local recurrence. For tumours 2 cm RFA was not significantly better than PEI. PAI did not differ significantly from PEI for survival (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.23-1.33; p=0.18), and local recurrence but required less sessions. PAI had similar outcomes, except local recurrence, to RFA in the direct and indirect comparison. CONCLUSIONS: RFA seems to be a superior ablative therapy than PEI for HCC, particularly for tumours >2 cm. PAI did not differ significantly from PEI for all the outcomes evaluated. RFA and PAI have similar survival rates. For tumours 2 cm outcome benefits comparing RFA and PEI are similar. PAI needs re-evaluation versus both PEI and RFA for tumours 2 cm.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",20149473,

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of randomised trials to evaluate the clinical outcome of DES as compared with bare-metal stent (BMS) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS AND RESULTS: We undertook a literature search until July 2009. Thirteen clinical trials met inclusion criteria, with 7,244 patients enrolled. Up to 1-year, patients treated with DES as compared with BMS experienced less target-vessel revascularisation (TVR) (5.11% versus 11.19% respectively, p<0.00001) and recurrent myocardial infarction rates (3.03% versus 3.70% respectively, p=0.02). In addition, no significant differences were found in terms of cardiac death (2.80% versus 3.52%, p=0.21) and stent thrombosis (2.65% versus 2.76%, p=0.37). Using the adjusted indirect comparison, a significant difference between sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stent was found when TVR was evaluated (OR [95% CI] =0.59 [0.40-0.89], p=0.01), without differences in other clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing PCI for STEMI, treatment with DES is associated with decreased TVR and myocardial infarction rates, without increasing cardiac death or stent thrombosis occurrence. Sirolimus-eluting stent is associated with a greater TVR reduction as compared to paclitaxel-eluting stent.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc",20142203,

In behavioral medicine, they are regularly used to derive clinical practice guidelines. Owing to an increasing complexity of data integration methods used, their interpretation has become a challenge to clinicians and researchers. This review aims to provide an accessible introduction to recent advances in the methodology and reporting style of quantitative reviews within the field of behavioral medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: Meta-analytical findings are sensitive to the precise methods used. State-of-the-art criteria for reporting of clinical trials and meta-analyses have been put forward. Further adaptations of these criteria result from recent meta-analyses of the placebo effect in clinical trials. There is a need to carefully develop and evaluate methods to deal with patient dropout and missing data. Useful methods to evaluate diagnostic test accuracy and meta-analytically evaluate direct and indirect treatment comparisons have recently been developed. SUMMARY: In the interdisciplinary field of behavioral medicine, meta-analyses are applied to evaluate interventions, diagnostic instruments, and procedures, and to derive evidence-based treatment recommendations. Criteria to improve reporting quality and methods to control for potential biases have been adapted to meet the requirements of research in behavioral medicine today.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Max""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no_paitc,methodological",20084004,
