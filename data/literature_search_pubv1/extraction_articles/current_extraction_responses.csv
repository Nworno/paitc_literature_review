Also gives an example of assessment of feasibilty and reporting this assessment, and discard one of the planned comparison because of the results of this feasibility assessment.
Also, it's an edge case for whether the main outcome of individual studies has been used in the indirect comparison (demartologic scales that seem to only vary by a little bit and seem to be used interchangeably)

Partly rely on statistics to select covariate, but don't use pvalues so the first answer doesn't apply : maybe need to reformulate it to pvalues based alone

Specify question of sample size: before or after exclusion of patients that don't meet inclusion criteria? I would say before, because it is already some kind of population adjustment ==> the sample size you would use if you didnt have access to IPD

Strictly follow and refer to guidance from NICE

Adding questions about EudraCT

Evaluates the imbalance in known prognostic factors and effect modifiers

Question about the distinction of prognostic factors and effect modifiers

Maybe reformulate in: 
	- Status of prognostic factors/effect modifiers
	- 

Reformulate 'study number' to 'study numbers'?

New questions to add: 
**
Justification for the need of a population adjusted indirect comparison: 
	- Presence of imbalance in effect modifiers between studies?
**

	- Mention imbalance in effect modifiers to justify population adjusted comparison
	- List the effect modifiers used to adjust the analysis
	- List the prognostic factors used to adjust the analysis
