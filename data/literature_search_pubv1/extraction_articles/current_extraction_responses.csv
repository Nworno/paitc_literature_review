Also gives an example of assessment of feasibilty and reporting this assessment, and discard one of the planned comparison because of the results of this feasibility assessment.
Also, it's an edge case for whether the main outcome of individual studies has been used in the indirect comparison (demartologic scales that seem to only vary by a little bit and seem to be used interchangeably)

Partly rely on statistics to select covariate, but don't use pvalues so the first answer doesn't apply : maybe need to reformulate it to pvalues based alone

Specify question of sample size: before or after exclusion of patients that don't meet inclusion criteria? I would say before, because it is already some kind of population adjustment ==> the sample size you would use if you didnt have access to IPD

New questions to add: 
**
Justification for the need of a population adjusted indirect comparison: 
	- Presence of imbalance in effect modifiers between studies?
**

	- Mention imbalance in effect modifiers to justify population adjusted comparison
	- List the effect modifiers used to adjust the analysis
	- List the prognostic factors used to adjust the analysis

Then they eventually do a sensitivity analsyis where they do 1:1 PS matching. Say they do that as a sensitivity analysis because it discarded more patients, misunderstanding that it doesn't do any more or less than their first analysis.
So eventually cannot be included in the systematic review but important to have it in mind in the flow-chart/discussion.

Method : A matching algorithm was developed whereby 1000 samples of the pre-matched analysis set of the SAiL data were selected that resulted in equal distributions of the ECOG PS and gender-matching variables selected. A distribution of survival outcomes was derived by calculating the median PFS estimate from each of the 1000 matched sets. The mean of this distribution provided the PFS point estimates, while a 95% CI was defined by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles.

**Say that they conduct unanchored because it allows to adjust for baseline characteristics better than anchored: seem to confuse Bucher unadjusted ITC and anchored MAIC?? Because unanchored MAIC is just a matter of choosing the treatment effect contrast to rely on a relative rather than an absolute endpoint. Seems like a big misunderstanding that should be clarified. Ask David and Jérôme to read it. The confusion between the two seems ever more clear when reading the first paragraph of page 2**: ''*Differences in imatinib dose-escalation regimens are related to both the trial design and conduct of the trial, and, therefore, cannot be adjusted for using NMAs or matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs).''* But in the discussion, their argument for not using anchored MAIC makes more sense, because they basically say that the control arm is not the same across trials.
