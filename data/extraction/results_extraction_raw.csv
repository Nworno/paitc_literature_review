Also gives an example of assessment of feasibilty and reporting this assessment, and discard one of the planned comparison because of the results of this feasibility assessment.
Also, it's an edge case for whether the main outcome of individual studies has been used in the indirect comparison (demartologic scales that seem to only vary by a little bit and seem to be used interchangeably)

Specify question of sample size: before or after exclusion of patients that don't meet inclusion criteria? I would say before, because it is already some kind of population adjustment ==> the sample size you would use if you didnt have access to IPD

Then they eventually do a sensitivity analsyis where they do 1:1 PS matching.

**Say that they conduct unanchored because it allows to adjust for baseline characteristics better than anchored: seem to confuse Bucher unadjusted ITC and anchored MAIC?? Because unanchored MAIC is just a matter of choosing the treatment effect contrast to rely on a relative rather than an absolute endpoint. Seems like a big misunderstanding that should be clarified. Ask David and Jérôme to read it. The confusion between the two seems ever more clear when reading the first paragraph of page 2**: ''*Differences in imatinib dose-escalation regimens are related to both the trial design and conduct of the trial, and, therefore, cannot be adjusted for using NMAs or matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs).''* But in the discussion, their argument for not using anchored MAIC makes more sense, because they basically say that the control arm is not the same across trials.
