These peculiarities don't seem to be linked to the fact that the study compares protocols instead of treatments, relative outcomes differences/rates, and list of covariates adjusted for could have been produced anyway.";"Les auteurs n'ont pas calculé de ""mesure statistique"" du ""downstaging failure"" :
