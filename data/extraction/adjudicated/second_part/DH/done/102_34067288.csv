Mention of the target population 
Almost no description of the PRODIGE clinical trial
Almost no discussion of the assumptions of MAIC, especially of the unanchored ones. Complete overlook of the covariate inclusion criteria. 
We can guess that the variables presented in the table 1 are the ones that have been matched on,  but not completely obvious, and one of the modality of the metastatic sites is not balanced between populations (despite the fact that the d value is very low)
