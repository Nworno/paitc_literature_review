Ongoing clinical trial not published yet doing the same comparison as they do, so could be interesting to look at the actual result of this trial

Adding questions about EudraCT

Evaluates the imbalance in known prognostic factors and effect modifiers

Question about the distinction of prognostic factors and effect modifiers

Maybe reformulate in: 
        - Status of prognostic factors/effect modifiers
        - 

Reformulate 'study number' to 'study numbers'?

New questions to add: 
**
Justification for the need of a population adjusted indirect comparison: 
        - Presence of imbalance in effect modifiers between studies?
**

        - Mention imbalance in effect modifiers to justify population adjusted comparison
        - List the effect modifiers used to adjust the analysis
        - List the prognostic factors used to adjust the analysis
