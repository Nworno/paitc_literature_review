Method : A matching algorithm was developed whereby 1000 samples of the pre-matched analysis set of the SAiL data were selected that resulted in equal distributions of the ECOG PS and gender-matching variables selected. A distribution of survival outcomes was derived by calculating the median PFS estimate from each of the 1000 matched sets. The mean of this distribution provided the PFS point estimates, while a 95% CI was defined by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles.
