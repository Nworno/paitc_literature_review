Partly rely on statistics to select covariate, but don't use pvalues so the first answer doesn't apply : maybe need to reformulate it to pvalues based alone

Specify question of sample size: before or after exclusion of patients that don't meet inclusion criteria? I would say before, because it is already some kind of population adjustment ==> the sample size you would use if you didnt have access to IPD

Strictly follow and refer to guidance from NICE

**Say that they conduct unanchored because it allows to adjust for baseline characteristics better than anchored: seem to confuse Bucher unadjusted ITC and anchored MAIC?? Because unanchored MAIC is just a matter of choosing the treatment effect contrast to rely on a relative rather than an absolute endpoint. Seems like a big misunderstanding that should be clarified. Ask David and JÃ©rÃ´me to read it. The confusion between the two seems ever more clear when reading the first paragraph of page 2**: ''*Differences in imatinib dose-escalation regimens are related to both the trial design and conduct of the trial, and, therefore, cannot be adjusted for using NMAs or matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs).''* But in the discussion, their argument for not using anchored MAIC makes more sense, because they basically say that the control arm is not the same across trials.",Une MAIC par Outcome pour chacune des 2 comparisons (vs Dasatinib et vs Nilotinib)
